This application is based on and claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2015 212178 filed Oct. 28 2015.

The present invention relates to an image recording medium and a method for preparing an image recording medium.

As a method for preparing an image recording medium by forming an image on an image supporting member through an electrophotographic method a method for preparing an image recording medium by forming an image on an image receiving layer of an image transfer sheet through the electrophotographic method and then transferring laminating the formed image onto the image supporting member which is a transfer medium is tested.

an image supporting member that has a ruggedness on a surface and has a surface roughness Rz of 3 m or more 

an image receiving layer that includes a first thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature of 60 C. or more and a second thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature of 15 C. or less and

wherein an image formed of an image forming material is provided between the image supporting member and the image receiving layer and

a ruggedness corresponding to the ruggedness of the image supporting member is formed on an outermost surface of the image recording medium on a side of the transparent supporting member.

The image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment includes an image supporting member having ruggedness on a surface an image receiving layer which includes a first thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature of 60 C. or more and a second thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature of 15 C. or less and a transparent supporting member in this order in which an image formed of an image forming material is provided between the image supporting member and the image receiving layer and a ruggedness corresponding to the ruggedness of the image supporting member is formed on the outermost surface of the image recording medium on the side of the transparent supporting member.

Thus examples of the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface include an aspect having a surface shape in which a concave portion and a convex portion are repeated in succession as an image supporting member illustrated in an aspect having a surface shape in which the convex portions are formed on a portion of the nearly smooth surface as an image supporting member illustrated in and an aspect having a surface shape in which concave portions are formed on a portion of the nearly smooth surface as an image supporting member illustrated in . In addition as fabric which is formed of mutually entangled fibers an aspect having a shape in which a convex portion and a concave portion are always clearly divided but has at least differences in the height on the surface may be also included in the example of the image supporting member.

Meanwhile examples of the image supporting member having the ruggedness include an image supporting member in which surface roughness Rz is 1 m or more and as the surface roughness Rz becomes larger the effect of the exemplary embodiment becomes improved. For this reason in order to further improve the effect the surface roughness Rz of the image supporting member is preferably 3 m or more is further preferably 5 m or more and is still further preferably 7 m or more.

In addition the expression ruggedness corresponding to the ruggedness of the image supporting member means that peak points of the concave portions and convex portions that is a top portion and a bottom portion on the surface having the difference in height are present in the corresponding positions of the image recording medium in the thickness direction. In other words the concave portions and convex portions are present at positions which overlap the ruggedness of the image supporting member in the thickness direction.

Note that the ruggedness of the image supporting member hereinafter also referred to as supporting member ruggedness and the ruggedness of the outermost surface hereinafter also referred to as surface ruggedness on the transparent supporting member side of the image recording medium may have different amplitudes of ruggedness that is a difference in the height as long as the peak points of the convex portions and concave portions are present at the same positions. Accordingly in the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment if the surface ruggedness is formed on at a position where the peak points of the convex portion and the concave portion overlap the supporting member ruggedness in the thickness direction the amplitude the difference in the height of the surface ruggedness may be the same as that of the supporting member ruggedness or may be smaller and gentler than that of the supporting member ruggedness. In this regard it is preferable that the reduction amount of the amplitude the difference in the height of the surface ruggedness is smaller than that of the amplitude the difference in the height of the supporting member ruggedness.

Here an example of the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. is a schematic sectional view illustrating an example of the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment.

An image recording medium includes the image supporting member having the ruggedness the supporting member ruggedness on the surface an image receiving layer B and a transparent supporting member B in this order and the image supporting member and the image receiving layer B has an image which is formed of an image forming material interposed therebetween. In addition as illustrated in the surface ruggedness corresponding to the supporting member ruggedness of the image supporting member is formed on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member B side that is the surface ruggedness is formed so as to overlap the supporting member ruggedness in the thickness direction.

In the related art a method for preparing an image recording medium is attempted. The method is performed in such a manner that an image is formed on an image transfer sheet hereinafter also simply referred to as a transfer sheet through an image forming method such as an electrophotographic method the formed image is transferred laminated onto the image supporting member which is a transfer medium and thus the image recording medium is prepared. Specifically the transfer sheet which includes an image receiving layer a transparent supporting member and a base material in this order is used as the transfer sheet. The image is formed on the image receiving layer of the transfer sheet then the image forming surface is superimposed on the image supporting member in a state of facing each other heating and pressurizing are performed and then the base material is peeled thereby obtaining the image recording medium which is provided with the image supporting member the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member and in which the image supporting member and the image receiving layer has an image interposed therebetween.

Here the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface thereof for example fabric embossed paper leather or the like has a visually and tactually distinctive texture by the ruggedness formed on the surface. When the image is transferred to the image supporting member the transfer medium having the ruggedness on a surface by using the image transfer sheet the image recording medium having the texture by the ruggedness of the image supporting member is required to be prepared. However in a case where the image recording medium is prepared by using the image transfer sheet the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member are transferred onto the image supporting member in a state of interposing the image therebetween and thus the surface shape such as the shape of the transparent supporting member is reflected on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side that is the texture of the supporting member ruggedness is not reflected on the surface ruggedness the amount of ruggedness of the surface is decreased with respect to the amount of ruggedness of the supporting member ruggedness. Accordingly it is not easy that the texture by the ruggedness of the image supporting member is reflected on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side so as to exhibit the above described distinct texture.

In contrast in the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment the image receiving layer includes the first thermoplastic resin having the glass transition temperature of 60 C. or more and the second thermoplastic resin having the glass transition temperature of 15 C. or less. Thus it is possible to obtain the image recording medium in which the amount of ruggedness the surface ruggedness on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side is prevented from being decreased with respect to the amount of ruggedness the supporting member ruggedness on the surface of the image supporting member.

The reason therefor may be considered that the image receiving layer contains the first and second thermoplastic resins which satisfy the above requirement and thus when the image receiving layer is transferred laminated the image receiving layer is deformed in accordance with the ruggedness on the surface of the image supporting member then the transparent supporting member is also deformed in accordance with the deformed image receiving layer and thereby the ruggedness corresponding to the ruggedness on the surface of the image supporting member is also formed on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side.

Here examples of the image supporting member having the ruggedness that is a surface shape having a difference in the height on the surface which is used in the exemplary embodiment include an image supporting member which is formed of a material having a convex portion such as a projection on the surface thereof an image supporting member which is formed of a material having a concave portion such as a hole on the surface thereof an image supporting member having a character a pattern a drawing or the like which is formed into a concave shape or convex shape on the surface and an image supporting member which is formed of mutually entangled fibrous materials.

More specifically examples of the image supporting member include fabric leather paper on which at least one of a concave portion and a convex portion is formed synthetic sponge which is prepared from a urethane resin a melamine resin synthetic rubber or the like a wooden board which uses a forest thinning material or the like and a glass plate a stone plate a metal plate or the like which is subjected to a surface treatment through sandblasting or chemical processing.

Examples of the fabric include a non woven fabric a natural fiber woven fabric and a synthetic fiber woven fabric. Examples of commercially available fabric products include t shirts handkerchiefs sheets towels place mats book covers canvas for painting tote bags bags for small items such as a pouch umbrellas and lamp shades.

Examples of the leather include synthetic leather and natural leather. Examples of commercially available leather products include bags for small items such as a wallet and a pouch bags clothing such as jackets and coats trousers and gloves belts footwear cases for smart phones and seats of for example a chair.

Examples of the paper on which at least one of the concave portion and the convex portion is formed include paper subjected to an embossing crepe process and paper subjected to a debossing process. Examples of commercially available paper products include MERMAID KYANSON WATSON MUSE COTTON LETHAC CREPE PAPER CROC GA AREZAN FS and JACQUARD.

Examples of the synthetic sponge which is prepared from the urethane resin the melamine resin or the synthetic rubber include various types of urethane foams compression semi rigid high elasticity low elasticity high resilience low resilience and the like an ethylenevinyl acetate copolymer EVA sponge foam soft rubber sponge and chloroprene rubber sponge. Examples of commercially available synthetic sponge products include KANE FOAM LUMIACE NOAH FOAM MARSHMALLOW TOUCH and MELAMINE FOAM GEKIOCHIKUN or the like .

Examples of the wooden board which uses a forest thinning material or the like include various types cypress cedar pine and the like of single material plates and various types of veneer plywood such as lauan. Examples of commercially available products of the wooden board which uses a forest thinning material or the like include various boxes BASSWOOD VENEER fancy plywood wooden clock fan wooden boxes coasters bookmarks straps wooden plaque display furniture and photo frame.

Examples of commercially available products of the glass plate the stone plate and the metal plate which are subjected to the surface treatment through sandblasting or chemical processing include window glass glass a name plate and a door plate.

In addition the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface has a visually and tactually distinctive texture by ruggedness formed on the surface.

Next the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. is a schematic sectional view illustrating an example of the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment and is a schematic sectional view illustrating a laminated member which is obtained by superimposing the image transfer sheet on the image supporting member in a superimposing step of a method for preparing the image recording medium according to the exemplary embodiment.

In and reference numerals and respectively represent the transfer sheet the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface and the image recording medium.

On the other hand as illustrated in after performing the heating and pressurizing step and the peeling step preferably after further performing a pressurizing step the image receiving layer B and the transparent supporting member B are deformed in accordance with the ruggedness the supporting member ruggedness on the surface of the image supporting member and the surface ruggedness corresponding to the supporting member ruggedness is formed on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member B side of the image recording medium . For this reason it is possible to obtain the image recording medium in which the amount of the ruggedness the surface ruggedness on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member B side is prevented from being decreased with respect to the amount of the ruggedness the supporting member ruggedness on the surface of the image supporting member . As a result the distinctive texture of the image supporting member is reflected on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member B side of the image recording medium .

Meanwhile the image is in a state of being completely embedded into the surface of the image supporting member and the image receiving layer B. Therefore there is almost no level difference between the surface of the image supporting member and a portion in which the image is formed and the prepared image recording medium has the same texture as that of the image recording medium which is printed as it is and thus the image is not easily peeled.

In addition after performing the peeling step the transparent supporting member B which remains on the image supporting member side functions as an overcoat layer in the image recording medium .

The peeled image recording medium may be the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment as it is in a case where plural individual images are formed on the electrophotographic transfer sheet plural image recording media having a predetermined size may be obtained by cutting each of the aforementioned individual images.

In the exemplary embodiment as a transfer sheet a transfer sheet which includes an image receiving layer a transparent supporting member and a base material in this order is used. In addition in the transfer sheet the image receiving layer includes a first thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature of 60 C. or more and a second thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature of 15 C. or less.

Further the image recording medium is formed on the surface of the transfer sheet of the side on which the image receiving layer is provided through at least a step of forming an image which is formed of an image forming material an image forming step a step of forming a laminated member by superimposing the image transfer sheet on the image supporting member such that the surface side of the image transfer sheet on which the image is formed faces the supporting member a superimposing step a step of heating and pressurizing the laminated member to perform bonding a heating and pressurizing step and a step of peeling the base material from the image transfer sheet a peeling step .

From the viewpoint that the surface ruggedness having higher accuracy corresponding to the supporting member ruggedness is formed on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side and the distinctive texture of the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface is also reflected on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side it is preferable that a step of pressurizing the laminated member from which the base material has been peeled off a pressurizing step is further provided after the peeling step.

As a configuration of layers for the image transfer sheets used in the exemplary embodiment is not particularly limited as long as the configuration has the image receiving layer the transparent supporting member and the base material which satisfy the aforementioned configuration. For example from the viewpoint that the base material is satisfactorily peeled when the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member are transferred to the image supporting member it is preferable that the transparent supporting member and the base material are formed with an adhesive layer interposed therebetween. In addition the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member may be formed with an adhesive layer interposed therebetween.

Hereinafter a configuration example of the transfer sheet will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. However the configuration of the transfer sheet which is employed in the exemplary embodiment is not limited to the configuration illustrated in the drawings as below.

Here in the transfer sheet the peeling strength between the transparent supporting member A and the base material A is set to be smaller than the peeling strength between the image receiving layer A and the transparent supporting member A. For this reason in a case where one outermost surface layer and the other outermost surface layer the base material A and the image receiving layer A in a case of the transfer sheet illustrated in on the transfer sheet are peeled by pinching and pulling each of the end portions of the above layers the transparent supporting member A and the base material A are separated and peeled off.

Particularly in the exemplary embodiment it is preferable that the adhesive layer is formed in an area interposed between the transparent supporting member A and the base material A as illustrated in and in the embodiment it is preferable that the peeling strength between the transparent supporting member A and the adhesive layer is smaller than the peeling strength between the image receiving layer A and the transparent supporting member A and the peeling strength between the adhesive layer and the base material A. That is in a case where one outermost surface layer and the other outermost surface layer the base material A and the image receiving layer A in a case of the transfer sheet illustrated in in the transfer sheet are peeled by pinching and pulling each of the end portions of the above layers it is preferable that the image receiving layer A and the transparent supporting member A and the adhesive layer and the base material A are separated and peeled off.

Further in an interface on which peeling is performed it is preferable that a layer forming one surface and a layer forming the other surface are both peeled off without partial transition.

Here the peeling strength N cm of each interface in each layer forming the transfer sheet is measured by using the following method.

First a sample of the transfer sheet which is cut into a width of 25 mm is prepared and then one outermost surface layer and the other outermost surface layer the base material A and the image receiving layer A in a case of the transfer sheet illustrated in on the sample are peeled by pinching and pulling each of the end portions of the above layers. At this time the layers are peeled on the interface having the smallest peeling strength and thus in the transfer sheet the transparent supporting member A and the base material A are separated and peeled off.

In the aforementioned method the layers are peeled by 6 mm from each of the end portions thereof on the interface having the smallest peeling strength each of the end portions is pinched by using a chuck or a clamp of a tensile testing machine a tensile speed is set to be 300 mm min and then the peeling strength N cm having a peeing angle of 180 degrees is measured.

When the layers are completely peeled off on the interface having the smallest peeling strength by using the above described method the sample is divided into two samples. For example in a case where peeling occurs on the interface between the transparent supporting member A and the adhesive layer on the transfer sheet illustrated in the sample is divided into a sample including the base material A and the adhesive layer and a sample including the image receiving layer A and the transparent supporting member A.

On one of the divided samples one outermost surface layer and the other outermost surface layer for example the image receiving layer A and the transparent supporting member A if it is the sample including the image receiving layer A and the transparent supporting member A are peeled by pinching and pulling each of the end portions of the above layers. At this time if there is any interface on which the peeling occurs the layers are peeled by 6 mm from each of the end portions thereof on the interface each of the peeled end portions is pinched by using a chuck or a clamp of a tensile testing machine a machine is operated with a tensile speed set to be 300 mm min and then the peeling strength N cm having a peeing angle of 180 degrees is measured.

In addition the same method is also applicable to the peeling of the other side of the divided sample for example the sample including the base material A and the adhesive layer if there is any interface on which the peeling occurs the peeling strength of the interface is measured.

However in a case of the transfer sheet as illustrated in it is preferable that the base material A and the adhesive layer are adhered to each other and the transparent supporting member A and the image receiving layer A are adhered to each other such that the peeling does not easily occur on the interface between the base material A and the adhesive layer or the transparent supporting member A and the image receiving layer A. For this reason it is considered that the value of the peeling strength of the interface on which the peeling does not occur becomes larger than the value of the peeling strength of the interface on which the measurement is performed by using the aforementioned method.

In addition the measuring test of the peeling strength by using the above described method may be performed after an image is formed on the image receiving layer of the transfer sheet and the image receiving layer surface is laminated on the image supporting member so as to be the laminated member.

Note that from the viewpoint that it is possible to efficiently prevent the transparent supporting member from being peeled from the image recording medium the peeling strength between the image receiving layer A and the transparent supporting member A is preferably equal to or greater than 6 N cm is further preferably equal to or greater than 10 N cm and is still further preferably equal to or greater than 15 N cm. In addition an upper limit value of the peeling strength is not particularly limited but it is preferably equal to or less than 100 N cm.

In addition from the viewpoint that the base material is satisfactorily peeled when the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member are transferred to the image recording medium the peeling strength between the transparent supporting member A and the base material A is preferably equal to or less than 1 N cm is further preferably equal to or less than 0.1 N cm and is still further preferably equal to or less than 0.03 N cm. Further a lower limit value of the peeling strength is not particularly limited as long as there exists an adhesive force to the extent that the peeling does not occur at the time of normal handling for example lifting by hands setting on a machine and transporting in a machine .

Also from the viewpoint that in a case where the transfer sheet includes the adhesive layer as illustrated in the base material and the adhesive layer are satisfactorily peeled at the time of transferring the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member to the image recording medium it is preferable that the peeling strength between the transparent supporting member A and the adhesive layer is in the above described range.

The image receiving layer in the exemplary embodiment includes at least a first thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature Tg of 60 C. or more and a second thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature Tg of 15 C. or less.

In a case where at least one of a requirement in which the first thermoplastic resin having Tg of 60 C. or more is not included and a requirement in which the second thermoplastic resin having Tg of 15 C. or less is not included is satisfied in the image recording medium it is not possible to form the satisfactory surface ruggedness corresponding to the supporting member ruggedness on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side and also it is not possible to prevent the amount of the surface ruggedness from being decreased with respect to the amount of the supporting member ruggedness. As a result the distinctive texture of the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface is not easily reflected on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side.

Note that the glass transition temperature Tg of the first thermoplastic resin is preferably 65 C. or more and is further preferably 75 C. or more. Also an upper limit value of the glass transition temperature is not particularly limited but is preferably 120 C. or less.

On the other hand the glass transition temperature Tg of the second thermoplastic resin is preferably 10 C. or less and is further preferably 0 C. or less. In addition the lower limit value is not particularly limited but is preferably 40 C. or more.

Here a method for measuring the glass transition temperature Tg of the thermoplastic resin will be described.

10 mg of a sample is put into a pan which is made of aluminum is airtightly sealed and then is measured at a temperature rising speed of 10 C. minute by using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC 220 manufactured by Seiko Instruments Inc. . At this time a temperature of intersection of an extended line of a base line which is equal to or lower than glass transition temperature and a tangential line indicating the maximum inclination in a transition portion is set to be the glass transition temperature Tg .

In addition the weight ratio A B of the content A of the first thermoplastic resin to the content B of the second thermoplastic resin in the image receiving layer is preferably 20 80 to 85 15 is further preferably 25 75 to 75 25 and is still further preferably 40 60 to 50 50.

In addition the total content solid content ratio of the first thermoplastic resin and the second thermoplastic resin in the image receiving layer is preferably in a range of 50 by weight to 100 by weight is further preferably in a range of 60 by weight to 95 by weight and is still further preferably in a range of 65 by weight to 90 by weight.

As the thermoplastic resin which is included in the image receiving layer any thermoplastic resin may be used without particular limitation as long as the requirement of the glass transition temperature is satisfied in the first and second thermoplastic resins described above. Examples of the thermoplastic resin include a homopolymer or copolymer which is obtained by polymerizing one or two or more of styrenes such as styrene vinyl styrene and chlorostyrene monoolefins such as ethylene propylene butylene and isobutylene vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate vinyl propionate vinyl benzoate and vinyl butyrate esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic fatty acid such as methyl acrylate ethyl acrylate butyl acrylate dodecyl acrylate octyl acrylate phenyl acrylate methyl methacrylate ethyl methacrylate butyl methacrylate and dodecyl methacrylate vinyl ethers such as vinyl methyl ether vinyl ethyl ether and vinyl butyl ether vinyl ketones such as vinyl methyl ketone vinyl hexyl ketone and vinyl isopropenyl ketone and diene monomers such as isoprene and 2 chlorobutadiene.

Among these particularly styrenes and esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic fatty acid are preferably used.

Further as the thermoplastic resin which may be used in the exemplary embodiment a polyester resin is preferably used from the viewpoint that the polyester resin is used for the image forming material and thus it is possible to appropriately control the fixing properties of the image forming material onto the transfer sheet surface by containing a resin which is the same type as the polyester resin in the image receiving layer.

Examples of the above described polyester resin also include a silicone modified polyester resin a urethane modified polyester resin and an acryl modified polyester resin other than a typical polyester resin. In addition these polyester resins may be used alone or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination.

The above described polyester resin is prepared by the reaction between a polyvalent hydroxy compound and a polybasic carboxylic acid or a reactive acid derivative thereof. Examples of the polyvalent hydroxy compound forming polyester include diols such as ethylene glycol diethylene glycol triethylene glycol 1 2 propylene glycol 1 3 propylene glycol neopentyl glycol and 1 4 butanediol bisphenol A alkylene oxide adducts such as hydrogenated bisphenol A polyoxyethylenated bisphenol A and polyoxypropylenated bisphenol A and other divalent alcohols and divalent phenols such as bisphenol A.

In addition examples of the polybasic carboxylic acid include malonic acid succinic acid adipic acid sebacic acid an alkyl succinic acid maleic acid fumaric acid mesaconic acid citraconic acid itaconic acid glutaconic acid cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid phthalic acid isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid and other divalent carboxylic acids or reactive acid derivatives thereof such as an acid anhydride alkyl ester and an acid halide.

In addition to these divalent hydroxy compounds and a carboxylic acid a polyvalent tri or higher valent hydroxyl compound or a polybasic tri or higher valent carboxylic acid may be included such that the obtained thermoplastic resin is formed into a non linear form to the extent that tetrahydroxyfuran insolubles are not generated.

Among these particularly a linear saturated polyester resin is preferably used. The linear saturated polyester resin is obtained by polycondensation of phthalic acid as a divalent carboxylic acid with ethylene glycol and neopentyl glycol as a polyvalent hydroxy compound at a predetermined composition ratio. Regarding the aforementioned composition ratio it is preferable that the polymerization is performed by mixing the substances at the following ratios the mole ratio of terephthalic acid to isophthalic acid is 1 1 the mole ratio of ethylene glycol to neopentyl glycol is in a range of 7 3 to 1 9 and the mole ratio of a divalent carboxylic acid and a polyvalent hydroxy compound is 1 1.

In addition in the above described thermoplastic resin the glass transition temperature Tg may be adjusted by a typical method. A method for adjustment for the polyester resin may be exemplified as follows. If a phthalic acid component is contained by 90 or more of the polybasic carboxylic acid component a component of ethylene glycol or neopentyl glycol is contained by 60 or more of the polyvalent hydroxy compound and then the polybasic carboxylic acid component and the polyvalent hydroxy compound are used for the synthesis the polyester resin having high Tg of 60 C. or more may be easily obtained. In addition if sebacic acid or adipic acid is contained by 20 or more of the polybasic carboxylic acid component and then the polybasic carboxylic acid component and the polyvalent hydroxy compound are used for the synthesis the polyester resin having low Tg of 15 C. or less may be easily obtained.

In addition the image receiving layer in the exemplary embodiment contains at least two kinds of thermoplastic resins among the above described thermoplastic resins that is the first thermoplastic resin having Tg of 60 C. or more and the second thermoplastic resin having Tg of 15 C. or less.

Further examples of the resin which forms the image receiving layer include a curable resin such as a heat curable resin a photo curable resin and an electron beam curable resin.

In addition the image receiving layer may contain a release agent such as a natural wax a synthetic wax a releasable resin a reactive silicone compound and modified silicone oil.

Specific examples of the release agent include the natural wax such as a carnauba wax a beeswax a montan wax a paraffin wax and a microcrystalline wax and the synthetic wax such as a low molecular weight polyethylene wax a low molecular weight oxidized polyethylene wax a low molecular weight polypropylene wax a low molecular weight oxidized polypropylene wax a higher fatty acid wax a higher fatty acid ester wax and a sasol wax. These may be used alone or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination.

In addition examples of the releasable resin include a silicone resin a fluororesin a modified silicone resin which is a modified product of the silicone resin and various kinds of resins such as a polyester modified silicone resin a urethane modified silicone resin an acryl modified silicone resin a polyimide modified silicone resin an olefin modified silicone resin an ether modified silicone resin an alcohol modified silicone resin a fluorine modified silicone resin an amino modified silicone resin a mercapto modified silicone resin and a carboxy modified silicone resin a heat curable silicone resin and a photo curable silicone resin.

Further in the exemplary embodiment a reactive silane compound and modified silicone oil may be mixed as the release agent.

These wax and releasable resin may coexist in a particle state or the like however it is preferable that the wax and the releasable resin are added into the thermoplastic resin then are dispersed in the resin such that both are compatible with each other and thus are used in a state of being mixed into the thermoplastic resin.

In addition in the exemplary embodiment it is preferable that a filler is used for the image receiving layer.

The filler which is used in the exemplary embodiment is not limited. However in a case where the filler is formed of organic resin particles specific examples thereof include a homopolymer or copolymer which is obtained by polymerizing one or more of styrenes such as styrene vinyl styrene and chlorostyrene monoolefins such as ethylene propylene butylene and isobutylene vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate vinyl propionate vinyl benzoate and butyric acidvinyl esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic fatty acid such as methyl acrylate ethyl acrylate butyl acrylate acrylic aciddodecyl octyl acrylate phenyl acrylate methyl methacrylate ethyl methacrylate butyl methacrylate and dodecyl methacrylate vinyl ethers such as vinyl methyl ether vinyl ethyl ether and vinyl butyl ether vinyl ketones such as vinyl methyl ketone vinyl hexyl ketone and vinyl isopropenyl ketone and diene monomer such as isoprene and 2 chlorobutadiene.

Among these styrenes esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic fatty acid and the like are preferably used and in a case where these thermoplastic resins are used as the filler it is preferable that thermoplastic resins are coated with a solvent which does not dissolve these resins. Further preferably a heat curable resin having a crosslinking structure obtained by adding a crosslinking agent or the like to these heat melting resins and fine particles of the heat curable resin photo curable resin and electron beam curable resin which are described above are preferably used.

In addition in a case where the filler is formed of inorganic particles specific examples thereof include mica talc silica calcium carbonate zinc white halloysite clay kaolin hydrochloric magnesium carbonate quartz powder titanium dioxide barium sulfate calcium sulfate and alumina.

The filler is typically formed into a spherical particle shape but may be formed into a plate shape a needle shape and an irregular shape.

In addition a volume average particle size of the filler is preferably in a range of 0.1 m to 30 m and is preferably equal to or greater than 1.2 times the film thickness of the image receiving layer.

The weight ratio filler binding agent of the filler to a binding agent a resin component in the image receiving layer of the image transfer sheet is preferably in a range of 0.01 100 to 15 100 and is further preferably in a range of 0.5 100 to 5 100.

As the filler inorganic particles for example SiO AlO talc and kaolin other than the above described inorganic particles and plastic powders in the form of beads for example cross linked PMMA polycarbonate polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene may be used in combination.

As the transparent supporting member a plastic film is representatively used. Among the plastic films a translucent film which used as an OHP film is preferably used. Examples of the translucent film include a poly acetate film a cellulose triacetate film a nylon film a polyethylene terephthalate film a polyethylene naphthalate film a polycarbonate film a polysulfone film a polystyrene film a polyphenylene sulfide film a polyphenylene ether film a cycloolefin film a polypropylene film a cellophane and an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS resin film.

Among these particularly the polyethylene naphthalate film the polyethylene terephthalate film and the polyphenylene sulfide film are preferably used from the viewpoint that when the image recording member is prepared therefrom the surface ruggedness having higher accuracy corresponding to the supporting member ruggedness is formed on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side and the distinctive texture of the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface is also reflected on the outermost surface of the transparent supporting member side.

However a well known unit of moving up and down for example a motor driving method may be applied without being limited to the above unit for moving up and down. In addition the gathering unit is provided with a positioning unit not shown for positioning the end portions of the image supporting member and the transfer sheet which are stacked on each other to be lined up.

In the gathering unit a temporary fixing unit for temporarily fixing a laminated member obtained by stacking two transfer sheets via the image supporting member is provided. For example the temporary fixing unit is formed of a pair of metallic protruding parts so as to be heated by a heater or the like the end portion of the laminated member is pinched by the pair of heated protruding parts and thus the end portion of the laminated member is thermally welded and temporarily fixed.

A temporary fixing method is not limited to the method by a pair of protruding parts as long as thermal welding is employed. For example other existing methods that is a method for causing heated members in the form of needles to pass through a sheet in the vertical direction or pinching a sheet by members mounted with an ultrasonic vibrator and then welding the sheet using heat caused by ultrasonic vibration may be employed.

Examples of the laminating device include a belt nip type device which is formed of a pair of belts . Each of the belts is supported by a heating and pressurizing roll and a supporting roll and also includes pressurizing rolls and .

A pressurizing method in the laminating device is not particularly limited and various conventionally known laminating methods and laminating devices are preferably employed. For example the laminated member is compressed by using a normal laminating method and the laminating device or a heat pressing method and a heat pressing device. The aforementioned methods are performed in such a manner that the laminated member is inserted into the nip portion of a pair of heat rolls or the like and then both transfer sheet and image supporting member of the laminated member are heat melted so as to be welded to each other.

The peeling and re pressurizing device is formed of for example an air ejecting nozzle guides and and a pressurizing belt and a receiver is provided on the downstream side of the transporting passage of the image supporting member.

The peeling and re pressurizing device includes a belt nip type pressurizing belt which is positioned on the downstream side of the air ejecting nozzle and the guides and and on the upstream side of the receiver . The belt nip type pressurizing belt is a pressurizing member for pressurizing the laminated member from which the base material is peeled off and in which a pair of belts come in contact with each other so as to form a nip. Each of belts in the pressurizing belt is supported by a heating and pressurizing roll and a supporting roll and includes pressurizing rolls and . In addition at least the laminated member is pressurized by using the pressurizing member but it is preferable that the laminated member is further heated.

However as the pressurizing method in the pressurizing member it is possible to employ a conventionally known pressurizing method without being limited to the aforementioned method. For example a pressurizing method which is performed by causing the laminated member to pass through a nip portion by the pair of pressurizing rolls a pressurizing method which is performed by causing flat surfaces of a pair of pressurizing members for example two plate shaped pressurizing members having at least one flat surface to interpose the laminated member between the flat surfaces facing each other may be employed.

First in the image forming device a fixed image is formed in such a manner that among the transfer sheets a first transfer sheet stacked on the rear surface the lower side in of the image supporting member is supplied to the image forming unit from the transfer sheet storing unit via the feeding path and a toner image is transferred to and fixed on the upper surface the upper side in of the first transfer sheet by using the electrophotographic method image forming step . At this time the fixed image is formed on the upper surface of the first transfer sheet and thus the first transfer sheet is transported as it is to the discharging port via the feeding path and then is transferred to the gathering device .

In addition in the gathering device the first transfer sheet is supplied to the gathering unit via the feeding path of the gathering device . Here the first transfer sheet which is discharged from the discharging portion of the feeding path is gravitationally supplied to the gathering unit by such that the image surface faces upper surface.

Next the gathering unit is moved up and down to the discharging portion of the feeding path and the image supporting member is supplied to the gathering unit from the image supporting member storing portion via the feeding path . Here the image supporting member which is discharged from the discharging portion of the feeding path is gravitationally supplied to the gathering unit and then is stacked on the first transfer sheet

Next in the image forming device a fixed image is formed in such a manner that a second transfer sheet which is stacked on the front surface the upper side in of the image supporting member is supplied to the image forming unit from the transfer sheet storing unit via the feeding path and a toner image is transferred to and fixed on the upper surface the upper side in of the second transfer sheet by using the electrophotographic method image forming step . The fixed image is formed on the upper surface of the second transfer sheet and thus the second transfer sheet is firstly transferred to the inversion path by passing through the feeding path then returns to the feeding path so as to be transported to the discharging port and then to the gathering device .

At this time in the branched portion between the feeding path and the inversion path when the cam is driven such that the tip end thereof overlaps the feeding path the transporting direction of the second transfer sheet which has reached a portion of the tip end of the cam is changed and the second transfer sheet is guided and transported to the inversion path . In addition after the second transfer sheet approaches the inversion path the second transfer sheet is reciprocated on the inversion path by inverting a driving roll not shown and then is returned to the feeding path . For this reason regarding the second transfer sheet which returns to the feeding path the transporting direction thereof is inverted by 180 the front surface and the rear surface are inverted and the second transfer sheet is transported such that the image surface faces the lower side the lower side in .

In addition in the gathering device the second transfer sheet is supplied to the gathering unit via the feeding path of the gathering device . Here the second transfer sheet which is discharged from the discharging portion of the feeding path is gravitationally supplied to the gathering unit such that the image surface faces the lower surface and then is stacked on the image supporting member .

In this way the first transfer sheet with the upward image surface the image supporting member and the second transfer sheet with the downward image surface are supplied in this order and stacked on each other in the gathering unit positioning step . This laminated member is obtained in such a manner that the image surfaces of the first transfer sheet and the second transfer sheet face each other and then are stacked on each other via the image supporting member .

Subsequently end portions of the first transfer sheet the image supporting member and the second transfer sheet on the gathering unit are positioned to be lined up by using the positioning unit not shown then the end portion of the laminated member is temporarily fixed by the temporary fixing unit and thereafter the laminated member is transported to the laminating device . Meanwhile the positioning is performed by setting the size of the transfer sheet and the image supporting member to the same as each other and then lining up the end portions of the laminated member.

Next in the laminating device the laminated member which is formed of the first transfer sheet the image supporting member and the second transfer sheet is subjected to heating and pressurizing treatment by passing through the nip between a pair of belts and then the image supporting member is heated and compressed by the first transfer sheet and the second transfer sheet heating and pressurizing step .

Thereafter the heated and compressed laminated member is transported to the peeling and re pressurizing device .

When the tip end portion of the laminated member approaches the air ejecting nozzle compressed air is injected from the nozzle. The end portions of the base materials of the respective first transfer sheet and second transfer sheet is lifted from the image supporting member which is obtained by pressurizing the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member and the tip ends of the guides and enter an area which is interposed between the base material of the first transfer sheet and the transparent supporting member and an area which is interposed between the base material of the second transfer sheet and the transparent supporting member. In addition as the laminated member is transported the base materials of two transfer sheets are transported in the direction of being separated from the image supporting member along the guides and and then peeled off from the image supporting member .

Next the laminated member from which the base material is peeled off is subjected to the pressurizing preferably heating and pressurizing by the pressurizing belt as the pressurizing member. Note that the surface of the belt in the pressurizing belt is preferably subjected to the emboss processing in various shapes.

The image supporting member obtained by pressurizing the image receiving layer and the transparent supporting member is discharged to the receiver and a recorded image supporting member may be obtained. Here in a case where plural individual images are formed on the image supporting member the images are cut for each image so as to obtain the image supporting member in a defined size.

Thereafter the base material of the first transfer sheet and the base material of the second transfer sheet are discharged to a transfer sheet receiver via a path not shown .

As described above in the apparatus of preparing the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment the image recording medium is obtained in such a manner that the image is formed on one surface of each of two transfer sheets by the electrophotographic method the image surfaces of the two transfer sheets are caused to face each other via the image supporting member and are heated and compressed and then the base material is peeled off from the transfer sheet.

In addition in the image forming device the inversion path is provided in the middle of the feeding path for transporting the discharging port and the transfer sheet from the image forming unit and among the transfer sheets the first transfer sheet which is supplied to the lower side of the gathering unit does not pass through the inversion path but the second transfer sheet which is supplied to the upper side pass through the inversion path so as to be transported in a state where the front surface and the rear surface are inverted. As in such a state if the front surface and the rear surface of the transfer sheet are selectively inverted it is possible to continuously perform the positioning and thus it is possible to perform printing on an image supporting member further efficiently.

In addition in the method for preparing the image recording medium in the exemplary embodiment as a method for forming an image on the surface of the image receiving layer a well known image forming method such as a method for forming an ink image by using ink is employed other than a method for forming a toner image by using an electrophotographic image forming method.

The superimposing of the transfer sheet on the image supporting member may be performed by positioning the transfer sheet and the image supporting member to be lined up by hands and may be performed in such a manner that after the image is formed on the transfer sheet the transfer sheet and the image supporting member are sequentially discharged to the gathering unit or the like such that the transfer sheet and the image supporting member are positioned to be lined up.

The pressurizing method in the heating and pressurizing step is not particularly limited and various conventionally known laminating methods and laminating devices are preferably employed. Among these a heat pressing method for laminating sheets by applying heat is preferably used. For example the pressurizing may be performed by using a normal laminating method and laminating device which are performed in such manner that the laminated member of the transfer sheet and the image supporting member is inserted into a pressure welding portion nip portion of a pair of heat rolls capable of heating the laminated member and then the transfer sheet and the image supporting member are heat melted to a certain degree so as to be welded to each other.

In the laminated member which is heated and compressed after the image forming material is cooled and solidified the base material of the electrophotographic transfer sheet is peeled off from the image supporting member the image is recorded by transferring the image forming material to the image supporting member and thereby the image recording medium of the exemplary embodiment is prepared.

At the time of cooling and solidifying the image forming material the specific temperature is equal to or lower than a softening point at which the toner hardens for example is equal to or lower than the glass transition temperature of the image forming material and is preferably in a range of 22 C. normal temperature to 50 C. In addition the condition for peeling the transfer sheet from the image supporting member is not particularly limited but it is preferable to slowly peel the transfer sheet from the image supporting member by pinching the end surface of the transfer sheet.

In the exemplary embodiment the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface is used as the image supporting member. Meanwhile examples of the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface include those described above.

LTD Tg 4 C. 1 part by weight of surfactant ELEGAN 264 WAX manufactured by NOF CORPORATION as a thermoplastic resin 3 parts by weight of spherical cross linked methyl polymethacrylate particles SSX 115 manufactured by Sekisui Plastics Co. Ltd. volume average particle size 15 m as a filler are added into a solvent which is 50 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone and are sufficiently stirred.

An adhesive layer coating solution Ca 1 is prepared in such a manner that 20 parts by weight of silicone adhesive XR37 B9204 manufactured by Momentive Performance Materials Inc. solid content concentration 60 and 0.2 parts by weight of the cross linking agent thereof XC93 B6144 manufactured by Momentive Performance Materials Inc. are diluted with 20 parts by weight of toluene and are sufficiently stirred.

An adhesive layer having a film thickness of 7 m is formed in such a manner that one surface side of biaxially oriented PET LUMILAR S10 manufactured by Toray Industries Inc. thickness 75 m as a base material is coated with the above described adhesive layer coating solution Ca 1 by using a wire bar and the coated surface is dried at 120 C. for 2 minutes.

An adhesive layer surface of the base material on which the above described adhesive layer is formed is bonded to one surface side of biaxially oriented PET LUMILAR F53 manufactured by Toray Industries Inc. thickness 6 m as a transparent supporting member under the conditions of normal temperature 22 C. the speed of bonding 0.2 m min and cylinder pressure 588 KPa .

A resistance controlling layer having a film thickness 0.5 m is formed in such a manner that an untreated surface of the base material of the bonded sheet is coated with the above described resistance controlling layer solution Aa 1 by using a wire bar and the coated surface is dried at 120 C. for one minute.

Next a transfer sheet a1 is prepared in such a manner that an untreated surface of the transparent supporting member of the bonded sheet is coated with the above described image receiving layer coating solution Ba 1 by using a wire bar the coated surface is dried at 120 C. for one minute so as to form a receiving layer having a film thickness of 10 m and thereafter the receiving layer is cut into an A4 size 210 mm 297 mm sheet.

A color mirror image including a solid image pattern is formed on the surface of the image receiving layer of the above described transfer sheet a1 the image is not formed by using an image forming device color copying machine DOCUCOLOR 1450GA manufactured by Fuji Xerox Connected to Ltd .

Subsequently white canvas thickness level 11 which is cut into the A4 size is used as the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface and the image is transferred from the transfer sheet a1 on which the above described image is formed to the image supporting member by using the following methods.

In the apparatus for preparing the image recording medium as illustrated in a device including only the laminating device and the peeling and re pressurizing device is prepared. In addition a belt in which the fiber having the surface roughness Rz of 10 m is impregnated with rubber is used as the pressurizing belt in the peeling and re pressurizing device .

The image surface of the transfer sheet a1 and the canvas thickness level 11 are put together into the device including the laminating device and the peeling and re pressurizing device and the image is transferred to the canvas thickness level 11 together with the biaxially oriented PET transparent supporting member thickness 6 m . In this way the image recording medium a1 of the canvas thickness level 11 image supporting member on which a toner image is formed on the surface and is protected by the biaxially oriented PET transparent supporting member is prepared.

Before and after the transferring surface roughness of the image recording medium a1 to which the image is transferred is measured with respect to the surface of the image supporting member before transferring and the surface of the transparent supporting member after transferring . Specifically the measurement is performed for the surface roughness Rz defined based on JIS B0601 1994 and the average interval of the ruggedness of Sm by using SURFCOM 130A manufactured by Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd.

On the surface of the image supporting member before transferring the image and the surface of the transparent supporting member after transferring the image if variation of the average interval of the ruggedness of Sm is small for example equal to or lower than 10 and the surface roughness Rz of the transparent supporting member after transferring the image is equal to or greater than 3 m it is determined that it is possible to follow the surface ruggedness before and after transferring the image and thus obtaining satisfactory appearance.

The scratch resistance of the image surface is confirmed in such a manner that a nylon scrubbing brush SCOTCH BRITE manufactured by 3M Company with abrasive particles 230 mm 150 mm is placed on the image surface of the image recording medium a1 further an 500 g of Al plate which has the same size 230 mm 150 mm as that of the nylon scrubbing brush is placed thereon and the image surface is reciprocated 10 times in the horizontal direction.

It is confirmed that problems are not found such as scratches on the surface and adverse effects on the image.

The heat resistance of the image is confirmed in such a manner that a stainless steel kettle containing one liter of boiling water is placed on the image surface of the image recording medium a1 for 5 minutes.

Plywood which has a thickness of 2 mm and is cut into the A4 size is prepared as the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface. By bonding the image surface of the transfer sheet a1 of Example 1 and the plywood an image recording medium a2 of the plywood in which the toner image is formed on the surface and is protected by the biaxially oriented PET transparent supporting member is prepared in the same way as that used in Example 1 and then the same evaluation as that of Example 1 is performed.

Synthetic leather which is cut into the A4 size with a thickness of 0.9 mm and is embossed in a lizard pattern STH LIZARD No. 9 manufactured by GINGA KOBO is prepared as the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface. The image surface of the transfer sheet a1 of Example 1 and the lizard patterned surface of the synthetic leather are bonded and laminated by using a commercially available laminator LPD3226 manufactured by FUJIPLA Inc. under the conditions of the temperature 140 C. and the speed 0.6 m min . Thereafter the biaxially oriented PET as the base material is peeled off together with the adhesive layer then the laminated member including the toner image between the peeled biaxially oriented PET transparent supporting member and the synthetic leather the image supporting member is inserted to the laminator again. In this way an image recording medium a3 of the synthetic leather having the lizard pattern on which a toner image is formed on the surface and is protected by the biaxially oriented PET transparent supporting member is prepared. Then the same evaluation as that of Example 1 is performed.

Synthetic leather which is cut into the A4 size with a thickness of 0.6 mm and is embossed in a stone pattern SUNNY LEATHER 4101 manufactured by Takashima shoji Co. Ltd. is prepared as the image supporting member having the ruggedness on the surface. By bonding the image surface of the transfer sheet a1 of Example 1 and the stone patterned synthetic leather the image recording medium a4 of the stone patterned synthetic leather in which the toner image is formed on the surface and is protected by the biaxially oriented PET transparent supporting member is prepared in the same way as that used in Example 3 and then the same evaluation as that of Example 1 is performed.

An OHP film CG3500 for color laser printer manufactured by 3M Company A4 size is prepared and an image is formed on the OHP film by using a method described in Image formation of Example 1. Then the image forming surface of the OHP film is coated with a spray adhesive SPRAY ADHESIVE 99 manufactured by 3M Company high strength the adhesive coated surface and the canvas thickness level 11 white A4 size are bonded to each other and similarly to Example 1 the bonded surfaces pass through the laminating device and then similarly to Example 1 are re pressurized by the pressurizing belt without being peeled from each other. In this way an image recording medium b1 of the canvas thickness level 11 image supporting member on which a toner image is formed on the surface and is protected by the OHP film is prepared in the same way as that used in Example 1 and then the same evaluation as that of Example 1 is performed.

As a result the measuring result of the average interval of the ruggedness of Sm after transferring the image is no measured value in other words there is no ruggedness. In addition Rz is 0.1 m which means that the ruggedness is not formed on the surface and the OHP film is merely attached on the surface and thus it is not possible to follow the ruggedness state of the textile canvas thickness level 11 .

Meanwhile regarding the scratch resistance and heat resistance the problems such as scratches and image changes are not found.

A transparent film sheet color laser printer PET manufactured by Quick Art thickness 50 m A4 size is prepared and an image is formed on the image receiving surface of the transparent film sheet by using a method described in Image formation of Example 1. Then similarly to Example 2 the adhesive surface on the side opposite to the side on which the image is formed is boned to the plywood. Subsequently similarly to Example 1 the bonded surfaces pass through the laminating device laminating step and are re pressurized by the pressurizing belt re pressurizing step without being peeled from each other similarly to Example 1. In this way an image recording medium b2 of the plywood on which the transparent film sheet is attached on the surface and a toner image is formed on the outermost surface of the transparent film sheet is prepared. Thereafter the same evaluation as that of Example 1 is performed.

As a result the image is formed on the outer side and thus the offset transition of the image occurs in the laminating step and re pressurizing step thereby preparing the image recording medium having a low image density. Further the measuring result of the average interval of the ruggedness of Sm after transferring the image is no measured value in other words there is no ruggedness. In addition Rz is 0.4 m which means that the ruggedness is not formed on the surface and the transparent film sheet is merely attached on the surface and thus it is not possible to follow the ruggedness state of the plywood.

Meanwhile regarding evaluation of the scratch resistance and heat resistance a portion of the remaining image is further peeled off.

A urethane transfer sheet for textile color laser printer EA CR manufactured by Quick Art A4 size a sheet on which a thin layer of a urethane resin is attached on the surface of release paper is prepared and an image is formed on the surface of the image receiving layer urethane resin of the urethane transfer sheet for textile by using a method described in Image formation of Example 1. Then similar to Example 3 the lizard patterned surface of the synthetic leather STH LIZARD No. 9 manufactured by GINGA KOBO and the image surface of the urethane transfer sheet for textile are bonded to each other. Then the bonded surfaces are laminated by using a commercially available laminator LPD3226 manufactured by FUJIPLA Inc. under the conditions of the temperature 140 C. and the speed 0.6 m min . Thereafter the release paper is peeled off from the urethane transfer sheet for textile.

Here when confirming the surface properties of the outermost surface urethane resin surface the surface properties ruggedness of the urethane resin surface of the urethane transfer sheet for textile are confirmed whereas the lizard pattern ruggedness of the synthetic leather having the lizard pattern is not confirmed. Next when the sheet is inserted into the laminator again the sheet winds around a roll of the laminator. Thus the re pressurizing is performed by lowering the temperature to 100 C. in the laminator and thereby an image recording medium b3 of the synthetic leather having the lizard pattern on which a toner image is formed on the surface and is protected by the thin layer of the urethane resin is prepared. Thereafter the same evaluation as that of Example 1 is performed.

As a result it is confirmed that the lizard pattern ruggedness of the synthetic leather having the lizard pattern is formed on the outermost surface urethane resin surface and thus it is possible to follow the ruggedness of the lizard pattern of the synthetic leather.

However in the scratch resistance evaluation scratches due to the scraping are seen in a portion of the surface. In addition in the heat resistance evaluation the urethane resin and the toner image are partially transitioned on the bottom of the kettle and the image is transitioned to the kettle and thereby the image of the image recording medium b3 becomes partially defective which causes a decrease in the image density.
