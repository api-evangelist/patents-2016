title: Systems and methods for anonosizing data
abstract: Various systems, computer-readable media, and computer-implemented methods of providing improved data privacy, anonymity, and security by enabling subjects to which data pertains to remain “dynamically anonymous,” i.e., anonymous for as long as is desired—and to the extent desired—are disclosed herein. This concept is also referred to herein as “anonosizing.” In some embodiments, the anonosizing of data may be implemented by encoding and decoding data under controlled conditions to support specific uses within designated authorized contexts. By anonosizing data controls via “identifying” and/or “associating” data elements within a population, data uses may be restricted to only those uses permissioned by a data subject or authorized third party. If new authorized data uses arise, all original data value and utility may be retained to support them—to the extent authorized by a data subject or authorized third party—but inappropriate, i.e., non-permissioned, uses of identifying information may be prevented.

This disclosure relates generally to improving data security privacy and accuracy and in particular to using dynamically changing identifiers to render elements of data anonymous.

This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived implemented or described. Therefore unless otherwise indicated herein what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

There are certain inherent conflicts between i the goal of parties to maximize the value of data and their goal of respecting privacy rights of individuals ii the goal of individuals to protect their privacy rights and their goal of benefiting from highly personalized offerings and iii the goal of U.S. and international government agencies to facilitate research and commerce and their goal of safeguarding rights of citizens.

One goal of non healthcare related parties is to reach the most highly qualified prospects i.e. prospective buyers who have the requisite financial resources motivation and authority to make a purchase. Commercial parties will pay much more to reach qualified prospects than to reach undifferentiated prospects because the chances of consummating a transaction with a qualified prospect is significantly higher given their interest predisposition and means to close transactions. The level of personalization customization of offerings for prospective customers which is directly related to the likelihood of consummating transactions is enhanced by the depth and scope of information available about each individual prospect. One goal of healthcare related parties is to conduct research pertaining to health and or disease with the goal of advancing discoveries in applications that may improve human health.

The development emergence and widespread adoption of computer networks internets intranets and supporting technologies has resulted in the wide spread availability of cost effective technology to collect transmit store analyze and use information in electronic formats. As a result entities now have the ability to readily collect and analyze vast amounts of information. This has created tensions between a the increasing quantity of information available to qualify prospects develop personalized customized offerings for potential customers and or conduct health related or other research and b decreasing security anonymity and privacy for individuals who often are not aware of the existence of many data elements that may be traced back to them and over which they often have little or no effective control.

Data elements may be collected both online and offline both born digital and born analog and converted into digital format at a later date through a variety of sources including but not limited to activity on social networking sites electronic or digital records emails participation in rewards or bonus card programs that track purchases and locations browsing or other activity on the Internet and activity and purchases at brick and mortar stores and or on e commerce websites. Merchants medical related and other service providers governments and other entities use this tremendous amount of data that is collected stored and analyzed to suggest or find patterns and correlations and to draw useful conclusions. This data is sometimes referred to as big data due to the extensive amount of information entities may now gather. With big data analytics entities may now unlock and maximize the value of data one example may involve non health related entities engaging in behavioral marketing with materials created for distribution being customized in an attempt to increase the correlation with the preferences pertaining to a particular recipient party and another example may involve heath related entities accessing big data to conduct medical research. However with behavioral marketing and big data analytics related parties now have a much lower level of privacy and anonymity.

Attempts at reconciling the conflict between privacy anonymity and value personalization research have often historically involved using alternative identifiers rather than real names or identifying information. However these alternative identifiers are generally statically assigned and persist over time. Static identifiers are more easily tracked identified and cross referenced to ascertain true identities and may be used to ascertain additional data about subjects associated with data elements without the consent of related parties. Privacy and information experts have expressed concerns that re identification techniques may be used with data associated with static identifiers and question whether data that is identifiable with specific computers devices or activities i.e. through associated static identifiers can in practice be considered anonymous or maintained in a protected state of anonymity. When an identifier does not change over time adversarial entities have unlimited time to accrete analyze and associate additional or even exogenous data with the persistent identifier and thus to determine the true identity of the subject and associate other data with the true identity. In addition unlimited time provides adversarial entities with the opportunity to perform time consuming brute force attacks that can be used against any encrypted data.

Many potential benefits from big data have not been fully realized due to ambiguity regarding ownership usage rights of underlying data tensions regarding privacy of underlying data and consequences of inaccurate analysis due to erroneous data collected from secondary versus primary sources and or inferred from activities of parties without active participation of or verification by said parties.

What are needed are systems methods and devices that overcome the limitations of static and or persistent privacy anonymity and security systems and improve the accuracy of data for exchange collection transactions analysis and other uses especially in identity sensitive and or context sensitive applications. Put another way privacy anonymity enhancing technologies such as those described herein can help to reconcile the tensions between identifiable and functional information by providing tools that enable trust and control in order to achieve the privacy anonymity goals of both individuals and users of such information.

Embodiments of the present invention may improve data privacy and security by enabling subjects to which data pertains to remain dynamically anonymous i.e. anonymous for as long as is desired and to the extent that is desired. Embodiments of the present invention may include systems methods and devices that create access use e.g. collecting processing copying analyzing combining modifying or disseminating etc. store and or erase data with increased privacy anonymity and security thereby facilitating availability of more qualified and accurate information. And when data is authorized to be shared with third parties embodiments of the present invention may facilitate sharing information in a dynamically controlled manner that enables delivery of temporally geographically and or purpose limited information to the receiving party.

As compared to existing systems wherein electronic data may be readily accessible for use e.g. collecting processing copying analyzing combining modifying or disseminating etc. storing and or erasing with few effective controls over the data embodiments of the present invention may use temporally unique dynamically changing de identifiers DDIDs each associated with a subject e.g. a person place or thing to which data directly or indirectly pertains or relates a Data Subject and or an action activity process and or trait pertaining to a Data Subject for a temporally unique period of time thereby enabling the Data Subject to operate in a dynamically anonymous manner. Dynamically anonymous or Dynamic Anonymity as used herein refers to a user s ability to remain anonymous until such time as a decision is made not to remain anonymous at which time only the desired information is shared with one or more desired parties in connection with one or more actions activities processes or traits. Embodiments of the present invention may thereby enable the ability of Data Subjects to maintain flexible levels of privacy and or anonymity under the control of a Data Subject or controlling entity that may be a trusted party or proxy.

Embodiments of the invention may use DDIDs to help prevent the retention of data sometimes referred to as metadata that may otherwise provide third parties with information about one or more aspects of a Data Subject and or data attributes reflecting actions activities processes and or traits pertaining to a Data Subject such as by way of example and not limitation information pertaining to means of creation purpose time and or date of creation identity of the Data Subject and or creator of the data attributes location where data attributes were created standards used in creating or using data attributes etc. This is due to the fact that metadata must have something to attach itself to or to associate itself with in order to establish an ongoing record of information associated with one or more specific data attributes. The words data attributes elements or similar terms used in this application will include any or all of the following as applicable i structured data i.e. data in predetermined structured schemas ii unstructured data iii metadata i.e. data about data iv other data and or v any of the foregoing types of data initially recorded in analog format and later converted into digital format.

Embodiments of the present invention may use a first DDID at one time for a specific purpose pertaining to a first Data Subject action activity process and or trait and then use a second DDID in association with the first Data Subject action activity process and or trait for a different purpose and or use the first DDID in association with a second Data Subject action activity process and or trait for a different purpose etc. As a result attempts to retain and aggregate data associated with underlying information associated with DDIDs may be ineffective since different DDIDs may be associated with the same Data Subject action activity process and or trait and or the same DDID may be used with different Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits and or purposes each for a temporally unique period of time.

Embodiments of the present invention may track and record different DDIDs used by and associated with Data Subjects at different times with respect to various actions activities processes or traits thereby enabling the storage selection and retrieval of information applicable to a specific action activity process or trait and or a specific Data Subject. Conversely the system may not enable third parties external to the system to effectively retain and aggregate data due to the use of multiple DDIDs and the lack of information available external to the system to determine relationships between and among DDIDs and or Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits.

Each DDID may be associated with any one or more data attributes to facilitate with respect to a specific action activity process or trait such as by way of example and not limitation a information reflecting an action activity process or trait associated with a Data Subject while associated with a current DDID e.g. browsing information reflecting current web based activity of a Data Subject while being associated with a current DDID before the current DDID is replaced with a different DDID b information with respect to past actions activities processes or traits previously associated with a Data Subject while associated with one or more previous DDIDs but with respect to which the Data Subject now desires to share information with a third party while associated with the current DDID e.g. sharing pricing information with an e commerce website that the Data Subject collected from said website in a previous browsing session while being associated with a previous DDID and c new information that may help facilitate with respect to a desired action activity process or trait on behalf of the Data Subject while associated with a current DDID e.g. indicating new desired size and color for a currently desired purchase of clothing from an e commerce website . For purposes hereof the combination of a DDID and any data elements associated with the DDID for a temporally unique period of time are referred to as a temporal data representation or a TDR. For purposes hereof if no data is associated with a DDID then a DDID and its temporal data representation or TDR are identical.

From the perspective of an implementation of an embodiment of Dynamic Anonymity being a closed system a DDID intended to represent the identity of a Data Subject i.e. a primary identifier is required to be temporally unique during the time period of the assignment of the DDID to the Data Subject i.e. no two extant Data Subjects can have identical primary identifier DDIDs at the same time. The requirement for temporal uniqueness of DDIDs is applicable when separateness of identity of Data Subjects is desired to be represented by DDIDs if factors other than separateness of identity of Data Subjects are desired to be represented by DDIDs DDID assignments can be made accordingly to represent intended associations relationships etc. DDIDs can be instantiated in two ways i within an implementation of the present invention or ii by externally created identifiers but only provided that they satisfy the temporally unique requirement e.g. a cookie or other unique identifier assigned by a web site to a first time visitor could effectively serve as a DDID when separateness of identity of Data Subjects is desired to be represented by DDIDs.

A cookie is a small piece of data that is generally sent from a web site and stored in a Data Subject s web browser while the Data Subject is browsing the website so that every time the Data Subject returns to the website the browser sends the cookie back to a server associated with the website to notify the website the Data Subject has returned to the website. However in order for a cookie to serve as a DDID the browser serving as the client in this potential embodiment of the invention may prevent any cookie submitted by the website from persisting between browsing sessions e.g. by copying the user s cookies cache and browsing history files to the anonymity system s servers and then deleting them off the user s computer such that a new cookie may be assigned for each browsing session. In this manner the various cookies in this example embodiment serving as DDIDs representing separateness of identity of Data Subjects issued by the website while being created externally to the system would each be unique and would not enable the website to remember stateful information or aggregate the Data Subject s browsing activity since each of the browsing sessions would be perceived by the website as unrelated thereby enabling the Data Subject to remain dynamically anonymous as long as desired to the extent desired.

As mentioned in the example potential embodiment above the Dynamic Anonymity system according to some embodiments may collect and retain information related to the various actions activities processes or traits associated with the different browsing sessions different cookies in this example serving as DDIDs representing separateness of identity of Data Subjects and store the combined information in an aggregated data profile for the Data Subject until such time as a decision is made by or on behalf of the Data Subject to no longer remain anonymous at which point only desired information from the Data Subject s aggregated data profile need be shared with one or more desired parties in connection with one or more actions activities processes or traits. In this exemplary embodiment of the invention this may involve the Data Subject deciding to provide information to a website from the Data Subject s aggregated data profile as a TDR that reflects past activity of the Data Subject on the website all at the election and control of the Data Subject or other controlling entity . In the above exemplary embodiment of the invention in lieu of using cookies assigned by a website visited by a Data Subject as DDIDs the system may alternatively use globally unique identifiers GUIDs i.e. unique reference numbers used as identifiers in computer software or other temporally unique dynamically changing proxy de identifiers as DDIDs whether created internally by or externally to implementations of the present invention. In the above examples control over the collection of data resulting from browsing activity by a Data Subject would reside with the Data Subject or other controlling entity rather than with the websites visited by the Data Subject. In still other exemplary embodiments of the invention rather than the Data Subject deciding when to send i.e. push information to the website from the Data Subject s aggregated data profile a website with proper permissions and authentication could request i.e. pull the relevant information and or relevant DDID to Data Subject association information from the Data Subject s aggregated data profile at such time that the information is needed by the website.

In still other exemplary embodiments of the invention the work to dynamically anonymize and control the sending of the relevant portions of the Data Subject s aggregated data profile may be handled by the Data Subject s client device itself the central Dynamic Anonymity system referred to above or a combination of the two. For example a complete view of a particular Data Subject s information and or relevant DDID to Data Subject association information for a predetermined or flexible amount of time could be stored at the Data Subject s client device for the predetermined or flexible amount of time before then being synchronized back to a central Dynamic Anonymity system as well as synchronized with any other client devices that the Data Subject may have registered with the central anonymity system .

TDRs and DDIDs may comprise multiple levels of abstraction for tracking and identification purposes. A system according to some embodiments of the present invention may store the TDRs consisting of DDID values and data elements if any associated with the DDIDs as well as information regarding the time period during which each DDID was associated with a particular Data Subject data attribute s action activity process or trait thereby allowing the TDRs to be re associated at a later time with the particular Data Subject data attribute s action activity process or trait. Such a system may be utilized to facilitate the development of aggregated data profiles by reference to and with the use of keys that reveal the relationship between and among various DDIDs Data Subjects data attributes s actions activities processes and or traits. In other words Dynamic Anonymity as afforded by the use of TDRs and or DDIDs as described herein may enable Data Subjects to benefit from ongoing technological advancements e.g. the Internet of Things IoT personalized medicine etc. without having to relinquish privacy anonymity security or control. This may be accomplished by i assigning unique dynamically changing DDIDs to Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits ii retaining information regarding association of DDIDs with Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits and iii providing Data Subjects and or controlling entities that may be trusted parties proxies with deterministic control over access to use of association information. With the use of dynamically changeable temporally unique and re assignable DDIDs current systems and processes e.g. web browsers and data analytic engines may not be able to recognize relationships between and among disassociated and or replaced data elements. They may still process information using existing capabilities but will do so without creating inferences correlations profiles or conclusions except as expressly authorized by Data Subjects and trusted parties proxies. Moreover the DDIDs employed by embodiments of the present invention can be replaced dynamically at the data element level enabling Dynamic Anonymity not just at the Data Subject level or data record level. This means that individuals may have control over what data is shared or accessed enabling dynamic de identification without de valuation of the underlying information.

Control of information down to the data element level makes controlled information sharing possible in the age of big data beyond the reach of controls targeted only at the data record level or Data Subject level. It further enables a one and done relationship between a Data Subject and a website or other entity receiving information about the Data Subject. Most existing systems collect information around a unique identifier over time. Even if a DDID carries with it a certain amount of history or other information pertaining to a Data Subject the next time the Data Subject visits the site store doctor etc. the Data Subject could look like a completely different Data Subject if desired. Only when and if the DDID contained a unique identifier a name or email address for example could a recipient correlate a then current DDID representing the Data Subject with a DDID previously used to represent the Data Subject at which point the recipient could interact with the Data Subject based on the recipient s collection of data on the Data Subject. However the next time the recipient encounters the Data Subject the Data Subject would not be re identifiable unless desired by the Data Subject.

Dynamic Anonymity also enables controlled data fusion wherein data fusion is defined as being what occurs when data from different sources are brought into contact with each other and new facts emerge by providing controlled anonymity for data identity of the Data Subject and or the controlling entity and context e.g. time purpose place by obfuscating connections between and among the foregoing. Dynamic Anonymity thus also enables the undoing or reversal of either rights granted or access to data e.g. a particular party could be provided with access to data underlying a DDID then have their access revoked via the changing of Replacement Keys as well as the rejuvenation of data i.e. of the values of the data not necessarily re identification of data to support additional authorized secondary uses without violating promises to Data Subjects e.g. one or more DDIDs may initially provide access via one or more Replacement Keys to the results of an X ray and via the changing of Replacement Keys later reflect the results of the X ray as well as results of follow on physical therapy .

The reason Dynamic Anonymity will still be attractive in the commercial marketplace is that companies often do not actually care who the Data Subjects they interact with are i.e. their actual real world identities they instead care what the Data Subjects are how the Data Subjects behave and when the Data Subjects behave that way. The more accurate their targeting is and the less wasteful the more likely an anonymous consumer will respond favorably to a personalized offering. Dynamic Anonymity thus obviates the need for companies to follow Data Subjects around the digital world to try to persuade them to buy products and or services that they may not really need or want. Dynamic Anonymity allows for more profitable matching of sellers and interested customers. Currently the best that many companies can do is to segment potential customers by using demographics and statistics but they may have no idea of the actual interest of individual segment members. Dynamic Anonymity also improves upon generalized demographics and statistics by providing individualized expressions levels of expression of interest from members of segments who are highly qualified prospects. The ability of Dynamic Anonymity to enable Data Subjects to directly or indirectly control use of their data in accordance with their personal privacy anonymity preferences can support disparate treatment of data in disparate jurisdictions notwithstanding different data use privacy anonymity requirements in such jurisdictions e.g. differences between European Union fundamental right and U.S. balancing of privacy rights right to free expression commerce perspectives on data privacy anonymity protection .

In the context of healthcare medical related and other areas of research Dynamic Anonymity will be more attractive than traditional approaches to de identification that protect data privacy anonymity by using a defensive approach e.g. a series of masking steps are applied to direct identifiers e.g. name address and masking and or statistically based manipulations are applied to quasi identifiers e.g. age sex profession in order to reduce the likelihood of re identification by unauthorized third parties. This defensive approach to protecting data privacy anonymity results in a tradeoff between protecting against re identification and retaining access to usable information. In comparison with Dynamic Anonymity the value of information can be retained and leveraged exploited for authorized purposes all with a statistically insignificant risk of re identification of any datum. DDIDs can be used to represent actions activities processes and or traits between and among Data Subjects the meaning of which may change over time thereby requiring the then current appropriate key s to discern underlying values. Dynamic Anonymity therefore rejects the proposition and traditional dichotomy that in order to minimize the risk of anonymity loss one must sacrifice information content by making it forever unrecoverable. Instead Dynamic Anonymity minimizes both the risk of privacy anonymity loss and the amount of information lost enabling most if not all of it recoverable but only with authorization.

Keys used by embodiments of the present invention may vary depending on the use of corresponding DDIDs. For example time keys TKs may be used to correlate the time period of association between a DDID and a Data Subject action activity process and or trait i.e. the time period of existence of a TDR association keys AKs may be used to reveal the association between two or more data elements and or TDRs that may not otherwise be discernibly associated one with another due to the use of different DDIDs replacement keys RKs may be used if when DDIDs are used in replacement of one or more data attributes within a TDR in which case look up tables may be referenced to determine the value of the one or more data attributes replaced by the said one or more DDIDs included within the TDR.

Without access to the applicable TK s AK s and or RK s in the event that a third party intercepts information pertaining to one or more Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits the third party would not be able to i re identify a Data Subject by means of associating DDIDs and corresponding data attributes which together comprise TDRs in the case of the association function of the present invention and or ii knowing the value of data elements represented by DDIDs so as to correctly understand the information in the case of the replacement function of the present invention. Conversely embodiments of the present invention may enable a Data Subject or other controlling entity to send to one or more desired third parties only those data attributes which the system knows relate to the Data Subject by virtue of the tracking logging recording functions of the system that specifically pertain to a specific action activity process or trait.

Disclosed herein are various systems methods and devices for private and secure management and use of information pertaining to one or more Data Subjects such as persons places or things and associated actions activities processes and or traits. The systems methods and devices described herein may abstract data pertaining to Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits by linking elements pertaining to the data into independent attributes or dependent attributes separating elements pertaining to the data into independent attributes or dependent attributes. For purposes of this disclosure an attribute refers to any data element that can be used independently or in combination with other data elements to directly or indirectly identify a Data Subject such as a person place or thing and associated actions activities processes and or traits. It should be noted that a Data Subject may have attributes or attribute combinations that are unique to the Data Subject for example an individual Data Subject s social security number as well as attributes or attribute combinations that are shared by the Data Subject with other Data Subjects for example an individual Data Subject s sex or affiliation with a political party. In some instances an attribute may be an electronic or digital representation of a Data Subject or associated action activity process and or trait. Similarly attributes may be electronic or digital representations of information or data related to a Data Subject or associated action activity process and or trait. Separating linking combining rearranging defining initializing or augmenting the attributes can form attribute combinations pertaining to any particular Data Subject or group of Data Subjects or associated actions activities processes and or traits. With respect to any Data Subject action activity process and or trait the attribute combinations may include any combination of attributes as well as other data that is added to or combined with the attributes. It should be further noted that an attribute or combination of data attributes may identify a Data Subject but are not themselves the Data Subject the person or legal entity identified by an attribute or combination of data attributes may be the subject of said attribute or combination of data attributes and considered a related party with regard thereto since he she it has an interest in or association with said attribute or combination of data attributes. In addition parties other than a Data Subject identified by an attribute or combination of data attributes who have an interest in or association with an attribute or combination of data attributes may also be considered related parties with regard to the attribute or combination of data attributes.

In some embodiments a client server structure or architecture may be utilized to implement one or more features or aspects of this disclosure whether on premises in or across an enterprise in a private or public cloud in a private or public hybrid cloud or in any combination of the foregoing whereby in one example a privacy server which may be virtual logical or physical provides functions and or services to one or more privacy clients which themselves may be virtual logical or physical. These privacy clients that may reside on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and reside in a cloud network or reside on the same computing device as the privacy server may initiate requests for such functions and or services by interacting with data attributes and or data attribute to Data Subject association information stored in a database on a hard drive or other memory element associated with the privacy server. For example a data attribute may be linked to independent attributes or dependent attributes or separated into independent attributes or dependent attributes by means of a privacy server coupled to the database in response to requests for functions and or services from one or more privacy clients. It should be noted that implementations of the invention may use a single computer or computing device as both a privacy server and a privacy client whereas other implementations may use one or more computers or computing devices located in one or more locations as a privacy server and one or more computers or computing devices located in one or more locations as a privacy client. A plurality of system modules may be used to perform one or more of the features functions and processes described herein such as but not limited to determining and modifying required attributes for attribute combinations assigning DDIDs tracking DDID use expiring or re assigning existing DDIDs and enabling or providing data associations relevant to or necessary with respect to a given action activity process or trait.

In one embodiment these modules may include an abstraction module of the privacy server configured to among other things dynamically associate at least one attribute with at least one Data Subject action activity process and or trait determine and modify required attributes relevant to or necessary for a given action activity process or trait generate store and or assign DDIDs to the at least one data attribute to form a TDR and assign a predetermined expiration to a TDR by means of the DDID component of the TDR.

These system modules and if desired other modules disclosed herein may be implemented in program code executed by a processor in the privacy server computer or in another computer in communication with the privacy server computer. The program code may be stored on a computer readable medium accessible by the processor. The computer readable medium may be volatile or non volatile and may be removable or non removable. The computer readable medium may be but is not limited to RAM ROM solid state memory technology Erasable Programmable ROM EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM EEPROM CD ROM DVD magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage or other magnetic or optical storage devices. In certain embodiments privacy clients may reside in or be implemented using smart devices e.g. wearable movable or immovable electronic devices generally connected to other devices or networks via different protocols such as Bluetooth NFC WiFi 3G etc. that can operate to some extent interactively and autonomously smartphones tablets notebooks and desktop computers and privacy clients may communicate with one or more privacy servers that process and respond to requests for information from the privacy clients such as requests regarding data attributes attribute combinations and or data attribute to Data Subject associations.

In one implementation of the present invention DDIDs associated with attributes and attribute combinations may be limited in scope and duration. Further DDIDs may be re assignable such that a DDID may refer to multiple Data Subjects or multiple actions activities processes or traits at different points in time. The DDIDs may be re assignable on a configurable basis in order to further abstract and dilute or attenuate data trails while maintaining the timeliness and saliency of the TDRs and data contained therein.

In one example rather than storing transmitting or processing all data attributes pertaining to a Data Subject and or relevant to or necessary for a given action activity process or trait embodiments of the present invention may introduce an initial layer of abstraction by means of an association function e.g. by including only a portion of the relevant data attributes in each TDR. In this way the data attributes pertaining to a Data Subject may be disassociated within seemingly unrelated TDRs such that access to and use of one or more AKs are necessary in order to know which two or more TDRs must be associated with each other in order to collectively contain all the data attributes pertaining to a Data Subject and or that are relevant to or necessary for a given action activity process or trait. The privacy anonymity and security of data attributes contained or referenced within a TDR may be further improved or enhanced by means of a replacement function e.g. by replacing one or more of said data attributes contained in one or more TDRs with DDIDs so that access to and use of one or more RKs are necessary to enable use of look up tables to determine the value of the one or more data elements replaced by said one or more DDIDs. The privacy anonymity and security of data attributes contained or referenced within a TDR may be further improved or enhanced by using other known protection techniques such as encrypting tokenizing pseudonymizing eliding and or otherwise and or by introducing additional layers of abstraction by replacing keys with second level or n level DDIDs.

In the case of both disassociation of data attributes pertaining to a Data Subject action activity process and or trait so as to require AKs and replacement of data attributes pertaining to a Data Subject action activity process and or trait so as to require RKs the effective level of privacy anonymity and security may be enhanced based on how and how often the DDIDs associated with the data attribute or attributes in question are changed and or are changeable. In one exemplary embodiment of the invention DDIDs may be assigned for purposes of disassociation and or replacement and retain their initially assigned value s i.e. permanent assignments. In another exemplary embodiment of the invention DDIDs may be assigned for purposes of disassociation and or replacement and retain their initially assigned value s until the value s are changed on an ad hoc basis i.e. ad hoc changeability. In yet another exemplary embodiment of the invention DDIDs may be assigned for purposes of disassociation and or replacement and retain their initially assigned value s until the value s are changed based on a random fixed variable or other dynamic basis i.e. dynamic changeability. 

Embodiments of the present invention may create additional layers of abstraction by replacing identifying references within the system to external networks internets intranets and or computing devices that may be integrated or communicate with one or more embodiments of the present invention with DDIDs so that one or more RKs and or AKs are necessary to enable access to and use of look up tables to determine the identity of the one or more external networks internets intranets and or computing devices replaced by said one or more DDIDs.

Due to the changeable temporally unique and re assignable characteristics of DDIDs paired with data attributes or attribute combinations to create TDRs recipients of TDRs may make use of information contained in TDRs specifically for intended purposes at intended times. This is due to the fact that Association Keys which may be required to stitch TDRs together to make sense of information contained in seemingly unrelated TDRs and or Replacement Keys which may be required to know the value of information represented by temporally unique DDIDs sent to third parties as part of TDRs may only have temporally limited usefulness. In other words the usefulness is temporally limited because the DDID components of TDRs may be changed by a Data Subject or other controlling party when the intended purpose and or intended time is no longer applicable in such a manner that AKs and or RKs no longer reveal relevant information. Conversely relevant information revealed by means of AKs and or RKs may change over time to support additional secondary uses of data.

In one example a maintenance module may be utilized to store information regarding the association at any particular point in time of a particular DDID with a particular attribute combination in a TDR in a secure database associated with the privacy server and accessible by the system but not accessible by parties other than the controlling entity or by parties authorized by the controlling entity this time period of association may be represented by a time key TK or otherwise . In one example the maintenance module of the privacy server and associated database s may store and keep all associations of DDIDs with attribute combinations. Thus the system provides for secure data exchange and non repudiation of data attributes attribute combinations and TDRs in order to foster safer data related collection use research and or analysis while meeting stringent privacy anonymity and security criteria.

In one example a verification module of the privacy server and associated database s may provide an authenticated data structure that permits validation and verification of the integrity of information and or DDIDs embodied in an aggregated data profile data attributes attribute combinations and or TDRs at any point in time through methodologies such as cyclic redundancy checks CRCs message authentication codes digital watermarking linking based time stamping or analogous methodologies.

In another example an authentication module of an embodiment of the present invention may be used to verify on an anonymous basis the authority to proceed with respect to a Data Subject action activity process or trait at a particular time and or place via the TDR assignment. A privacy client with TDR information may request of the authentication module which in one example is part of the privacy server confirmation as to whether the TDR and undisclosed Data Subject data attributes or attribute combinations associated therewith is authorized to participate with regard to a requested action activity process or trait at a particular time and or place. In one embodiment the authentication module may compare the DDID included in the TDR to a list of authorized DDIDs to determine the state of authorization to participate with respect to a desired action activity process or trait at the specified time and or place. Optionally the authentication module may request the party possessing the TDR to confirm it is authorized to participate with respect to a desired action activity process or trait at the specified time and or place through DDID confirmation or other confirmation techniques such as password confirmation or multi factor authentication. If an optional authorization request is made the process continues only if the party is authorized in one example. The authentication module may transmit the authorization status information to the party controlling the TDR via a privacy client and the authorization status may be used to allow or deny proceeding with respect to a desired action activity process or trait at the specified time and or place.

TDRs and or DDIDs contained in TDRs can also be used as advanced keys for known protection techniques such as encrypting tokenizing pseudonymizing eliding or otherwise. The authentication module may be used to withhold the key necessary to unlock protection techniques for the contents of the TDR such as encrypting tokenizing pseudonymizing eliding or otherwise unless the TDR DDID undisclosed associated Data Subject attribute attribute combination or related party is confirmed as being authorized to participate with respect to a desired action activity process or trait at the specified time and or place through DDID and or TDR confirmation and known confirmation techniques such as password confirmation multi factor authentication or similar means.

In another example an access log module may be provided wherein the access log module can collect and store information to enable post incident forensic analysis in the event of a system or privacy server error and or misuse.

In accordance with one aspect of one embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein is a computer implemented method of providing controlled distribution of electronic information. In one example the method may include the steps or operations of receiving at a computing device data identifying one or more attributes of the data selecting through the computing device a DDID associating the selected DDID with one or more of the data attributes and creating a temporally unique data representation TDR from at least the selected DDID and the one or more data attributes.

In one example the step of selecting a DDID may include generating the temporally unique dynamically changing DDID or in another example accepting or modifying a temporally unique dynamically changing value created external to the system to serve as the DDID.

For purposes hereof the phrase dynamically changing means that a DDID assigned with respect to a data subject action activity process or trait a changes over time due to i passage of a predetermined amount of time ii passage of a flexible amount of time iii expiration of the purpose for which the DDID was created or iv change in virtual or real world location associated with the data subject action activity process or trait or b is different at different times i.e. the same DDID is not used at different times with respect to a same or similar data subject action activity process or trait.

For purposes hereof the phrase temporally unique means that the time period of assignment of a DDID to a data subject action activity process or trait is not endless. The initial assignment of a DDID to a data subject action activity process or trait starts at a point in time and information concerning the time of assignment is known and in certain implementations of the present invention may be used to identify relationships or connections between the DDID and said data subject action activity process or trait. If the period of assignment of a DDID to a data subject action activity process or trait ends at a discrete point in time information concerning the time of termination of assignment is known and in certain implementations of the present invention may be used to identify relationships or connections between the DDID and said data subject action activity process or trait.

In another example the method may also include causing the association between the selected DDID and the one or more data attributes to expire. In yet another example the method may include storing in a database accessible to the computing device information regarding the time periods during which the selected DDID was associated with different data attributes or combinations of attributes by means of time keys TKs or otherwise.

In another embodiment the method may also include re associating the selected DDID with one or more other data attributes or attribute combinations following expiration of the association between the DDID and one or more initial data attributes.

In one example the expiration of the DDID occurs at a predetermined time or the expiration may occur following completion of a predetermined event purpose or activity. In another example the DDID may be authorized for use only during a given time period and or at a predetermined location.

In another example the method may include changing the DDID associated with the one or more data attribute attribute combination and or TDR wherein the changing the DDID may occur on a random or a scheduled basis or may occur following the completion of a predetermined activity purpose and or event.

According to another aspect of another embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein is a method for facilitating transactions over a network wherein the method may include the operations of receiving a request at a privacy server from a client device to conduct activity over a network determining which of a plurality of data attributes or attribute combinations in a database is necessary to complete the requested activity creating or accepting a DDID associating the DDID with the determined data attributes to create a combined temporally unique data representation TDR making the combined temporally unique data representation TDR accessible to at least one network device for conducting or initiating the requesting activity receiving a modified temporally unique data representation TDR that includes additional information related to the activity performed and storing the modified temporally unique data representation TDR and or DDID to Data Subject association information in a memory database.

In one example the at least one network device may include an internet service provider a server operated by a merchant or service provider a server operated by a mobile platform provider or a server in a cloud computing environment.

According to another aspect of another embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein is a method of providing controlled distribution of electronic information. In one example the method may include receiving a request at a privacy server to conduct an activity over a network selecting attributes of data located in a database accessible to the privacy server determined to be necessary to fulfill the request wherein other attributes of the data which are not determined to be necessary are not selected assigning or accepting the assignment of a DDID to the selected attributes and or attribute combinations to which they apply with an abstraction module of the privacy server wherein the DDID does not reveal the unselected attributes recording the time at which the DDID is assigned receiving an indication that the requested activity is complete receiving the DDID and the determined attributes and or attribute combinations to which they apply at the privacy server wherein the attributes are modified to include information regarding the conducted activity and recording the time at which the conducted activity is complete and the DDID and the determined attributes and or attribute combinations to which they apply are received at the privacy server.

In one example the method may also include assigning an additional DDID to one or more of the selected data attributes and or attribute combinations contained within a TDR. In another example the method may include re associating using time keys TKs reflecting recorded times the DDID and data attributes with the true identity of the data attributes attribute combinations or Data Subjects. The method may also include reassigning the DDID to other data attributes and recording the time at which the DDID is reassigned.

According to another aspect of another embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein is a computer implemented method of improving data security wherein the data comprises at least one attribute. In one example the method may include associating at least one attribute with a DDID to create a temporally unique data representation TDR wherein the temporally unique data representation TDR limits access to data attributes to only those necessary to perform a given action such as for example completing a purchase of goods from an online website.

In one example the method may include assigning an association key AK to the temporally unique data representation TDR wherein access to the association key AK is required for authorized access to the temporally unique data representation TDR .

In another example the method may also include causing the association between the DDID and the at least one attribute to expire wherein the expiration occurs at a predetermined time and or the expiration may occur following completion of a predetermined event and or activity. In another embodiment the method may include re associating the DDID with the at least one different attribute following an expiration of the association between the DDID and the at least one attribute. The method may also include storing in a database information regarding one or more time periods during which the DDID was associated with different data attributes or combinations of attributes as reflected by applicable time keys TKs or otherwise.

According to another aspect of another embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein is a system for improving electronic data security. In one example the system may include a module configured to dynamically associate at least one attribute with at least one Data Subject action activity process and or trait a module configured to generate or accept DDIDs and further configured to associate DDIDs to the at least one data attribute a module configured to track activity related to the DDIDs and configured to associate any additional electronic data generated by the activity to the DDID and a module for storing the DDIDs tracked activity and time periods during which a DDID is used for conducting the tracked activity.

According to another aspect of another embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein is a device for conducting secure private activity over a network. In one example the device may include a processor configured to execute program modules wherein the program modules include at least a privacy client a memory connected to the processor and a communication interface for receiving data over a network wherein the privacy client is configured to receive temporally unique data representations TDRs including DDIDs and associated data attributes necessary for conducting the activity over the network from a privacy server.

In one example the privacy client may be further configured to capture activity conducted using the device and to relate the conducted activity to the temporally unique data representations TDRs . In another example the privacy client may be configured to transmit the captured activity and temporally unique data representations TDRs to the privacy server. The privacy client may reside on a mobile device as a mobile application in one example. The privacy client may reside in and be accessible via a network as a cloud based application in another example. The privacy client may reside on the same computing device s on which the privacy server s resides as a local application in another example.

In another example the device may also include a geolocation module on a mobile device wherein the temporally unique data representations TDRs are modified with information from the geolocation module and wherein the temporally unique data representations TDRs restrict access to information regarding the identity of the device. The device may also include a user interface configured to allow a user to modify the temporally unique data representations TDRs including options to change the DDID or data attributes associated with a particular temporally unique data representation TDR . The user interface may include selectable options for sharing the temporally unique data representations TDR only with other network devices within a predetermined physical virtual or logical proximity to the mobile device.

In another example the device may in response to the shared temporally unique representations TDRs receive targeted advertising or marketing information based on the physical virtual or logical location of the mobile device wherein the shared temporally unique data representations TDRs may in one example include demographic information temporal information geolocation information psychographic information and or other forms of information related to a user of the mobile device. In another example the shared temporally unique data representations TDRs may include information related to purchase transactions made or desired to be made using the mobile device and further comprising receiving targeted advertising or marketing information based on previous or desired purchase transactions. In this way a vendor may nearly instantly know the relevant characteristics of nearby users and potential customers without knowing or learning the identity of such users so that the vendor may tailor product and service offerings specifically to the interests of nearby users and potential customers in real time without compromising the privacy anonymity of the users potential customers.

According to another aspect of another embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein is a system for providing electronic data privacy and anonymity. In one example the system may include at least one user device having a first privacy client operating on the user device at least one service provider device having a second privacy client operating on the service provider device and at least one privacy server coupled to the network the privacy server communicating with the first and second privacy clients wherein the privacy server includes an abstraction module that electronically links data attributes and attribute combinations and separates data attributes and attribute combinations and the abstraction module associates a DDID with the data attributes and or attribute combinations.

In one example the privacy server may include an authentication module that generates and or accepts one or more of said DDIDs. In another example the privacy server may include a maintenance module that stores a combination of the DDIDs with their associated data attributes and or attribute combinations. In another example the privacy server may include a verification module that verifies the integrity of data attributes attribute combinations and DDIDs.

In another example the privacy server may include an access log module that collects and stores information relating to the DDIDs and the data attributes for use in one or more post incident forensic analyses in the event of one or more errors.

In one example the DDID expires after a predetermined time and after expiration of the DDID the abstraction module assigns the DDID to another data attribute and or to another Data Subject.

Other embodiments of the disclosure are described herein. The features utilities and advantages of various embodiments of this disclosure will be apparent from the following more particular description of embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Disclosed herein are various systems methods and devices for private and secure management and use of information pertaining to one or more Data Subjects such as persons places or things and or associated actions activities processes and or traits. The systems methods and devices described herein abstract data attributes pertaining to Data Subjects and or associated actions activities processes and or traits by linking data pertaining to Data Subjects and or associated actions activities processes and or traits to independent attributes and or dependent attributes and separating elements pertaining to Data Subjects and or associated actions activities processes and or traits into independent attributes and or dependent attributes. DDIDs can then be associated with select data attributes or select attribute combinations thus creating TDRs. In this manner embodiments of the present invention can be utilized to provide data security privacy anonymity and accuracy for Data Subjects such as persons places or things and or associated actions activities processes and or traits. Various embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein.

Dynamic Anonymity is premised on the principle that static anonymity is an illusion and that the use of static identifiers is fundamentally flawed. The Dynamic Anonymity system dynamically segments and applies re assignable dynamic de identifiers DDIDs to data stream elements at various stages Note while dynamic segmentation may include time lapse it is more likely determined by activity location and or subject matter thereby minimizing the risk of information being unintentionally shared in transit in use or at rest while maintaining the ability of Trusted Parties and of no others to re stitch the data stream elements.

Cleartext primary keys may be used internally within a Circle of Trust CoT such as shown in to identify Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits however these keys may not be shared outside the Circle of Trust. Rather Dynamic Anonymity uses dynamically changing and re assignable compound keys outside of a Circle of Trust which may be comprised of i a DDID and ii the time period purpose for which the DDID is associated with a Data Subject action activity process and or trait . Information regarding this association may not be made available outside of the Circle of Trust and it may not be reconstructible if the DDID representing a connection with one or more Data Subject action activity process and or trait contains no recoverable information leading back to said one or more Data Subject action activity process or trait in each such case the connections would be severed and are not inherently computable .

Dynamic Anonymity enhances privacy anonymity and personal data protection capabilities in distributed platforms fragmented ecosystems while providing superior access to and use of data in accordance with policies established by or on behalf of Data Subjects. In this manner everyone including those who elect to use either closed or distributed systems benefits from enhanced data privacy and anonymity.

Dynamic Anonymity delivers certain immediate benefits without modification to existing business and technology practices. With the use of dynamically changing and temporally unique DDIDs current systems and processes e.g. web browsers and data analytic engines may not recognize relationships between and among data elements. These systems and processes can process information using existing capabilities without creating inferences correlations profiles or conclusions except as expressly authorized by Data Subjects and trusted parties proxies via a Circle of Trust CoT . However additional significant benefits would arise from new business and technology practices that leverage specific attributes and capabilities of DDIDs Dynamic Anonymity and or a Circle of Trust CoT .

At each point data is protected in accordance with PERMS specified by or on behalf of Data Subject s to whom that data pertains.

In applications where a static identifier would typically be associated with capture of data pertaining to a Data Subject Dynamic Anonymity can provide 

1. A dynamic de identifier or DDID that changes over time triggered by a lapse of time change in purpose temporary cessation in activity or change in virtual or physical location limiting the ability to track profile or otherwise associate data with a Data Subject action activity process and or trait.

2. An association from each DDID to the applicable one or more Data Subject action activity process and or trait stored and known only within the applicable Circle of Trust CoT .

3. Dynamic Anonymity also offers the optional ability to store data associated with DDIDs within a CoT.

A key feature of Dynamic Anonymity is the ability to anonymize and segregate data elements at the data element level rather than at the data record level i.e. at the level of individual data elements associated with a Data Subject action activity process and or trait rather than data elements representing the entirety or majority of information pertaining to a Data Subject action activity process and or trait. Circles of Trust retain relationship information between and among data elements and Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits to permit re association according to privacy anonymity policies and or rules established by and or on behalf of Data Subjects referred to sometimes herein as PERMS .

Consider a person who frequently uses a particular search engine. Currently the search engine assigns the person via their browser a cookie or other digital footprint tracker that persists for months or years against which an ever increasing stream of observational data e.g. search terms links clicked location data is then accumulated and very likely analyzed and further aggregated by multiple parties often revealing personally identifiable information without knowing consent by the Data Subject.

Dynamic Anonymity can leverage the natural response of a search engine to create a new cookie digital footprint tracker for each Data Subject perceived to be interacting with the search engine for the first time. Clearing history cache cookie digital footprint tracker and associated data will cause the search engine to generate a new cookie digital footprint tracker for the Data Subject. A Circle of Trust CoT can store information pertaining to associations of cookies digital footprint trackers to the Data Subject and optionally also store a list of queries and selected links.

With this approach the search engine would still have access to aggregate data trending search terms popular websites ad clicks etc. but would be prevented from drawing inferences related to the Data Subject based on observational data. If as authorized by privacy anonymity policies and or rules established by and or on behalf of the Data Subject the CoT could enable the search engine to perform more detailed analysis. This could be implemented using an HTTP proxy or browser extension requiring no modification to or cooperation from an existing search engine.

In the past anonymous tracking cookies were supposed to have solved the problem of how to support both privacy and analytics. However anonymous tracking cookies failed to achieve this goal because all the data was housed together and associated with random static identifiers that made it too easy to generate information that is linked or linkable to a Data Subject Personal Data or PD thereby nullifying or attenuating the value of the static anonymous identifiers. Dynamic Anonymity overcomes these shortcomings by employing dynamically changing and re assignable DDIDs storing the resulting DDID associations and obscuring keys within Circles of Trust and providing a unique interaction model enabling participation between and among Data Subjects and Trusted Parties third party participants.

A CoT is composed of one or more Trusted Parties each of which may offer one or more independent data storage facilities as well as secure means to segment and transmit sensitive data to these data stores.

Alternatively Dynamic Anonymity compliant application developers could choose to only store the Data Subject to DDID associations within the CoT and instead to use Dynamic Anonymity defined procedures to obscure encrypt and or segment data or utilize Dynamic Anonymity enabled toolkits for such procedures allowing applications to safely store generated or collected information in their own facilities without loss of context or business value.

Traditional techniques for data cleansing also referred to as data cleaning and data scrubbing paradoxically suffer from two different and antithetical kinds of problems.

1. A given data cleansing technique can simply be ineffective. Despite earnest efforts or even use of legally sanctioned techniques to obscure Personal Data it may be still possible to identify the Data Subjects and Personal Data from cleansed data. Three famous examples 

a. In the mid 1990s the Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission GIC released data on individual hospital visits by state employees in order to aid important research. Latanya Sweeney then an MIT graduate student purchased the Cambridge voter registration records and by linking the two data sets which individually were completely innocuous she was able to re identify then Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld s GIC entry despite the fact that it had been anonymized with all obvious identifiers such as name address and Social Security number removed.

b. In 2006 Arvind Narayanan then a graduate student at UT Austin together with his advisor showed that by linking the anonymized Netflix dataset to the Internet Movie Database IMDb in which viewers review movies often under their own names many Netflix users could be re identified.

c. In 2013 a team led by Dr. Yaniv Erlich of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research re identified men who had participated in the 1000 Genomes Project an international consortium to place in an open online database the sequenced genomes of as it turns out 2500 unidentified people who had also participated in a study of Mormon families in Utah.

2. More effective data cleansing techniques may reduce the business value of that data that is many obfuscation techniques are lossy.

The Dynamic Anonymity approach to data privacy anonymity provides a way to avoid both pitfalls simultaneously.

In order to protect Personal Data Dynamic Anonymity may employ a multiple means of measuring specifying and enforcing data privacy anonymity 

A Data Subject s PERMS may also be combined with or limited by statutory policies. For example medical data in the US must be protected in accordance with the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA. 

Additionally if allowed by the Trusted Party and with the data owner s consent offers to modify or grant specific and limited permissions may be presented to and accepted by Data Subjects.

Dynamic Anonymity may also improve upon existing frameworks by using privacy anonymity level determinations to prevent inappropriate use of data which is obscured and only analyzed whether from inside or outside a Circle of Trust in a manner consistent with each Data Subject s specified privacy anonymity levels.

A dynamic de identifier DDID is a temporally bounded pseudonym which both refers to and obscures the value of i a primary key referencing a Data Subject action activity process and or trait ii the value of an attribute of that Data Subject action activity process and or trait e.g. a ZIP code and or iii the kind or type of data being associated with the Data Subject action activity process and or trait e.g. the fact that some encoded value was a ZIP code .

DDIDs may additionally protect data if there is no discernable inherent nor computable relationship between their content and the values cleartext to which they refer. Additionally the association between any given DDID and its cleartext value may not be exposed outside the Circle of Trust CoT . Unlike static identifiers an obscured value or key need not have the same associated DDID when used in a different context for a different purpose or at a different time.

DDIDs can be either generated within the Circle of Trust or if the above criteria are satisfied external IDs can be used as DDIDs.

As mentioned DDID associations are temporally bounded by which we mean that even within the same context and with regard to a single type of data e.g. ZIP code a particular DDID may refer to one value at one time but may if desired also refer to another value at a different time.

This necessarily implies that in order to decode or expose the meaning of a particular DDID an application must also retain knowledge of the time to which that DDID applied.

This knowledge may be explicit that is the assignment time may also be part of the record or document in which the DDID was stored or it may be implicit for example an entire data set may have been obscured as a batch and presumed regardless of how long processing actually takes to have occupied the same instant and thus have only one consistent set of DDID mappings per field type. In order to reconstitute such data one would also need to supply some reference to the corresponding set of DDID value associations stored within the CoT .

Note that DDIDs are also bounded by context orpurpose meaning the same DDID can recur in multiple contexts even at the same time. For example consider a stream of records each of which contain a Social Security Number SSN and ZIP code and which all occupy a single time block. In such a case a particular DDID may be used both as a replacement for a ZIP code and also as a replacement for an SSN.

As above this implies that some indication of that context e.g. was this a ZIP code or SSN will be necessary to obtain the cleartext to which that DDID referred.

Consider the task of replacing a single stream of data the same kind of data e.g. ZIP codes or SSNs occupying the same time block with DDIDs. A Java like pseudocode description of an Application Programming Interface API that carries out such behavior in one potential embodiment of the invention might look like this 

In English interface means that we re defining a collection of functions named DDIDMap that operate on the same underlying data. Data types are here denoted with initial upper case letters e.g. DDID and variable or function parameter names are denoted with initial lower case letters e.g. the cleartext function parameter must be data of type Value where Value is just a stand in for any kind of data which can be obscured IDs quantities names ZIP codes etc. .

One function protect accepts some cleartext value and returns a corresponding DDID. If that value has been seen previously its previously assigned DDID will be returned. If it has not been encountered before a new DDID so far unique to this data set will be generated associated with that value and then returned.

The other function expose reverses this process when a DDID is passed to it it looks up and returns the cleartext value which was previously encoded as that DDID. If the given DDID has never been seen before it fails with an indication of error.

The data managed by these operations then is a two way mapping from each cleartext value to the DDID that replaced it and from the DDID back to the original value.

Note that although we ve said that a given DDID can only refer to a single value it is possible if desired to implement a variant version of this algorithm that allows a value to be associated with more than one DDID.

Recall that the above bidirectional DDID to value map operates i upon a single kind of data that is having the same type context and purpose and ii within the same time block. In order to support operations across multiple times and contexts we can posit another potential API which gives us the an appropriate DDID to value map for a given time and purpose 

Here context is or emits a key that refers to a particular kind of data being obscured. Elsewhere in this document sometimes also called the association key or A K . For example the context might be the name of the table and column in which data to be obscured will reside e.g. employee.salary . It could also include other non other chronological indications of purpose or scope.

The time parameter indicates the instant at which the DDID is being or was associated with its cleartext value. Since DDID to value maps span a block of time and there are many time instances within a block this implies there exists some function used internally within this API thus not shown above that finds the time block associated which each given time. More on this in a moment. 

Note that different kinds of data can employ different DDID replacement strategies. In addition to those mentioned in the next two sections DDIDs can vary in size whether they re universally unique or just unique to that data set or time block what kind of encoding they use e.g. integers or text etc. And although DDID generation should typically be random one might also wish to employ deterministic or pseudo random DDID generators for demonstration testing or debugging purposes.

One potential strategy may allow a particular DDID to be assigned to two different Data Subjects in the same context but during two different time blocks. For example within the same collection of time anchored records the DDID X3Q might at one moment in one time block refer to for example 80228 and later in another time block 12124 . We ll call this strategy DDID reuse. 

An alternative is to disallow such reuse and stipulate that a given DDID in the same context can only refer to a single Subject. Although the subject may still receive different DDIDs over time. 

The choice between these two strategies involves a tradeoff between increased obscurity and the ease with which one may perform aggregation queries on obscured data.

Imagine we wish to count patients per postal code. If postal codes DDIDs are unique we can aggregate counts per DDID and then ask the CoT to finish the query by resolving those DDIDs to their corresponding postal codes and aggregating again. But if we have reused DDIDs then we must send the entire list of DDIDs and corresponding times to the CoT for resolution and aggregation because we can t be sure that two instances of the same DDID refer to the same value.

Implementations also have freedom to choose different strategies for segmenting DDID maps by time. Blocks of time may vary by size and or time offset sizes can be fixed random or determined by number of records assigned per time. Note that employing an infinite sized time block for a given context gives behavior equivalent to using static identifiers. 

Although there may be many strategies for creating new DDIDs the API for generating such DDIDs may look essentially identical regardless of which strategy is implemented under the hood .

Next consider the task of determining what time block was associated with a given DDID assignment. Since a time block can contain many instances of time we ll need some kind of a time key sometimes abbreviated T K in elsewhere in this document to each time block. This implies the need for a function to obtain the appropriate key for any time instant 

Further note that both time blocking and DDID generation strategies depend upon the kind of data which are being obscured. In short they are both associated with a given context which includes or implies a notion of data type and usage meaning that the Context API must offer at least one function supporting each 

Given these two additional functions we can imagine that the implementation of getMap in DDIDManager shown previously may look something like this 

Here getExistingMap is some function that finds the map assigned to the given context and time key createMap creates a map which will use the given DDID factory and storeNewMap associates a newly created map with the context and time key by which it will be retrieved later. 

Dynamic Anonymity may define the following different kinds of data to be protected i primary keys which refer to Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits e.g. employee ID ii attribute data associated with but not unique to Data Subjects actions activities processes and or traits e.g. employee postal code and iii the indication of a disassociated obscured data element s type itself an association key or A K .

Each of these can be achieved by defining a different context first we ll discuss i and ii which are both achieved by obscuring data values replacing them with replacement key DDIDs abbreviated as R K elsewhere . We will address iii the indication of a disassociated obscured data element s type below.

Consider a trivial example an order table recording which customers bought products on a given day. Each record has a day number a customer ID and a product ID. We want to obscure this data for use or analysis by some third party who is outside the CoT. In particular we wish to obscure the customer and product IDs but leave the day numbers intact.

To do so we could create two Context instances one for Customer ID and one for Product ID . Although DDIDs should ideally be random for our purposes let s assume that our DDIDFactory will create integer DDIDs sequentially starting from 0. Further assume that each DDID map spans only three days so after three days a new set of DDID mappings will be used. This also implies that DDIDs will be reused the same DDID can refer to different values when used different blocks. This is not an ideal encoding strategy and is used here only for illustration purposes. 

To understand this you read down each column and think in groups of three days the first time block of DDIDs covers for each obscured field days 1 3 and the second covers 4 6 .

For the first three days customer ID is 500 600 600. The resulting encoding is 0 1 1 note that 600 is repeated so its DDID 1 is also repeated. 

For the second three days customer ID is 700 600 500. And starting over from 0 the result is 0 1 2 note that 500 was 0 before now it s 2 .

Another Context could be employed to obscure the indication of a disassociated obscured data element s type iii above where the column names are examples of Attribute Keys A K . This could be done using one DDID to value mapping for the whole set effectively substituting DDID for the column names or in time blocks as with the other fields in this example such that if an appropriately random DDID generation strategy were employed the affected records could not be analyzed without the assistance of the Circle of Trust.

The example APIs defined above presume that when data is encoded the encoding time is passed with each datum or record. This is only necessary when DDIDs are being reused within the same context and thus time is needed to discriminate between the two potential meanings of that DDID . When a DDID is only assigned to one value per context that DDID is sufficient to discover the single original value.

Time could also become an issue where reused DDIDs are being employed across different systems which might have slightly different notions of time. If it is not possible to pass the time associated with a DDID encoding a chronological buffer could be employed to prevent a DDID from being re used too close to it s original assignment. And when it is possible to pass the time associated with the data to be encoded the time could be sanity checked against the local system clock skew within a small window smaller than the DDID reuse buffer could be tolerated whereas larger differences would trigger an error report.

Finally note that there is also flexibility regarding where data is being encoded data could be streamed to a machine residing within the CoT and then sent along to its destination after encoding. But alternatively the encoding portions of the above algorithms could be run outside the Circle of Trust provided that the resulting DDID to value associations were a not stored on the local host and b safely e.g. using encryption and with appropriate safeguards against data loss streamed to a CoT host for persistence lowering latency in critical applications.

 De identification techniques traditionally used in certain circumstances e.g. HIPAA or health related circumstances to protect data privacy anonymity may be largely defensive in nature e.g. a series of masking steps is applied to direct identifiers e.g. name address and masking and or statistically based manipulations are applied to quasi identifiers e.g. age sex profession in order to reduce the likelihood of re identification by unauthorized third parties. This approach may result in a trade offs between protecting against re identification and retaining access to usable information.

Dynamic Anonymity may have significant offensive value in that the value of information can be retained and leveraged exploited for authorized purposes all with a statistically insignificant risk of re identification of any datum. Dynamic Anonymity may reject the proposition and traditional dichotomy that in order to minimize risk one must sacrifice the value of information content. Instead Dynamic Anonymity may minimize both risk and the amount of information lost enabling most if not all of it to be recovered but only upon authorization by the Data Subject Trusted Party not by unauthorized adversaries black hat hackers.

Dynamic Anonymity may uniquely enable information to be used in different ways by multiple parties in a controlled environment that facilitates unlocking and maximizing the value of data. Dynamic Anonymity may maximize the value of potential business intelligence research analysis and other processes while simultaneously significantly improving the quality and performance of data privacy anonymity processes.

When collected or stored sensitive data may be disassociated from its subject using one or more of the following strategies none of which incurs any loss in value 

The DDIDs associated with these operations are stored within a Circle of Trust CoT as shown in the original data may thus be reconstituted by reversing these transformations but only with the cooperation of the CoT itself and thus only when granted such permissions by and or on behalf of the Data Subject.

In one example embodiments of the invention may form a secure and comprehensive aggregated data profile of a Data Subject for use in one or more applications . A Data Subject or related party thereto e.g. user may anonymously communicate or selectively disclose the Data Subject s identity and or data attributes from the Data Subject s aggregated data profile comprised of data attributes attribute combinations or portions thereof potentially from unrelated data sources to vendors service providers advertisers or other entities with whom the Data Subject or related party is interested in communicating via a network for instance to possibly receive services or enter into a purchase transaction based on one or more of the Data Subject s characteristics as expressed in the Data Subject s aggregated data profile comprised of data attributes data attribute combinations or portions thereof potentially from unrelated data sources . In this manner embodiments of the invention provide for digital rights management for individuals DRMI referring to a Data Subject a related party or a third party managing data attributes and data attribute combinations pertaining to a Data Subject or digital rights management for de identification DRMD comprised of a third party managing data attributes and data attribute combinations associated with one or more Data Subjects. In one example the extent to which information regarding the data attributes data attribute combinations Data Subjects and or related parties may be made available to other parties may be controlled by embodiments of the present invention.

In the examples of and a plurality of users for example Data Subjects or service providers utilize devices such as smart devices e.g. wearable mobile or immobile smart devices smartphones tablets notebooks desktop computers wired or wireless devices or other computing devices running a privacy client application to access a network such as the Internet. As shown in and a system is illustrated which is coupled with and in communication with the Internet or other public or private network and the system may include a privacy server securely coupled with one or more databases . In one example the privacy server may be implemented using computer program modules code products or modules running on a server or other computing device. The one or more databases may be implemented using any conventional database technology including technology that securely stores data such as through encryption in redundant locations such as but not limited to RAID storage devices network attached storage or any other conventional databases.

In one example the privacy server implements one or more of the operations processes functions or process steps described herein and the privacy server may include or be configured to include other operations functions or process steps as desired depending upon the particular implementation of the invention including but not limited to the following processes operations or functions performed by the indicated modules 

An authentication module that may provide for both internal and external authentication including the following processes 

a. Internal authentication of privacy client requests for TDRs and privacy server generation of TDRs.

b. External authentication before allowing participation in desired actions activities or processes and use of TDRs to authenticate recipients as approved to receive Time Keys TKs Association Keys AKs and or Replacement Keys RKs as may be necessary to unlock contents of TDRs.

c. One example implementation of the authorization module may include allowing delegation of the ability to request generation of DDIDs and associated TDRs to other parties authorized by the controlling entity.

An abstraction module that may provide internal and external abstraction that may include one or more of the following processes 

a. Selecting DDIDs by means of generating unique DDIDs or accepting or modifying temporally unique dynamically changing values to serve as DDIDs.

b. Associating DDIDs with data attributes or attribute combinations to form TDRs for given Data Subjects actions activities processes or traits.

c. Including only a portion of relevant data attributes in TDRs thereby disassociating the data attributes pertaining to a Data Subject and or relevant for a given action activity process or trait.

Thereby allowing the TDRs to be later re associated with a particular attribute attribute combination action activity process trait and or associated Data Subject. In addition the maintenance module may perform further analysis and processing of attributes or attribute combinations in a secure environment.

An access log module that may include collecting and storing information to enable post incident forensic analysis in the event of system error and or misuse.

A verification module that may include validating and verifying the integrity of aggregated data profiles including data attributes attribute combinations DDIDs and TDRs at any point in time.

As described herein embodiments of the present invention are directed to promoting privacy anonymity security and accuracy in relation to electronic data and network communication analysis and or research. In one example data elements pertaining to Data Subjects actions activities processes or traits may be abstracted by linking data elements pertaining to the Data Subject action activity process or trait to independent attributes or dependent attributes and or separating data elements pertaining to the Data Subject action activity process or trait into independent attributes or dependent attributes. For purposes of this disclosure a data attribute may refer to any data element that can be used independently or in combination with other data elements to identify a Data Subject such as a person place or thing and or associated actions activities processes or traits.

As mentioned above in addition to abstracting data that may be used to identify Data Subjects such as a person place or thing the abstraction module of or may also be used to abstract data related to Data Subjects such as things which may include but are not limited to physical or virtual things and entities hardware or virtual devices software applications legal entities objects images audio or video information sensory information multimedia information geo location information privacy anonymity information security information electronic messaging information including senders and receivers message content hyperlinks in messages embedded content in messages and information relating to the devices and servers involved in sending and receiving the messages social media and electronic forums online websites and blogs RFID radio frequency identification tracking information tax information educational information identifiers related to military national defense or other government entity programs virtual reality information massively multiplayer online role playing games i.e. MMORPGs medical information biometric data behavior metric information genetic information data referring to the physical or virtual location of other data and instantiations or representations of data or information.

The systems methods and devices described herein may be used in one example to provide digital rights management for an individual DRMI and or digital rights management for de identification DRMD . Digital rights management for an individual may comprise individual directed privacy anonymity wherein a related party manages data attributes pertaining to one or more related parties. In this situation the related party would serve as the controlling entity. Alternatively a third party may manage data attributes pertaining to one or more related parties thereby comprising entity directed privacy anonymity. In this situation the third party would serve as the controlling entity. Digital rights management for de identification also comprises entity directed privacy anonymity wherein a third party manages data attributes associated with data attributes associated with related parties and controls the extent to which information regarding the data attributes and or related parties is made available to other parties.

The systems methods and devices disclosed herein may be used to provide DRMI such that one or more related parties directly or indirectly may manage their online digital fingerprint of data. The related parties may also control the extent to which information pertaining to data attributes Data Subjects or one or more related parties is made available to third parties such that the information and data may be made available in an anonymous non re identifiable manner. The systems methods and devices provide a dynamically changing environment in which related parties may want to share data at one moment but not at the next moment. This is done with the understanding that the time intervals specific receiving entities physical or virtual whereabouts or other mechanisms that trigger changes in the data to be shared may be dynamic in nature. Implementing DRMI enables non re identifiable anonymity and may allow for different information pertaining to data attributes Data Subjects and related parties to be shared for different purposes on a dynamically changing time and or place sensitive case by case basis. Particular needs with respect to information pertaining to data attributes Data Subjects or related parties at specific times and places may be accommodated without revealing additional unnecessary information unless such revealing is authorized by the controlling entity. Additional unnecessary information may be for example the true identity of the Data Subject or related party mailing addresses email addresses previous online actions or any other information not necessary for an unrelated party with respect to a specific action activity process or trait with respect to a Data Subject or related party.

The systems methods and devices disclosed herein may be used to provide DRMD such that entities may centrally manage the online digital fingerprint of information pertaining to data attributes Data Subjects and related parties for which they are responsible and such entities may control the extent to which information is made available to other parties in a non re identifiable versus identifiable manner. This allows the entity to satisfy de identification objectives and or obligations to comply with desires of Data Subjects related parties and regulatory protections and prohibitions.

Example implementations of some embodiments of the invention can be configured to provide DRMI and or DRMD capabilities with regard to data attributes comprised of images or video files revealing identifying facial characteristics are discussed below. A Data Subject or related party may benefit from others being able to make inferences about identity based on unique facial characteristics of the Data Subject in an electronic image. However the rapidly expanding commercial availability and use of facial recognition technologies combined with the growing availability of electronic images pose issues with regard to privacy anonymity and security of Data Subjects and related parties. In one example privacy anonymity and security can be safeguarded using one or more aspects of the present disclosures with respect to Data Subjects and related parties in the context of data attributes that are photos including facial images and characteristics of Data Subjects.

In some embodiments the systems methods and devices disclosed herein can be configured to distinguish between the status of parties as registered authorized versus nonregistered unauthorized visitors to a website or other electronic image sharing application containing a data attribute. A distinction may also be made between registered authorized visitors to a website or other photo sharing application containing data attributes pertaining to contacts friends of a Data Subject or related party versus not contacts friends of a Data Subject or related party depending on the status of a party. In one example a system of the present invention may control whether any image data attribute is presented containing facial features. If an image data attribute is presented containing facial features the system may further control and limit unauthorized use and copying of photos that can lead to unintended secondary uses through additional protection techniques. In addition some embodiments of the present invention may provide Data Subjects related parties and controlling entities with the ability to designate which additional parties and for which specific purposes the image data attribute may be presented at all. If the data attribute is presented the Data Subjects related parties or controlling entities may designate whether the image makes use of known protection techniques aimed at limiting unauthorized use and copying of photos thereby preventing or reducing the risk of unintended secondary uses of the image.

DRMI may enable Data Subjects and related parties directly or indirectly to manage photos containing facial images and control the extent to which photos pertaining to the related parties are made available to third parties in an identifiable non identifiable reproducible or non reproducible manner.

An example of a potential implementation of the present invention may involve use of DRMI by a provider of wearable implantable embeddable or otherwise connectable computing technology devices to mitigate potential public concern over information obtained and or processed using the technology device. For example GOOGLE could adopt DRMI to facilitate wider adoption of GOOGLE GLASS by establishing a do not digitally display list analogous to the do not call list maintained by the FTC to limit undesired solicitation calls to individuals that enables Data Subjects or related parties to register to prohibit the digital display of unauthorized photos taken using or displayed by GOOGLE GLASS . GOOGLE and GOOGLE GLASS are trademarks of Google Inc. 

DRMI provided by one example of the present invention may further provide a Data Subject or related party who is a member of the professional networking site LinkedIn.com with a feature to manage the extent to which photos are made available to third parties in an identifiable non identifiable reproducible or non reproducible manner. Access to use of and copying of photos containing facial images of a Data Subject or related party may be controlled using in one example a three tiered categorization schema 

Category A treatment or status may apply to visitors to the LinkedIn.com website who are not registered authorized members of LinkedIn.com. These visitors may be provided no means to view or copy photos containing facial images of registered authorized LinkedIn LinkedIn is a trademark of LinkedIn Corporation. members. Instead they may be served via their web browser mobile application or other application a graphic image indicator or avatar that indicates photos are available only to registered authorized users of the LinkedIn.com website.

Category B treatment or status may apply to registered authorized members of LinkedIn.com who are not authenticated contacts of a registered authorized member of LinkedIn.com. By using additional protection techniques aimed at limiting unauthorized use and copying of photos that can lead to unintended secondary uses these registered authorized members may be provided with limited means to view or copy photos containing facial images of LinkedIn member with regard to whom they are not an authenticated contact. These additional protection techniques may include but are not limited to 

Category C treatment or status may apply to registered authorized members of LinkedIn.com who are also authenticated contacts of another registered authorized member of LinkedIn.com. These registered authorized members may be provided with full means to view or copy photos containing facial images of the other LinkedIn member.

DRMD may be provided by some example of the present invention such that entities can centrally manage photo data attributes containing facial images for which they are responsible and can control the extent to which the photo data attributes are made available to other parties in an identifiable non identifiable reproducible or non reproducible manner.

One example of a potential implementation of the present invention may involve use of a system providing DRMD by a controlling entity that leverages known facial image recognition capabilities to limit disclosure of elements by parties who are not authorized by a Data Subject or related party of a photo data attribute which contains recognizable facial elements of said registered authorized Data Subject or related party to view the facial elements. Rather a party who tries to upload use or view a photo that includes facial elements of a registered authorized Data Subject or related party whose facial characteristics are registered with the DRMD system but which party has not been authorized by the registered authorized Data Subject or related party may see and be able to use only a modified version of the photo altered by the DRMD system to block out or de tag the recognizable facial elements of the registered authorized Data Subject or related party. For example a picture taken at a public bar that includes the face of a Data Subject or related party registered with a system providing DRMD may be modified to block out or de tag the face of the related party on all versions of the photo except those as explicitly authorized by the Data Subject or related party.

In one example of the present invention the authentication module can be configured so that decisions as to who sees what information are determined by a controlling entity on a configurable basis. In one example the configurable control may include automatic and or manual decisions and updates made on a timely case by case manner by providing each controlling entity with the ability to dynamically change the composition of information comprised of data attributes at any time. The enhanced customization achieved by dynamically changing the composition of data attributes leads to greater relevancy and accuracy of information offered pertaining to a data attribute and or related party. As disclosed herein use of DDIDs as a component of privacy anonymity and security enables each recipient entity receiving information to receive different information as appropriate for each particular purpose thereby fostering the distribution of fresh timely and highly relevant and accurate information as opposed to stale time burdened less accurate accretive data such as provided via conventional persistent or static identifiers or other mechanisms.

In one example a privacy client component of the present disclosure may be resident on a mobile device. The privacy client may be provided as part of a mobile application or operating system running on the mobile device or may be configured as a hardware device integrated circuit or chip of a mobile device. Mobile devices implementing one or more aspects of the present disclosure may possess real time knowledge of location activity and or behavior with respect to Data Subjects and or related parties pertaining to the device. The mobile device may also transmit receive and process information with other devices and information sources. Mobile applications interacting with the privacy client may provide the controlling entity with control over both the timing and level of participation in location and time sensitive applications and the degree to which information is shared with third parties in an anonymous rather than personally identifiable manner. Mobile devices implementing one or more aspects of the present disclosure may also leverage the unique capabilities of mobile devices to aggregate a user s personal preference information gathered from across a variety of unrelated and disparate sources whether they be mobile devices more traditional computer systems or a combination of both and only with the users approval share a user s information on an anonymous or personalized basis with vendors to facilitate time and or location sensitive personalized commercial opportunities. As may now be understood more clearly users may determine whether the benefits of such time and or location sensitive personalized commercial opportunities justify identifying themselves in connection with the transactions.

For example without embodiment of the invention static identifiers conventionally associated with a mobile device may enable mobile application providers and other third parties to aggregate information pertaining to use of the mobile device and by aggregating the data on use of the mobile device application providers and other third parties may obtain information which may include but not be limited to information related to the device user s frequent physical locations calling habits content preferences and online transactions that they could not obtain through data from any one time interaction with the device user. Through the use of some embodiments of the present invention application providers and other third parties would be prevented from aggregating information pertaining to use of a mobile device by Data Subjects and related parties and some embodiments of the present invention may be configured to provide a mobile device with use mobile applications requiring access to geolocation information e.g. direction or map applications without revealing the identity of the mobile device Data Subject or related party by means of dynamically created changeable and re assignable DDIDs described herein rather than conventional static identifiers.

In one example embodiments of the present invention may be configured to provide enhanced privacy anonymity security and accuracy over persistent and or static identifiers and by leveraging DDIDs rather than aggregate on a static identifier thereby embodiments of the present invention can provide a solution to online digital fingerprints being left across networks and internets. As a result embodiments of the present invention may provide a controlling entity with the ability to decide who sees what data prevent data aggregators from understanding data connections pertaining to a Data Subject or related party without the controlling entity s permission and provide control to the controlling entity over upstream and or downstream dissemination of information.

In one example of the present invention continued access may be provided for the benefits of big data analytics by using DDIDs to provide multiple protective levels of abstraction. Systems methods and devices embodying some aspects of the present invention also do not suffer from the fundamental flaws of Do Not Track and other initiatives that eliminate access to the data required for effective big data analytics and that are inconsistent with economic models offering free or discounted products or services in return for information. Do Not Track is a technology and policy proposal that enables Data Subjects or related parties to opt out of certain tracking by websites and third party data collecting entities as they are online including analytics services advertising networks and social platforms. Although Do Not Track provides Data Subjects and related parties with enhanced privacy anonymity and security it denies them the benefits of receiving customized personally relevant offerings while online through big data analytics. This impacts the economic benefits that big data analytics provides to merchants service providers and Data Subjects or related parties themselves.

In contrast some embodiments of the present invention may have a net neutral to positive revenue impact versus the net negative revenue impact of Do Not Track initiatives because with some embodiments of the present invention a controlling entity may include data attributes in TDRs that enable recipient entities to use existing tracking technology to track TDRs for the duration of their existence. The controlling entity may also include information that is more accurate than available via tracking alone to facilitate personalization and customization. For example a controlling entity may elect to include certain data with regard to past browsing sessions on a website in the attribute combinations pertaining to a Data Subject or related party that are sent via a privacy client to that website augmented with other specific more up to date information beneficial to both the website and the Data Subject or related party.

Referring to and one embodiment of the present invention may comprise a computer network in which one or more remote privacy clients comprised of computer hardware firmware or software resident on one or more computing devices or resident on and accessible via a network device send requests queries to and receive services responses from one or more computing devices that act as privacy servers . Privacy client computing devices may comprise smart devices i.e. wearable movable or immovable smart devices smartphones tablets notebook computers desktop computers or other computing devices with programs that i enable requests for services from and or submission of queries to privacy servers ii provide user interface capabilities iii provide application processing capabilities and or iv offer localized storage and memory. Privacy server computing devices may comprise large personal computers minicomputers mainframe computers or other computing devices with programs that i respond to requests for services queries from privacy clients ii provide centralized or decentralized administration of the system iii provide high volume application processing capabilities and or iv offer high volume storage and memory capabilities integrated with one or more databases. Privacy servers may also be configured to perform one or more of the operations or features described herein. Communications capabilities between and among privacy servers and privacy clients may be comprised of computer networks internets intranets public and private networks or communication channels and supporting technologies.

Referring to and another potential embodiment of the present invention may comprise a computer network in which one or more remote privacy clients comprised of computer hardware firmware or software resident on one or more computing devices or resident on and accessible via a network device send requests queries to and receive services responses from one or more computing devices that act as privacy servers wherein said privacy servers may transmit via the Internet internets intranets or other networks electronic information to cards mobile wearable and or other portable devices that may include means of electronically receiving and storing information wherein said cards mobile wearable and or other portable devices contain information pertaining to data attributes and or DDIDs until such time if any as said information pertaining to data attributes and or DDIDs is modified by said privacy servers.

The privacy servers and privacy clients may implement modules including program code that carry out one or more steps or operations of the processes and or features described herein. The program code may be stored on a computer readable medium accessible by a processor of the privacy server or privacy client. The computer readable medium may be volatile or non volatile and may be removable or non removable. The computer readable medium may be but is not limited to RAM ROM solid state memory technology Erasable Programmable ROM EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM EEPROM CD ROM DVD magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage other magnetic or optical storage devices or any other conventional storage technique or storage device.

Privacy servers and associated databases may store information pertaining to TDRs time periods stamps DDIDs attributes attribute combinations Data Subjects related parties associated profiles and other related information. Privacy servers and associated databases may be managed by and accessible to the controlling entity but in one example not by other parties unless authorized by the controlling entity. In one example an authentication module of one or more privacy servers controls access to data through the TDRs. Privacy clients may request information from privacy servers necessary to perform desired actions activities processes or traits and or query privacy servers whether TDRs are authorized to participate with respect to a requested action activity process or trait at a particular time and or place. Privacy clients may also aggregate data with respect to actions activities processes or traits in which TDRs associated with the privacy client engage such as tracking data obviating the need to return to the database for data extrapolation. Insights gleaned by other parties may become part of a TDR for its duration in one example.

In one example implementation of the invention the abstraction module is configured such that a controlling entity which may be the Data Subject or a related party links data pertaining to a Data Subject to attributes and or separates data pertaining to a Data Subject into attributes that can be divided combined rearranged or added into various attribute combinations. These combinations may contain any combination of attributes or previously created attribute combinations associated with the Data Subject.

In this example with regard to each intended action activity process or trait involving the privacy server the abstraction module in one example enables the controlling entity to limit the degree of identifying information transmitted or stored by selecting from among the attributes only those that are necessary with respect to a desired action activity process or trait and linking those data attributes to one or more attribute combinations and or separating those data attributes into one or more attribute combinations. The controlling entity may then use the abstraction module to dynamically create and or assign a DDID to form a TDR for each attribute combination. The DDID may be configured to expire after preset delays or cues and may be re used for data associated with another action activity process or trait and or other Data Subjects or related parties thereby leaving no precise trail of association outside of the privacy server. In one example before assigning or accepting a DDID to form a TDR the abstraction module may verify that the DDID is not actively being used in another TDR. In order to make this verification an additional buffer timeout period may be included to address potential outages and system down time. The greater the number of data attributes and associated TDRs generated with respect to a desired action activity process or trait the greater the privacy anonymity and security achieved. In this situation an unauthorized party gaining access to one of the TDRs would gain access to only that information contained in the TDR. In one example the information in a single TDR may be only a fraction of the attributes necessary with respect to the desired action activity process or trait and further does not provide the information necessary to determine other TDRs containing necessary attributes or to determine any Data Subjects and or related parties that may be associated with the TDRs.

In one example the creation of TDRs by means of the abstraction module may be based on one or more processes that match prescribed steps necessary to describe or perform different actions activities or processes with specified categories of attributes associated with the steps and selecting or combining those attributes necessary with respect to the particular action activity process or trait. The process of creating TDRs by means of the abstraction module may be performed directly by the controlling entity or indirectly by one or more parties authorized by the controlling entity.

For example a first database containing credit card purchasing information may include information necessary for a credit card issuer to conduct big data analytics on the purchasing information. However the database need not include identifying information for the users of the credit cards. Identifying information for the users of the credit cards could be represented in this first database by DDIDs and the Replacement Keys RKs necessary to associate the DDIDs with the users could be stored in a separate secure database accessible to a privacy server and or system modules. In this manner the system may help protect the identity of credit card users and limit potential financial loss in the event of unauthorized entry into the first database containing credit card purchasing information because the DDIDs and related information would not be decipherable to unauthorized parties.

In addition in one example of the present invention real time or batch analysis of data from mobile wearable portable devices can be performed in a manner that would be beneficial to receiving entities such as merchants or service providers without sacrificing the privacy anonymity of the users of the mobile wearable portable devices. Each user may be considered a related party to the mobile wearable portable device in question as well as the Data Subject associated with the device itself or use of the device. In return for special offers or other concessions proffered by receiving entities users of the mobile wearable portable devices could elect to have non identifying TDRs shared in an anonymous fashion based on the users real time location real time activities or during a particular temporal period e.g. with receiving entities that are located within a prescribed distance of a particular geographic location e.g. 1 mile 1000 feet 20 feet or other distance depending upon the implementation or within a prescribed category e.g. jewelry clothes restaurant bookstore or other establishment with respect to the location of the mobile wearable portable device. In this manner receiving entities could have an accurate aggregated view of the demographics of their potential customer base in terms of age gender income and other features. These demographics may be revealed by TDRs shared by the mobile wearable portable device users at different locations times of the day and days of the week that may help receiving parties more effectively determine what services desired inventory and other sales supply chain or inventory related activities to offer with regard to related parties. In one example Data Subjects and related parties which may be the users of the mobile wearable portable devices would benefit from special arrangements or offers without ever having to reveal their personal information to the receiving entities who would simply know that a Data Subject or related party was registered but would not know what specific information to associate with any particular Data Subject or related party unless and only to the extent desired by the Data Subject or related party.

In one example implementation of the invention the authorization module can provide the controlling entity with control over which other entities may be provided access to or use of TDR information. The controlling entity may further use the abstraction module to control the degree to which the other entities have access to specific elements of information contained in the system. For example a mobile wearable portable platform provider serving as the controlling entity may provide performance data to a mobile wearable portable device manufacturer without having to reveal the identity of the device Data Subject or related party user or location of the device Data Subject or related party user. The mobile wearable portable platform provider may also provide a mobile wearable portable application provider with geolocation data necessary for a mobile wearable portable device to use a mapping or other application without having to reveal the identity of the device Data Subject or related party user. Conversely the mobile wearable portable platform provider may use the system to provide an emergency 911 system with location and identity data pertaining to the device as well as the Data Subject or related party user of the device. One example implementation of the authorization module may include allowing delegation of the ability to request generation of DDIDs and associated TDRs to other parties authorized by the controlling entity.

According to one example implementation of the present invention receiving entities could use information regarding mobile wearable portable device related parties to customize user experiences or opportunities at locations where related parties gather without requiring that personal identifying information be revealed. For example a band that plays both country western and gospel music could in real time or near real time determine that the majority of related parties attending the concert preferred gospel music and adjust their song selection for the concert accordingly by receiving TDRs related to the Data Subjects or related parties that are concert attendees. Similarly in stores using video screens to display merchandise or special offers store management could know in real time when they have a large presence of customers of a particular demographic in the store by receiving and analyzing TDRs associated with Data Subjects or related parties that are customers from clients in mobile wearable portable devices. The store could then play videos targeted to that particular demographic and change the videos throughout the day in response to changes in the demographics of Data Subjects or related parties as communicated to the store system via clients in mobile wearable portable devices. The demographics obtained from information in the TDRs may include but are not limited to age gender or level income of Data Subjects or related parties. Similarly in retail stores using real time geolocation to identify a given customer s specific location in the store special discounts or offers could be made to a customer that is a Data Subject or related party via their mobile phone tablet or wearable device by receiving and analyzing TDRs associated with the Data Subject or related party s personal tastes brand preferences and product buying preferences where such TDRs would also include exogenous information added in real time based on the products available to that Data Subject or related party at the location in the store at which they are present.

In one example implementation of the invention the abstraction module of the privacy server assigns DDIDs to attribute combinations necessary to fulfill requests by and or queries from privacy clients that may reside in numerous locations including but not limited to on Data Subject devices on service provider devices accessible via and reside in a cloud network or reside on the same computing device as the privacy server thereby creating TDRs for the period of the association between the DDID and the desired attribute combinations. The TDR in a privacy client may interact freely with a recipient entity for the configured time action activity process or trait. Once a period of interaction with a designated recipient entity is completed the privacy client may in one example return the TDR augmented by attribute combinations pertinent to activity of the privacy client to the privacy servers and associated databases. The privacy server may then associate various attribute combinations back with particular Data Subjects as well as update and store the attribute combinations in the aggregated data profile for the Data Subject in the secure database s . At this time the DDID assigned to the attribute combinations may be reassigned with respect to other actions activities processes or traits or Data Subjects to continue obfuscation of data relationships in one example.

Other implementations of the invention are contemplated herein including various systems and devices. In one embodiment disclosed herein is a system for improving electronic data security. In one example the system may include an abstraction module configured to dynamically associate at least one attribute with at least one Data Subject an abstraction module configured to generate DDIDs or accept or modify temporally unique dynamically changing values to serve as DDIDs and further configured to associate DDID with the at least one Data Subject a maintenance module configured to track activity related to the DDIDs and configured to associate any additional DDIDs tracked activity and time periods during which a DDID is used for conducting the tracked activity by means of time keys TKs or otherwise. In one example the abstraction module is configured to add or delete attributes associated with the at least one Data Subject and the abstraction module may be configured to modify attributes already associated with the at least one Data Subject.

In another implementation disclosed herein is a device for conducting secure private anonymous activity over a network. In one example the device may include a processor configured to execute program modules wherein the program modules include at least a privacy client module a memory connected to the processor and a communication interface for receiving data over a network wherein the privacy client that may reside on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and reside in a cloud network or reside on the same computing device as the privacy server is configured to receive TDRs including DDIDs and associated data attributes necessary for conducting the activity over the network from a privacy server. In one example the privacy client may be further configured to capture activity conducted using the device and to relate the conducted activity to the TDRs. In another example the privacy client may be configured to transmit the captured activity and TDRs to the privacy server. The privacy client may reside on a mobile device as a mobile application in one example. The privacy client may reside in and be accessible via a network as a cloud based application in another example. The privacy client may reside on the same computing device s on which the privacy server s resides as a local application in another example.

In another example the device may also include a geolocation module wherein the TDRs are modified with information from the geolocation module and wherein the TDRs restrict access to information regarding the identity of the device. The device may also include a user interface configured to allow a user to modify the TDRs including options to change the DDID or data attributes associated with a particular TDR. The user interface may include selectable options for sharing the TDRs only with other network devices with a predetermined physical virtual or logical proximity to the mobile device.

In another example the device may receive in response to TDRs targeted advertising or marketing information based on the physical virtual or logical location of the device wherein the TDRs include demographic information related to a user of the device and further comprising receiving targeted advertising or marketing information based on demographic information. In another example the TDRs may include information related to purchase transactions made or desired to be made using the device and further comprising receiving targeted advertising or marketing information based on previous or desired purchase transactions.

In another implementation of the invention disclosed herein is a system for providing electronic data privacy and anonymity. In one example the system may include at least one user device having a first privacy client operating on the user device at least one service provider device having a second privacy client operating on the service provider device and at least one privacy server coupled to the network the privacy server communicating with the first and second privacy clients wherein the privacy server includes an abstraction module that electronically links Data Subjects to data attributes and attribute combinations and separates data into data attributes and attribute combinations and the abstraction module associates a DDID with the data attributes and attribute combinations. In one example the privacy server may include an authentication module that generates one or more of said DDIDs. In another example the privacy server may include a maintenance module that stores a combination of the DDIDs with their associated data attributes and attribute combinations. In another example the privacy server may include a verification module that verifies the integrity of data attributes attribute combinations and DDIDs. In another example the privacy server may include an access log module that collects and stores information relating to the DDIDs and the data attributes for use in one or more post incident forensic analysis in the event of an error. In one example the DDID expires after a predetermined time and after expiration of the DDID the abstraction module assigns the DDID to another data attribute or Data Subject.

As indicated in the system may be configured such that the assignment expiration and or recycling of any given DDID may occur based on any one or more of the following factors 1 change in the purpose for which a DDID and associated TDR was created e.g. association with a specific browsing sessions Data Subject transaction or other purpose 2 change in the physical location associated with a DDID and associated TDR e.g. upon exiting a physical location upon arrival at a general physical location upon arrival at a specific physical location upon entering a physical location or some other indicia of physical location 3 change in the virtual location associated with a DDID and associated TDR e.g. upon entering a virtual location upon changing a virtual location upon exiting a virtual location upon arrival at a specific page on a website upon arrival at a specific website or some other indicia of virtual location and or 4 based on temporal changes e.g. at randomized times at predetermined times at designated intervals or some other temporally based criteria. As may be appreciated DDIDs separate data from context because external to the system there is no discernable relationship between Pertinent Data the identity of a Data Subject or related party or Context Data associated with different DDIDs and or TDRs. Internal to the system relationship information is maintained for use as authorized by Data Subjects and trusted parties proxies.

It should be noted that there may be more than one Trusted Party working cooperatively in connection with a single Circle of Trust and that Data Subjects may be participants in any number of Circles of Trust. Circles of Trust can be implemented by means of a centralized or federated model for increased security. Arrows in represent data movement data inputs and outputs will contain different information.

As shown in the boxes labeled Privacy Policy and Authorization Request in data use may be managed by Users in accordance with permissions PERMs managed by trusted parties and or proxies. Users may be the Data Subjects themselves who are the subject of the data in question e.g. users consumers patients etc. with respect to their own data for purposes hereof Subject Users and or third parties who are not the subject of the data in question e.g. vendors merchants healthcare providers lawfully permitted governmental entities etc. for purposes hereof Non Subject Users .

PERMs relate to allowable operations such as what data can be used by whom for what purpose what time period etc. PERMS may also specify desired anonymization levels such as when where how to use DDIDs in the context of providing anonymity for the identity and or activities of a Data Subject when to use other privacy enhancing techniques in connection with or in lieu of DDIDs when to provide identifying information to facilitate transactions etc.

In a Data Subject implementation of the present invention e.g. DRMI Subject Users may establish customized PERMS for use of their data by means of pre set policies e.g. Gold Silver Bronze note that this is only an example and that mathematically this could be a discrete set of k choices or it could be represented by a value on a continuum between a lower and an upper bound that translate into fine grained dynamic permissions or alternatively could select a Custom option to specify more detailed dynamic parameters.

In a stewardship implementation of Dynamic Anonymity DRMD Non Subject Users may establish PERMs that enable data use access in compliance with applicable corporate legislative and or regulatory data use privacy anonymity requirements.

Within the CoT reflected in based on PERMS business intelligence data analysis and other processes may be performed by means of any combination or interpolation of I D T and or X with regard to one or more Data Subjects as shown in TABLE 3 below 

At each point in outside of the Circle of Trust and outside the smartphone itself the patient s data is protected no Personal Data PD is made available or ever produced.

In cases where data must be exposed externally that is outside the CoT Personal Data elements can be obscured or encoded as DDIDs with the resulting associations stored inside the CoT. Additionally when required the data or field type identifiers can also be obscured in a similar manner.

Later after analysis is performed the results of that analysis can then when permitted be associated back with the original Data Subjects field types and values.

Another way Dynamic Anonymity enables lossless analysis is through the use of federated anonymized queries either among different Trusted Parties within a CoT different data stores within the same Trusted Party or between Trusted Parties and application developers whose data stores reside outside the CoT.

Consider again the problem of choosing where to site a clinic to serve patients who are between 20 and 30 years old with STDs. The Dynamic Anonymity system improves upon existing techniques by allowing the target query to span multiple data stores and dividing it up such that each participant does not know what purpose it serves so there is no risk of divulging PD.

In this scenario the query for the number of patients who are 20 30 years old with STDs within a set of sufficiently large geographic areas is presented to numerous Trusted Parties within the Circle of Trust. This aggregate query is then broken down into several steps such as 

The actions needed to satisfy this query could span completely different data stores in different organizations nonetheless protected and facilitated by the Circle of Trust.

In this scenario companies operating healthcare related databases do not need to know or divulge the identity location or other potentially identifiable information of the patients whose data they possess. The records they possess are keyed by DDID and also potentially obscured so that no Personal Data is generated when performing the specified query nor when transmitting results.

Note that the party posing the query does not have access to this information. Their only interaction with the CoT consists of posing a question and receiving a high level aggregated non PD result. Note that not having access to this information in no way affects the quality accuracy or precision of the end result. Dynamic Anonymity thus eliminates Personal Data that contributes nothing to the end result and that only serves to weaken privacy anonymity without any attendant benefit to any other party. By filtering out irrelevant data the analysis of which would otherwise consume time and resources Dynamic Anonymity actually increases the utility and value of the information received.

Personal Data is only produced temporarily within the Circle of Trust managed by the Trusted Party the appropriate place for such information such as when the DDIDs are resolved. Such operations are transient and leave no lasting trace other than the intended query result and could also be confined to certain dedicated servers for increased security. The use of DDIDs in the context of Circles of Trust avoids potential shortcomings of normal data analytics that could generate discriminatory or even identifiable results.

Note that the following scenario assumes that both a Data Subject patient and his her physician have accounts inside the Circle of Trust.

At this point the image on the physician s screen is HIPAA protected PHI data. If the physician prints the data that paper will be subject to HIPAA. When the physician is done viewing the graph he she logs out or closes the browser the application ends and the data is erased.

Note that re identified HIPAA controlled data only resides in the physician s browser. The original blood pressure level data stored in the application provider s databases remains untouched and obscured. The Trusted Party s data remains unaffected as well.

Also note that the permission to view the blood pressure data is enforced within the Circle of Trust. It is not enforced as is common practice today merely by the viewer application or only by the application s backend servers. This means that an adversary could not gain unauthorized access to the data merely by hacking into the blood pressure level viewer application because the data would not be there in any usable or identifiable form. The dynamic data obscuring capabilities of Dynamic Anonymity DDIDs combined with the dynamic data privacy anonymity control capabilities of a Circle of Trust maximize both data privacy anonymity and value to support personalized medicine medical research.

With respect to the different nodes depicted in H A represent data elements related to two different Data Subjects that are capable of being tracked profiled and or analyzed by third parties because they can be associated with and or re identified for each of the Data Subjects. H B represents a simplified visual depiction of the same data elements that can be retained with Dynamic Anonymity without loss of context. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA is a federal privacy statute that regulates access to and disclosure of a student s educational records that disclose personally identifiable information PII . FERPA provides that PII cannot be disclosed however if PII is removed from a record then the student becomes anonymous privacy is protected and the resulting de identified data can be disclosed. In addition to statutorily defined categories e.g. name address social security number mother s maiden name etc. FERPA defines PII to also include . . . other information that alone or in combination is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances to identify the student with reasonable certainty. The ability of Dynamic Anonymity to obfuscate connections between each of the Data Subjects and the data elements in a controlled manner by means of an Anonos enabled Circle of Trust CoT as visually depicted in H B enables educational related data to be used without disclosing PII.

AMS may be used to correlate mathematically derived levels of certainty pertaining to the likelihood that personally sensitive and or identifying information may be discernible by third parties to tiered levels and or categories of anonymity. In other words AMS values may be used to evaluate the output from Disassociation Replacement activities to determine the level type of consent required before data can be used.

In Step of data attributes may be evaluated to assess DLDs i.e. data elements are analyzed to determine the potential likelihood of directly or indirectly revealing personal sensitive identifying or other information with regard to which anonymity protection is desired. In Step based at least in part on the determined DLDs the data elements may be dynamically anonymized by means of Disassociation. In addition data elements may also undergo Replacement. In Step a calculation may be performed e.g. by means of a mathematical function algorithm e.g. the mathematical function algorithm whose output is reflected in to calculate an AMS that correlates to the likelihood that the identity of the Data Subject to which said data attributes pertain may be discernible by third parties after Disassociation Replacement with DDIDs. Finally in Step the score rating calculated in Step above may be used to specify the level of consent involvement required by the Data Subject to which the anonymized data attributes pertain versus what level of discretion use a third party may exercise with regard to the anonymized data attributes without requiring consent involvement by the Data Subject such as is shown in the example AMS usage reflected in below.

Different categories of information hold different statistical likelihoods of being re identifiable. Every data element has associated with it with an inherent level of uniqueness as well as a level of uniqueness when combined with other pieces of data as determined by placement order and or frequency of occurrence. For instance looking at single data points a social security number is highly unique and therefore more easily re identifiable than a single data point such as sex since each person has an approximate 1 1 probability of being male or female. Since gender is less unique as an identifier than a social security number gender is significantly less likely on an independent basis to re identify someone than a social security number.

The Anonymity Measurement Score AMS measurement schema ties statistical probabilities of re identification to create multiple ratings depending on the level and degree of disassociation and or replacement applied to data elements. As a single data point example a social security number which has not been disassociated or replaced at all may merit an AMS rating of 100 meaning the uniqueness classifies it as a very high risk of re identification. Whereas sex as a single data point identifier without disassociation or replacement may merit an AMS score of 10 since it is classified at a low risk of re identification even without de identification measures in place.

In an example implementation with a social security number as a singular data point a Level 1 implementation could assign DDIDs for purposes of disassociation and or replacement while retaining the initially assigned value i.e. permanent assignment e.g. where data is used as output in hard copy representations of the data . In the case of a social security number a Level 1 application of DDIDs could reduce the AMS score by 10 and result in a modified AMS score of 90. This is still a high level of risk associated with re identification but is more secure than non disassociated and or replaced elements.

In an example Level 2 implementation the social security number could have DDIDs assigned for purposes of disassociation and or replacement while retaining the initially assigned value until the value is changed on a one directional basis i.e. ad hoc changeability e.g. where data values can be changed unilaterally by sending new information to remote cards mobile wearable and or other portable devices that include means of electronically receiving and storing information . The social security number AMS score could thereby be reduced another 10 to achieve an AMS score of AMS.

In this example continuing to a Level 3 implementation it could have DDIDs assigned for purposes of disassociation and or replacement whiled retaining the initially assigned value but the DDIDs could change on a bi directional basis i.e. dynamic changeability e.g. where data values can be changed bilaterally by sending and or receiving data dynamically between client server and or cloud enterprise devices with the ability to receive and change specified data dynamically . The social security number would then have an AMS score that is further reduced by 50 resulting in an AMS score of 40.5.

As de identification measures are applied to a data point through disassociation and or replacement via use of DDIDs the risk of re identification is lowered. AMS score determinations are derived from the function of the likelihood of an identifier or identifiers taken together to be re identifiable. This combined with the processes used to obfuscate data elements can then be separated into categorical or other types of classification schemas to determine various functions such as permitted uses and what level of permission entities need to have before using data. This process may also be applied to single or aggregated AMS scores. Aggregated AMS scores are the likelihood of multi data point re identification expressed through AMS scores as compounded together to express the level of uniqueness of combined data points.

As an example of a possible categorical classification schema the AMS score could be broken into Categories A B and C. Where category A is data with a single or aggregated score of 75 or more may be used only with current express and unambiguous consent of the Data Subject. Category B may represent a single or aggregated AMS score of 40 to 74.9 that would mean the data set could be used with i current or ii prior express consent of the Data Subject. A Category C could represent a single or aggregated AMS score of 39.9 or lower which could allow for use of the data set without requiring consent of the Data Subject.

In the example disclosed in each of the identifiers other than the Social Security Number discussed above i.e. Credit Card Number First Name Last Name Birthdate Age and Sex are similarly assigned a Non Disassociated Replaced AMS rating in the first column. In each of the next two subsequent columns i.e. Level 1 and Level 2 their AMS scores are adjusted by successive 10 reductions and in the last columns i.e. Level 3 their AMS scores are adjusted by a 50 reduction resulting in decreasing AMS scores as DDID enabled obfuscation increases by means of permanent assignment Level 1 ad hoc changeability Level 2 and dynamic changeability Level 3 .

As mentioned above illustrates exemplary calculated Anonymity Measurement Scores in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. These AMSs are for illustration purposes only and demonstrate the fact that certain types of potentially personally identifying information is more likely to reveal a Data Subject s true identity than other types of information and that additional levels of Disassociation Replacement e.g. ad hoc i.e. Level 2 and or variable changeability i.e. Level 3 may increase the amount of anonymity afforded to the Data Subject by the anonymization systems and scheme.

As mentioned above illustrates exemplary categories for the level of consent involvement required by the Data Subject for certain calculated Anonymity Measurement Scores in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. These categorizations are given for illustration purposes only and demonstrate the fact that certain aggregated scores may apply different categories of treatment. For example Category A data may be used only with current express and unambiguous consent of the Data Subject while Category B data may be used with current or prior express consent of the Data Subject and Category C data may be used without requiring consent of the Data Subject. Other schemes may be employed to meet the needs of a particular implementation.

In the example embodiment reflected in data is resident in an emergency response database in a dynamic DDID obfuscated state such that identifying information is not discernable or re identifiable until such time as necessary association keys AKs and or replacement keys RKs are provided when an appropriate triggering incident occurs. A triggering operation carried out by a trusted party would issue time sensitive AKs RKs with respect to portions of appropriate data at specified levels of obfuscation or transparency depending on the type of incident. Identifying information could be maintained inside the emergency response database but in a dynamic DDID obfuscated state a data mapping engine controlled by a trusted party would maintain correlative information pertaining to dynamically changing DDIDs and AKs RKs necessary to discern and or re identify data which would only be provided upon the event of an appropriate emergency incident.

Policy external to the system would determine which information may be relevant for different incidents and stages of incidents as well as what level of obfuscation transparency is appropriate at different times so not all information would released at once and so that irrelevant but sensitive information would not released without cause. These permissions would then be encoded for ease of triggering access in an emergency. This method allows for bidirectional communication with and verification of the locations of impacted individuals compare to capabilities of static lists or unidirectional communication.

AKs RKs would be changed and reintroduced to the emergency response database after each incident so that information would be maintained on an ongoing electronic basis in a DDID obfuscated state i.e. a new trigger would be required to make portions of data readable via new AKs RKs following a prior release of AKs RKs in response to an earlier incident i.e. following resolution of an emergency response incident AKs RKs previously provided would no longer reveal the underlying identifying information associated with dynamically changing DDIDs. This would protect the privacy anonymity of individual citizens while protecting their safety in major incidents by allowing appropriate access to data for a limited period of time. On the emergency management side this could reduce the need for resource intensive information intake and handling procedures employed during large incidents.

Additionally new data pertaining to individuals could be added during incidents such as accounted for or missing status designation during evacuation. This new input could become part of an individual s personal profile held in stasis by an embodiment of the present invention and maintained for future authorized use if helpful in the same or subsequent emergency.

In a local opt in example citizens could register to have information that would be relevant in an emergency stored in a DDID obfuscated emergency database. The emergency database could be stored locally or elsewhere but could be interoperable in case of cross jurisdictional incidents. Once the citizen data is input into the DDID obfuscated system no one could see or access the data in a discernable or re identifiable manner until a trigger mechanism controlled by a trusted party results in release of dynamic situational based AKs RKs as necessary to discern re identify appropriate components of the stored data.

Two examples of emergency management views of potential embodiments of the present invention could include 

The above two variations in format could be interoperable as well with the data from each being represented in the other either interactively or linked.

In the case of watches and warnings the locality of the weather phenomenon as determined via weather radars GIS mapping etc. will determine the subset of information released which may be further revealed inside the database.

In another example case there may be a criminal who is profiling a particular demographic as targets. In this situation DDIDs such as contact and demographic information would be relevant in addition to partially obfuscated location data in order to create general perimeters on the message send out. The relevant data fields and their DDIDs would be activated to point to individuals matching the demographic who may then be put on notice of the criminal activity.

In an emergency situation that requires evacuation this information could be triggered to assist emergency personnel in more effective resource deployment in addition to assisting in evacuation or identifying those who may need additional assistance in emergency situations. In another example such as a blizzard the system could be triggered to let emergency personnel know exactly where kidney dialysis patients are located in their city for emergency transportation via snowplow by means of GPS location information associated with mobile devices associated with the patients which information would be represented by indiscernible non re identifiable DDIDs until such time as a trigger event results in the release applicable AKs RKs reflecting appropriate correlative information.

The terms Just In Time Identity and or JITI are used herein to refer to the dynamic anonymity methods and systems described herein. The term JITI keys or the term keys are used herein to refer to the terms Association Keys Replacement Keys Time Keys AKs RKs TKs and or keys as used herein.

The methods and systems for general purpose granular contextual programmatic protection of data disclosed in this section shift the focus away from who has access to data since without Anonos Just In Time Identity JITI keys the data is unintelligible and refocus that attention toward who has access to the JITI keys and the scope of use enabled by each JITI key.

By technologically and programmatically enforcing data protection data security privacy and or anonymity policies in a contextually flexible selective manner all the way down to lower data element levels or even to the individual data element level JITI maximizes authorized use of data while minimizing unauthorized use of data. JITI facilitates compliance with and audibility against established data protection policies by enabling the mathematical statistical and or actuarial measurement and monitoring of data use. JITI enables the same data store s to simultaneously programmatically support data protection policies applicable to multiple companies states regions countries industries etc. and to adjust in real time to changing requirements of said policies by dynamically modifying the intelligible form of data into which DDIDs are transformed.

With JITI data down to the smallest desired data element level e.g. down to the individual datum level is dynamically obscured by replacing the data with Dynamic De Identifiers DDIDs as more fully described herein. For example rather than storing a person s actual name that person s name can be replaced by a DDID. Importantly JITI replaces data elements at the data layer rather than masking data at the presentation layer. By dynamically obscuring data down to the element level at the data layer by replacing data elements with DDIDs and further by dissociating relationships between data elements it becomes extremely hard to track profile infer deduce analyze or otherwise to directly or indirectly understand or correlate data without access to JITI key s necessary to transform DDIDs into an intelligible form. For purposes of this application transform means without limitation correct shorten compress encode replace render compute translate encrypt decrypt substitute exchange or otherwise perform mathematically functional or cognizable operations upon the DDIDs whether by mechanical physical electronic quantum or other means.

Turning back to the spheres on the left side of represent data elements with respect to which metadata i.e. data that provides information about other data reveals interrelationships between and among the top three spheres representing data elements and between and among the bottom four spheres representing data elements thereby enabling tracking profiling inferences deduction analysis understanding and correlations represented by the dotted lines between and among the spheres on the left side of . On the right side of the different design on each of the spheres represents a unique dynamic de identifier DDID used to replace the data element represented by the sphere. As a result of using different DDIDs no metadata can exist or relate to any of the spheres on the right side of to indicate any interrelationship between or among any of the spheres representing data elements. Without access to JITI key s necessary to transform DDIDs into an intelligible form the replacement of data elements with DDIDs significantly increases the difficulty of successful attempts at tracking profiling inference deduction analysis understanding or establishing correlations between or among any of the spheres representing data elements.

Granular contextual programmatic enforcement on the front end makes it easier to audit compliance with data protection e.g. security privacy and or anonymity policies on the back end thereby increasing the accountability and trust necessary for the wide scale domestic and international acceptance of data analysis and use that maximizes the value of data while improving protection for that same data. The same data may be subject to different jurisdictional requirements based on the source and or use of the data. For example data representing a heart rate reading e.g. 55 beats per minute may be subject to different data protection policies depending on how the data is captured.

For example if the data is captured by means of a personal health device in the U.S. use of the data may be subject only to terms and conditions of the device and or application used to capture the information. If the data is captured in connection with providing healthcare services in the U.S. use of the data may be subject to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and applicable state laws. If the data is captured in connection with federally funded research in the U.S. use of the data may be subject to the Common Rule as codified e.g. in 7 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations CFR Part 1c by the Department of Agriculture 10 CFR Part 745 by the Department of Energy 14 CFR Part 1230 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 15 CFR Part 27 by the Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology 16 CFR Part 1028 by the Consumer Product Safety Commission 22 CFR Part 225 by the Agency for International Development USAID 24 CFR Part 60 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development 28 CFR Part 46 by the Department of Justice National Institute of Justice 32 CFR Part 219 by the Department of Defense 34 CFR Part 97 by the Department of Education 38 CFR Part 16 by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Research Oversight Office of Research and Development 40 CFR Part 26 by the Environmental Protection Agency Research and Development 45 CFR Part 46 by Department of Health and Human Services also applicable to the Central Intelligence Agency the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration 45 CFR Part 690 by the National Science Foundation and 49 CFR Part 11 by the Department of Transportation. As a result scalable programmatic general purpose data protection and compliance technology solutions such as JITI may be needed for among other reasons accommodating jurisdiction of disparate data protection policies of different business industry government regulator and or other stakeholder group s .

Possible implementations of methods and systems for granular contextual programmatic enforcement of data protection polices disclosed herein include in one preferred embodiment real time de identification and anonymity solutions and or services that help to address concerns over unintended access to and use of data in violation of data security and privacy policies thereby overcoming the limitations of other approaches to protecting data. In contrast other approaches for protecting data e.g. improving security privacy and or anonymity of data are generally binary either data protection is facilitated at the sacrifice of data value or data value is facilitated at the sacrifice of data protection. For example efforts to improve data security by encrypting data result in data being protected but unusable in its protected form or conversely in the data s becoming vulnerable when it is decrypted for the very purpose of enabling use.

It should also be mentioned that JITI based techniques do not have to be used in lieu of other known techniques for data protection i.e. security and privacy . In fact JITI can be used in conjunction with such other techniques. A primary benefit of using JITI to render data into DDIDs is that if and when other approaches fail then the exposed data will be have neither value nor meaning without access to JITI key s necessary to render DDIDs into intelligible form.

Granular contextual programmatic enforcement of data protection e.g. data security privacy and or anonymity policies with JITI supports the statistical assessment of the probability that a data breach and or data re identification will occur or of the rank ordering of such incidents i.e. non parametric methods . JITI is more efficient from an information theory perspective than other approaches to protecting data because the value of the data is still accessible but the identifying information is not. In other words the identifying information has no leakage meaning zero information is leaked while the value of the data is safely and intentionally leaked in a positive way which may itself be subjected to standard information theoretic optimizations meaning the value is made available to those who are authorized users.

The granular contextual programmatic structure of JITI supports a mathematical proof of the significantly reduced probability of a data breach or re identification. An example of a mathematical proof of JITI s effectiveness is an analysis by a data scientist concluding that data which has been replaced with DDIDs down to the data element level a process referred to herein as Anonosizing the data results in no greater probability of re identification than guessing the identity of highly encrypted data. However unlike encrypted and other non Anonosized data Anonosized data can be used in its protected form to generate value from the data. In addition a different DDIDs can be assigned to the same data element s at different times and or different places and or different purposes and or according to other criteria thus making it extremely difficult for parties not in possession of JITI keys to track profile infer deduce analyze or otherwise understand protected data and b the same DDID s if expired for any reason can be but are never required to be assigned to different data elements also at different times and or different places and or different purposes and or according to other criteria thus making it extremely difficult for interloping parties or other bad actors ever to establish any meaningful continuity or audit trail since these reassigned DDIDs would refer to data elements that bore no meaningful relationship correlative or otherwise to any and all data elements to which they had been assigned. Refer back to for criteria that may trigger assignment application expiration and recycling of DDIDs and or JITI keys.

JITI s granular contextual programmatic enforcement of data protection policies severely depreciates the Mosaic Effect defined to mean that even if data is not identifiable by itself the data poses a privacy or security risk when combined with other data. For example Harvard University Professor in Residence of Government and Technology Latanya Sweeney is credited with disclosing that knowledge of only three discrete identifiers 1 zip code 2 gender and 3 date of birth can result in 87 i.e. 216 million of 248 million then U.S. citizens of the U.S. population being personally re identified. However for this to be true a zip code gender and date of birth must be known to apply to the same person. Using JITI the owner of these data elements can be obscured by associating each data element with a different or dynamically changing DDID rather than associating all three with the same static identifier. With JITI it would be extremely difficult to know whether a zip code gender or birth date applied to one person or to multiple people thereby severely depreciating the Mosaic Effect. 

One potential implementation of the methods and systems for granular contextual programmatic protection of data disclosed herein would involve the development of mathematical statistical actuarial models to reduce insurance risks. Granular contextually driven programmatic protection of data as disclosed herein enables mathematical measurement of compliance as required to develop algorithms that better assess price and insure against risk. By ensuring protection of data security privacy and or anonymity at the individual consumer level it becomes more acceptable to aggregate larger amounts of data on a broad more population representative basis one which can improve the accuracy and value of risk related data.

A further potential embodiment of the methods and systems for granular contextual programmatic protection of data disclosed herein is prior to rendering the DDIDs requiring use of multiple JITI keys to ensure the consent of multiple relevant parties. Requiring multiple JITI keys i.e. an n of m model in which all available key fragments or a specified percentage of available key fragments is required to unlock data values from DDIDs can ensure that interests of various stakeholders in a multi stakeholder or highly sensitive data access disclosure situation are respected by requiring that the JITI keys held by each of the interested stakeholders be used to trigger the simultaneous renderings of DDIDs into intelligible forms.

An additional potential embodiment of the methods and systems for granular contextual programmatic protection of data disclosed herein is to encapsulate highly granular to a ratio as low as 1 1 for JITI key triggers to data elements although this should not be construed to limit many to one one to many or many to many mappings between JITI key triggers and data elements as such embodiments are also envisioned access rules setting forth without limitation and among multiple potential parameters any some or all of the degree context specificity abstraction language and accuracy into which DDIDs are authorized to be transformed. In this embodiment access rules may be encoded into one or more JITI keys that are programmatically enforced to ensure that DDIDs are unlocked and their original contents revealed but only when all the explicit access rules are observed and enforced. JITI provides support for multiple and or cascading policies embodied in assigned JITI keys by enabling an override such that when more than one policy applies only the most restrictive applicable policy will be enforced or alternatively the union of the most restrictive policies could be combined to create a new maximum restricted policy statically or dynamically and in any of batch near time and real time scenarios.

Different JITI keys can unlock different views of the same DDID or its underlying value thereby providing granular control over the level of detail or obfuscation visible to each user based on the context of said user s authorized use of data e.g. authorized purpose s place s time s or other attributes of use . For purposes of this application unlock means decode translate unveil make visible permanently or ephemerally or provide a unique slice consisting of a subset of a larger set of data where such slice can contain no data elements a single data element or any combination of any number of data elements. The rendering of DDIDs into intelligible form by JITI keys is triggered by the existence of prescribed JITI key trigger factors e.g. purpose place time and or other designated trigger factors that are used alone or in combination with other trigger factors so that DDIDs including obfuscated ones are rendered in different ways for different users and or different times and or in different places and or on other attributes of use all based on satisfying JITI key trigger factors. As mentioned above describes various exemplary events that may trigger the assignment application expiration and recycling of DDIDs with respect to data elements e.g. data attributes and or attribute combinations and or JITI keys to occur.

Another example embodiment of the present invention relates to medical services. In this example embodiment the cleartext value of 55 heartbeats per minute BPM is replaced with a DDID having the value of ABCD. Note that solely for the purposes of simplifying exposition the example DDIDs provided in this application are often presented as being a few characters in length but in an actual embodiment these DDIDs may be of any finite length. The DDID used in this potential example ABCD is programmed to be rendered as its unaltered original value of 55 BPM only by those JITI keys for which the said key holders satisfy all of the following applicable requirements by applicable it is meant that JITI key access may be based on one some or all of the attributes set forth below 

a. Authentication of the identity of the key holder e.g. by means of a password multi factor authentication or any other authentication process and or

b. Authorization for the individual key holder to view the JITI key authorized data e.g. by comparing the authenticated identity of the key holder to the identities of medical personnel assigned to care for the patient or indirect authorization for said key holder by means of inheritance of attributes e.g. from a set collection group class or other structure of any size to which the individual belongs enabling JITI enabled access to the source data.

a. A physical location relevant to providing care to or for the patient e.g. within a specified distance from the patient s room and or from a medical station on the same floor as the patient s room and or

b. A physical location pertaining to authenticated authorized persons e.g. within a specified distance from a mobile phone device and or sensor that is intended to be kept on the person of each authenticated and authorized nurse .

3. Temporally Time Based Verification of permissible time periods e.g. by comparing then current time to the times when the key holder is scheduled to be providing care to the patient .

The following description is neither inclusive of all possible considerations nor intended to define a minimum or maximum scope. For example while the following description uses traditional tabular database structures it is only a single example and a single embodiment of an implementation. JITI could be implemented using NoSQL and or other approaches including without limitation emerging technologies such as quantum databases quantum relational databases graph databases triple stores RDF or S3DB as a means to represent data on the Semantic Web without the rigidness of relational XML schema .

Further any of such approaches and or databases may be used to support implement and or be integral to the creation implementation and or deployment of a Privacy Client and or a Privacy Server which are themselves used to support an implementation of JITI or any other aspect of the inventions set forth herein or in letters patent or patent applications in the same family. Either or both of the Privacy Client and Privacy Server may be integrated with controlled by and or populated with data by a client side application where such application may in certain embodiments i run on siloed computer equipment not connected to the Internet ii run on mobile devices connected directly or indirectly to the Internet including devices on the Internet of Things iii run directly as an application or through an application that itself runs on any standard Internet browser e.g. Chrome Internet Explorer Microsoft Edge Firefox Opera Safari native Android browsers etc. and or iv utilize components and services commonly associated with or that are part of the Semantic Web. Similarly the various queries and record create modify events described below are not intended in any way to limit embodiments to Relational Database Management System RDBMS type designs such language is used only to simplify the characterizations of the types of actions performed.

An embodiment of the present invention involving DDIDs and JITI keys as described herein might include at a minimum an implementation whereby a Privacy Client and at a maximum both the Privacy Client and the Privacy Server including as many instances of such Clients and Servers equal in number respectively to one or greater would reside on the client side e.g. as part of an application running in the browser on virtual physical or logical computing devices of any kind described herein on which a Privacy Client can run and where such devices or applications running thereon interact directly or indirectly with such a browser . One such potential implementation using DDIDs and JITI keys could harness capabilities of the Semantic Web the extension of the Web through standards established by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C like the Resource Description Framework or RDF as a unifying computational environment.

Unlike a traditional DB no raw data may be stored in the Main DB of a JITI enabled system i.e. only DDID data may be stored . There may instead be two databases a Main DB with DDID data and a JITI DB which contains keys that decrypt the Main DB on a cell by cell basis. Each new value in the Main DB is in this example assigned a unique DDID value 8 characters long wherein each character is a member of the character class a z A Z 0 9. Such syntax and structural constraints are arbitrary and could be reconfigured to suit any particular deployment or policy goal including defining a DDID syntax to comply with the original syntax requirement of the source data field type while still inserting random values with no greater chance of re identification than would be possible via guessing. In total there are 62 possible values per character 26 lower case alpha 26 upper case alpha 10 numeric . There are thus 62 8 approximately 2.1834 10 4 possible values and this range can increase significantly by adding additional characters to achieve higher entropy . This could easily be changed to BASE64 or some other encoding in the future this choice is just for aesthetic value in this example embodiment.

In one embodiment the underlying value of every DDID in the Main DB may also be assigned a new unique 8 char DDID. For convenience s sake to distinguish the underlying value of a DDID from the DDID itself we will call the underlying value of the DDID the DVAL. For simplicity a random 8 char DVAL is sufficient provided it is subjected to a uniqueness check. For future use random generation might not be adequate for very large data sets trillions of records . Sequential values such as aaaaaaaa aaaaaaab are not used because sequential unique ID s can be used to launch an inference attack if the ordering of the original raw table is known such as during a database import .

In one embodiment each raw value will be encrypted using AES which produces a unique ciphertext even for the same plaintext due to different initialization vectors. For example TABLE 4 below give a set of exemplary original values.

The DVAL s for the values shown in TABLE 4 might with random generation be the values shown in TABLE 5 below.

In order to re associate each DVAL with its original value each DVAL may be written to the DVAL Table with its encrypted ciphertext and an Initialization Vector IV as is shown in TABLE 6 below which was AES encrypted using a secret key of for demo purposes only .

In another embodiment a one way hash function may be used to generate a DDID that obscures each raw value. In yet another embodiment the DDID may be generated using various stochastic processes unrelated and not correlated in any way to the DDID its underlying value or any other related data e.g. a list of worldwide zip codes divided into 8 character strings and randomly resorted every 15 minutes .

Return to the AES example the Initialization Vector IV may be passed along with ciphertext because the secret key is what keeps the data secret. One benefit of the IV is that the same plaintext value can have different ciphertexts. For example if there are 10 records with the same last name or zip code while the plaintext values for those 10 names or 10 zip codes are identical the DVAL ciphertext and IV will all be unique.

To query the Anonosized database a user needs to have permission by way of JITI Keys. These are broadly intended to apply policy controls specific to intended purpose place time of use and other relevant attributes. In addition JITI Keys may enforce expiration based constraints resulting in with respect to one preferred embodiment a triumvirate of measures Query Constraints Display Constraints and Time Constraints. JITI Keys may be stored in the JITI Key DB and provide granular access control they also may determine how the raw data is displayed e.g. in DDID form transformed via one of the transformation rules or raw .

As mentioned above the terms anonosize and or anonosizing refer to replacing data with DDIDs down to the data element level. More particularly anonosizing as used herein may refer to the encoding and decoding data under controlled conditions to support specific uses of such data e.g. within designated contexts as authorized by a data subject or by an authorized third party.

Implementations of anonosizing data may allow a data management system to retain the capability to reproduce data with its original value e.g. economic intelligence wise or other and utility intact but enable the level of identifying information that is revealed to be authorized e.g. by a data subject and or an authorized third party. In some embodiments data may be revealed only to the extent necessary to support each designated data use. By anonosizing data controls e.g. via identifying and associating data elements within a population and or cohort of individuals data uses may be restricted to those uses that are permissioned by a particular data subject or authorized third party. If new authorized data uses arise all original data value and utility may be retained to support the new uses of the data to the extent authorized by the data subject or authorized third party but inappropriate i.e. non permissioned uses of identifying information may be prevented.

The following terms may be used in connection with anonosizing data according to the various embodiments described herein 

 A DDID or Association DDID refers to a DDID that is used to replace an identifying data element and de reference e.g. point to the value of the data element thus conveying a range association with or correlation between the data element and its value in order to impart informational value in a non identifying manner and optionally in accordance with specified grouping rules. Indices used to resolve de referencing may without limitation include keys schema translation tables anonymous identifiers pseudonymous identifiers tokens or other representations. De reference grouping rules for A DDIDs may be of at least two kinds of groupings Numerical and Categorical. Numerical groupings refer to ranges of numerical values represented by A DDIDs. Categorical groupings replace correlates i.e. two or more related or complementary items with A DDIDs selected to represent correlations between values within each grouped category. A DDID de reference rules may also cover multiple fields. For example a blood test may cover a number of variables from which one can infer heart attack risk so the rule could specify the various combinations required for assigning heart attack risk to a particular category e.g. high moderate or low.

 R DDID or Replacement DDID refers to a DDID that may be used to replace a primary identifying data element and de reference e.g. point to the value of the data element.

 Mosaic Effect refers to the ability to re identify a data subject by correlating data between and among seemingly anonymous data sets.

Anonosizing data by dynamically changing DDIDs minimizes the ability to re identify individuals from seemingly non identifying data due to the Mosaic Effect. Harvard University Professor Latanya Sweeney s research is cited to above as evidence that knowledge of a birthdate gender and zip code can be enough to identify as many as 87 of the people in the United States. However in order to combine a birthdate gender and zip code to achieve this 87 rate of re identification these three pieces of information must be known to relate to the same individual. As an example of dynamism achieved using DDIDs by associating a different DDID with each of birthdate gender and zip code it would not be known if a given birthdate gender or zip code relates to the same person or to some combination of different people. This lack of knowledge thereby defeats re identification via the so called Mosaic Effect. 

Thus embodiments of anonosizing herein may comprise 1. providing a method to designate data fields that contain primary and or secondary quasi identifying data elements i.e. those data elements that reveal some information about a person but do not themselves explicitly reveal the person s true identity to be replaced with a R DDID and or A DDID and 2. providing a method to establish de referencing policy rules for replacing primary and secondary quasi identifying data elements with R DDIDs and or A DDIDs and or to specify format requirements for said R DDIDs and or A DDIDs e.g. field length and character type e.g. alpha numeric alphanumeric etc. dynamism requirements for changing said R DDIDs and or A DDIDs e.g. triggers to cause change frequency of change etc. .

At step in one example the abstraction module of the privacy server determines the attribute combinations necessary to perform with respect to a desired action activity process or trait and retrieves them from the database as attribute combination A AC A . In this example implementation of the system the abstraction module of the privacy server is configured to add or delete attributes retrieve attribute combinations and to modify attributes within any given combination.

In an example involving an ecommerce site selling sports equipment the abstraction module of the privacy server may determine that attributes pertaining to a Data Subject s height weight and budget are necessary to perform with respect to a desired action activity process or trait and therefore may retrieve the attributes of height weight and budget for the specified Data Subject from the database to form an attribute combination comprised thereof. In another example involving a physician requesting blood pressure information the abstraction module of the privacy server may determine that attributes comprised of the most recently recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure values are necessary to perform with respect to a desired action activity process or trait and therefore may retrieve the most recently recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure values for the specified Data Subject to form an attribute combination comprised thereof. Another example may involve an Internet user that goes to an online retailer of running shoes. The online retailer may not know who the user is or even if the user has visited the site one or more times in the past. The user may want the visited site to know he has been shopping for running shoes and may want the visited site to know what shoes the user has looked at over the last few weeks on other sites. The user may notify the privacy server to release only the recent shopping and other user defined information to the visited site. As a result in this example the privacy server may select the following attributes shoe size 9 shoes recently viewed at other websites Nike X Asics Y New Balance Z average price of the shoes viewed 109 zip code of the shopper 80302 gender of the shopper male weight of the shopper 185 lbs. The privacy server may collect these attributes generate a unique DDID or accept or modify a temporally unique dynamically changing value to serve as the DDID and assign the DDID to the attributes and send the same to the visited web site as a TDR. If the user views a Saucony model the website may append this attribute to the information pertaining to the attributes related to shoes viewed and send this information back to the privacy server as part of the augmented TDR.

Yet another example may involve a personal banker at a bank who is working with a client who wants to add a savings account to the accounts she otherwise holds with the bank. The personal banker may not need to know all information about the client just the information necessary to open up the account. Using the present invention the banker may query the bank s privacy server via a privacy client to request opening up a new savings account for the customer. The bank s privacy server may determine the data authorization limits for the requester and for the desired action. The bank s privacy server may collect the following attributes on the customer name Jane Doe current account number 12345678 type of current account checking address of the customer 123 Main Street Boulder Colo. 80302 other signatories on the checking account Bill Doe relationship of signatory to customer husband. After the bank s privacy server collects these attributes it assigns a DDID for these attributes and sends the information to the personal banker via a privacy client as an augmented TDR.

The controlling entity could elect in one example to include data attributes in attribute combination A that enable recipients of the TDR to use existing tracking technology to track related party ZZ anonymously for the duration of existence of the resulting TDR. The controlling entity may also elect to include data that is more accurate than that available via existing tracking technologies to facilitate personalization and customization of offerings for related party ZZ.

At step in one example a request is made of the privacy server PS for a DDID. This may include a request for specified levels of abstraction and for the generation of a unique DDID or acceptance or modification of a temporally unique dynamically changing value to serve as the DDID to be used in the system corresponding with respect to a particular activity action process or trait requested. Before assigning the DDID the PS may verify that the DDID value is not actively being used by another TDR potentially including a buffer period to address potential outages and system down time.

At step in one example the abstraction module of the PS assigns and stores the DDID in response to requests with respect to actions activities processes or traits. Step may also include in one example the operation of assigning a DDID X for the web browsing requested by related party ZZ.

At step in one example the abstraction module of the PS combines the retrieved applicable attribute combination and assigns DDID X to create the TDR. The TDR itself may not include information about the real identify of related party ZZ but the maintenance module of the privacy server may retain information necessary to re associate the TDR with related party ZZ. Operation may also include the secure database s associating the attribute combination request with the Data Subject associated with the attribute combination thereby providing an internal record in the aggregated data profile for the Data Subject associating related party ZZ with particular attribute combination A that are deemed necessary to perform with respect to a desired action activity process or trait.

Once the TDR s purpose is served or a predetermined temporal limitation is reached in one example the TDR may be sent via the privacy client back to the privacy server at step the TDR that comes back may be augmented with new attribute combinations with respect to a desired action activity process or trait for which the TDR was created. In the example shown in related party ZZ performs the desired web browsing in connection with the service provider merchant or vendor and attribute combination Q AC Q is generated that reflects attribute combinations associated with the desired web browsing performed. When the web browsing is complete or when the temporal limitations of the TDR expire the privacy client with the TDR now augmented with attribute combination Q reflecting data associated with the web browsing transmits data from the service provider vendor or merchant to the privacy server. When the data is received back at the privacy server a time period stamp is associated with the TDR in one example by means of time keys TKs or otherwise and the relevant attribute combinations returned from the service provider vendor or merchant may be updated and stored in the secure database s in the aggregated data profile for the Data Subject.

Example 2 in reflects one potential implementation of a multi layer abstraction implementation of a system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The abstraction provided is a function of multiple applications of the system rather than of wholly different pieces. The dynamic nature of the TDRs allows for the same baseline principles to be used among the levels of abstraction while still providing useable interaction with regard to data as requested. In this example an entity with authorized access to privacy server A and associated secure database would have access to the associations between DDID X DDID P DDID TS and DDID YY as well as each of the attribute combinations and time periods stamps associated with the DDIDs. However the entity would not have access in one example to any information concerning associations between the different DDIDs disclosed. Only upon gaining access to privacy server B and associated secure database would the second level of abstraction be revealed pertaining to the relationship between DDID X and DDID and between DDID TS and DDID YY. As shown in this second level of abstraction could be the relationship of Subject DD to DDIDs X and P and the relationship of Subject CV to DDIDs TS and YY.

In the event that Subject CV and Subject DD reflect the identity of Data Subjects in question Example 2 would reflect one potential implementation of a two layer abstraction implementation of the system. However if the values for Subject CV and Subject DD were each assigned dynamically changeable DDIDs then Example 2 would reflect one potential implementation of a three layer abstraction implementation of the system. It should be appreciated that any and all of the elements of the system can be abstracted on multiple levels in order to achieve desired levels of security and privacy anonymity.

In one example implementation of the system both Example 1 and Example 2 in may represent an authenticated data structure that permits the verification module of the privacy server to validate and verify attribute combinations and DDIDs embodied in a TDR and or data profile at any point in time by methodologies such as cyclic redundancy checks CRCs message authentication codes digital watermarking and linking based time stamping methodologies. These methodologies enable verification of the state and composition of data at various points of time by confirming the composition of each Data Subject attribute attribute combination aggregated data profile and other elements contained in the privacy server at different points in time.

In addition in one example implementation of an embodiment of the present invention both Example 1 and Example 2 in may include data necessary for the access log module to enable post incident forensic analysis in the event of system related errors or misuse.

At step in a data attribute is received or created as input to the system. As noted previously for purposes of this disclosure a data attribute refers to any data element that can be used independently or in combination with other data elements to identify a Data Subject such as a person place or thing or associated actions activities processes or traits. One example of a data attribute may be the street address comprised of 1777 6th Street Boulder Colo. 80302.

At step of the data attribute is associated with the applicable subject. In the above example the data attribute address is associated with the subject Colorado Municipal Court Building.

At step of the elements associated with each data attribute are linked to or bound with the data attribute and determinations are made comprising applicable category s value s and classification s pertaining to attributes to facilitate use of the attributes with respect to desired actions activities processes or traits. For example elements associated with the above data attribute address may be a categorized as a street address b with values of 1 7 7 7 6th S t r e e t B o u l d e r C o l o r a d o 8 0 3 0 2 1777 6th Street Boulder Colorado 80302 or any combination of the foregoing and c classified as constant in nature since the building is stationary. Another example of a data attribute pertaining to the subject building may be the condition of the building a categorized as the condition of the building b with a value of good condition and c classified as variable in nature since the condition of the building may improve of degenerate over time. Another example of a data attribute pertaining to the subject building may be a categorized as organizations having offices located in the building b with a value of Boulder Colo. Alternative Sentencing Program CASP and c classified as variable in nature since CASP may in the future change the location of their office. It should be noted that exogenous information may comprise attributes associated with a Data Subject. For example in the case of the building identified above if someone knows that Boulder Colo. Alternative Sentencing Program CASP has offices at the Colorado Municipal Court Building and discovers that John Smith works at CASP and that on weekdays John Smith shows up at 1777 6th Street in Boulder that original person may use this exogenous information to discern the address of the Colorado Municipal Court Building in Boulder. Thus the fact that John Smith works at CASP may be an attribute of the Data Subject potentially revealing the Data Subject i.e. the building at the address.

At step in each of the data attributes input into the system are added to an aggregated data profile see e.g. for the Data Subject. In the above example the noted data attributes would be added to the aggregated data profile for the Colorado Municipal Court Building.

At step attribute combinations are identified and formed so as to provide support with respect to a desired activity action process or trait. This step may include the creation or loading of templates that specify the one or more attributes necessary with respect to a particular action activity process or trait. For example for an e commerce action the template may request information pertaining to the Data Subject s age sex size and preferred color s as attributes. In another example involving a travel reservation function the template may request information pertaining to the Data Subject s preferred means of air travel by coach business class or first class as attributes. The privacy server may be loaded with or have access to a plurality of such templates in order to support a wide variety of differing actions activities processes and or traits. In addition the privacy server may be configured to facilitate the manual override of established templates if as desired by the controlling entity and creation of new templates with respect to desired new actions activities processes and or traits. Such manual override may occur for instance by means of a graphical user interface of a privacy client running on a Data Subject s mobile device. For instance a Data Subject may use the graphical user interface to override the request for information pertaining to the Data Subject s preferred means of air travel by coach business class or first class because in one example the Data Subject may be traveling by cruise ship and therefore the Data Subject may desire to specify whether he she wants a suite balcony stateroom outside stateroom or inside stateroom as attributes. In this example the graphical user interface may permit the Data Subject to elect the minimal attributes for transmission from the Data Subject s aggregated data profile.

At step requests are received by the privacy server from privacy clients that may reside on Data Subject devices on service provider devices accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server with regard to a specific action activity process or trait. The nature and substance of requests that may be received by the privacy server from privacy clients may vary in nature depending on a variety of factors comprising whether the system is implemented as DRMI DRMD or otherwise whether a request pertains to healthcare education mobile financial Web Internet of Things or other applications etc.

At step a determination is made regarding the level of abstraction appropriate for the desired level of security anonymity privacy and relevancy with respect to a particular action activity process or trait. For example the system may introduce an initial layer of abstraction by linking relevant data attributes separating relevant data attributes into one or more TDR as determined desirable with respect to a given action activity process or trait. Additional layers of abstraction may be introduced beyond separating data attributes into one or more TDR by means of abstracting individual attributes attribute combinations or both by replacing them with DDIDs that cannot be understood without access to replacement keys RKs . The privacy anonymity and security of attributes contained or referenced within a TDR may be further improved or enhanced by using known protection techniques such as encrypting tokenizing pseudonymizing and eliding and further layers of abstraction may be introduced by using additional DDIDs to refer to networks internets intranets and third party computers that may be integrated or communicate with one or more embodiments of the present invention.

At step desired attribute combinations are selected by a controlling entity from the privacy server based on the attributes associated with the applicable template as may be necessary with respect to a desired action activity process or trait. The abstraction module may determine desired attributes that may be controlled by the controlling entity or delegated to another entity as an authorized party where the authorized party may choose to use the abstraction module to select attributes based on established templates select attributes on the fly or intelligently detect appropriate input among other methods.

In one example of step with an e commerce site selling sports equipment an internet browser provider that is acting as the controlling entity may use the abstraction module of the privacy server to determine that information regarding a Data Subject s height weight and budget are needed for a receiving web site to give options for appropriate sports equipment such as kayaks and paddles.

At step the abstraction module of the privacy server generates unique DDIDs or accepts or modifies temporally unique dynamically changing values to serve as DDIDs and assigns a DDID to each attribute combination of operation to form TDRs. These DDIDs may serve various functions including but not limited to replacement or simple association. For example if the internet browser provider acting as the controlling entity instructs the abstraction module to create a TDR with a single layer of abstraction it may assign a DDID that is not visibly associated with other TDRs for the same Data Subject without access to association keys AKs . As another example if the internet browser provider acting as the controlling entity instructs the abstraction module to create a TDR with two layers of abstraction it may i assign DDIDs to be associated with the data attributes for the duration of the TDR and ii further abstract the data attributes by assigning a DDID of Ab5 to the Data Subject s weight a DDID of 67h to the Data Subject s height and a DDID of Gw2 to the Data Subject s budget that cannot be understood without access to replacement keys RKs . Step may also include obtaining one or more attributes from one or more databases the attributes relating to the Data Subject. The DDIDs utilized in step may be confirmed as not being currently in use and may be selected from expired previously used DDIDs.

At step TDRs comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs are transmitted by the privacy server via privacy clients to recipient entities for use by recipient entities in connection with desired actions activities processes or traits pertaining to recipient entities. In the above example for instance the internet browser provider acting as the controlling entity may deliver to the ecommerce site as the recipient entity a TDR comprised of a DDID together with second level abstracted data attributes comprised of Ab5 67h and Gw2.

At step TDRs which may be comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs with respect to desired actions activities processes or traits are received by recipient entities by means of privacy clients. To the extent that the intended use of the system is to enable creation of output for big data analytics the receipt of the TDRs may be the last step e.g. see the example of a potential embodiment of the invention discussed in the context of Figure Z to provide privatized anonymized data for big data analytics so applicable Data Subject s have the right to be forgotten however more interactive use of TDRs may involve optional steps through .

At optional step TDRs which may be comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs for a desired online action activity process or trait are interpreted by recipient entities by means of privacy clients and provide access to use of AKs and or RKs as necessary to understand the contents of the TDRs. In the above example for instance the ecommerce site as the recipient entity would access the RK information to understand the value attributed to Ab5 for the Data Subject s weight the value attributed to 67h for the Data Subject s height and the value attributed to Gw2 to the Data Subject s budget.

At optional step the privacy client may capture new data attributes associated with the desired online action activity process or trait that augment the original TDR data attributes as new information in TDR format.

At optional step the privacy client may capture new data attributes associated with offline activity if any associated with the desired online action activity process or trait that augment the original TDR data attributes as new information in TDR format.

At optional step privacy clients transmit TDRs comprised of DDIDs and attribute combinations pertaining to online offline sessions back to the privacy server.

In the context of steps and since TDRs are transmitted via privacy clients to the privacy server without AKs or RKs they are transmitted in a disaggregated and anonymized format so that if someone intercepts the TDRs they will not receive all data applicable to the Data Subject desired action activity process or trait.

At optional step in one example re aggregation of attribute combinations is performed through application by the maintenance module of relationship information between and among DDIDs and attribute combinations by means of association keys AKs and DKs residing at the privacy server. In the example this would mean that the original or modified TDRs return to the privacy server which may then modify or add the new information about recommended kayaks and paddles to the aggregated data profile for the Data Subject.

Upon completion of aforementioned re aggregation of new data regarding the desired action activity process or trait from the attribute combinations in one example the DDID may then be considered expired and reintroduced to the system at optional step for reassignment and use with other attributes attribute combinations Data Subjects actions activities processes traits or data forming new TDRs in the same fashion as described above.

For instance the DDIDs Ab5 67h and Gw2 assigned to the attributes in step above may then be assigned to data attributes pertaining to other Data Subjects for instance in a like case hop or distant case leap manner. For example a like case hop may include re association of Ab5 to a second Data Subject of the same or similar weight as the initial Data Subject or re association of a piece of data on weight or something involving the same number but not associated with the same Data Subject whereas a distant case leap may involve reassigning Ab5 to an unrelated data attribute awaiting an DDID.

In a second example of a physician may request blood pressure information pertaining to a specified Data Subject who is a patient as collected offline by a nurse and entered online into the Data Subject s aggregated data profile. This request may cause the abstraction module of the privacy server as part of step above to extract the attribute combination composed of the most recently recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure values for the Data Subject. As part of step in lieu of specifying the Data Subject s identity the privacy server may combine those attribute combinations with an DDID assigned by the privacy server to form a TDR. As part of step the blood pressure attributes may be communicated to the physician together with the assigned DDID via the privacy client that may reside on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and reside in a cloud network or reside on the same computing device as the privacy server. At this point the combination of the DDID and attribute combination pertaining to blood pressure would comprise the TDR. As part of step the physician as the recipient entity may read the blood pressure values via means of the RKs and as part of steps and may record online and offline observations recommendations or comments pertaining to the blood pressure reading as new data attributes. As part of step the TDR augmented with online offline information may be returned to the privacy server via the privacy client. As part of step the privacy server may use the information to update the Data Subject s aggregated data profile. In this manner an unintended recipient of the TDR would be unable to correlate the identity of the Data Subject and would only see the DDID which may be reassigned to another Data Subject in a like case hop or distant case leap manner after use by the physician.

At step in a third party data source submits data that includes one or more data attributes pertaining to one or more Data Subjects as input to the system. It should be noted that in the embodiment of the invention represented by prior to submitting data that includes one or more data attributes pertaining to one or more Data Subjects input to the system the third party data source would have already created an aggregated data profile for each Data Subject see e.g. which the third party data source would maintain directly or indirectly in one or more databases.

At step requests are received by the privacy server from privacy clients that may reside on Data Subject devices on service provider devices accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server with regard to a specific action activity process or trait. The nature and substance of requests that may be received by the privacy server from privacy clients may vary in nature depending on a variety of factors comprising whether the system is implemented as DRMI DRMD or otherwise whether a request pertains to healthcare education mobile financial Web Internet of Things or other applications etc.

The privacy anonymity and security of attributes contained or referenced within a TDR may be further improved or enhanced by using known protection techniques such as encrypting tokenizing pseudonymizing and eliding and further layers of abstraction may be introduced by using additional DDIDs to refer to networks internets intranets and third party computers that may be integrated or communicate with one or more embodiments of the present invention.

At step a determination is made regarding the level of abstraction appropriate for the desired level of security anonymity privacy and relevancy for a particular action activity process or trait. For example the system may introduce abstraction by means of abstracting individual attributes attribute combinations or both by representing them with DDIDs that cannot be understood without access to replacement keys RKs . The privacy anonymity and security of attributes contained or referenced within a TDR may be further improved or enhanced by using known protection techniques such as encrypting tokenizing pseudonymizing and eliding and further layers of abstraction may be introduced by using additional DDIDs to refer to networks internets intranets and third party computers that may be integrated or communicate with one or more embodiments of the present invention.

At step desired attribute combinations are selected by a controlling entity from the privacy server based on the attributes associated with the applicable template as may be necessary with respect to a desired action activity process or trait. The abstraction module may determine desired attributes that may be controlled by the controlling entity or delegated to another entity as an authorized party where the authorized party may choose to use the abstraction module to select attributes based on established templates select attributes on the fly or intelligently detect appropriate input among other methods.

In one example of step in the context of healthcare research a hospital that is acting as the controlling entity may use the abstraction module of the privacy server to obfuscate information regarding a Data Subject s height weight and name before sending the information to a research facility.

At step the abstraction module of the privacy server assigns a DDID to each attribute combination of operation to form TDRs. These DDIDs may serve various functions including but not limited to replacement or simple association. For example if hospital acting as the controlling entity instructs the abstraction module to create a TDR with two layers of abstraction it may abstract the data attributes by assigning a DDID of Ab5 to the Data Subject s weight a DDID of 67h to the Data Subject s height and a DDID of Gw2 to the Data Subject s name that cannot be understood without access to replacement keys RKs . Step may also include obtaining one or more attributes from one or more databases the attributes relating to the Data Subject. The DDIDs utilized in step may be confirmed as not being currently in use and may be selected from expired previously used DDIDs.

At step TDRs comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs are transmitted by the privacy server via privacy clients to recipient entities for use by recipient entities in connection with desired actions activities processes or traits pertaining to recipient entities. In the above example for instance the hospital acting as the controlling entity may deliver to the research facility as the recipient entity a TDR comprised of abstracted data attributes comprised of Ab5 67h and Gw2.

At step TDRs which may be comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs with respect to a desired action activity process or trait are received by recipient entities by means of privacy clients. In the above example for instance the research facility as the recipient entity would receive the information for analysis but without divulging personally identifying information pertaining to weight height. Rather the research facility would receive Ab5 67h and Gw2 that it could not decipher unless granted access to relevant RK information. To the extent that the intended purpose is big data analysis the receipt of the TDRs may be the last step however more interactive use of TDRs may involve optional steps through .

At optional step TDRs which may be comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs with respect to a desired action activity process or trait are interpreted by recipient entities by means of privacy clients and provide access to use of AKs and or RKs as necessary to understand the contents of the TDRs.

At optional step the privacy client may capture new data attributes associated with respect to the desired online action activity process or trait that augment the original TDR data attributes as new information in TDR format.

At optional step the privacy client may capture new data attributes associated with offline activity if any associated with the desired online action activity process or trait that augment the original TDR data attributes as new information in TDR format.

At optional step privacy clients transmit TDRs comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs pertaining to online offline sessions back to the privacy server. Since TDRs are transmitted via privacy clients to the privacy server without AKs and or RKS they are transmitted in a disaggregated and anonymized format so if someone intercepts the TDRs they will not receive all data applicable to the Data Subject or desired action activity process or trait.

At optional step in one example re aggregation of attribute combinations is performed through application by the maintenance module of relationship information between and among DDID and attribute combinations by means of association keys AKs and or replacement keys RKs residing at the privacy server. In the example this would mean that the original or modified TDRs return to the privacy server which may then modify or add the new information about recommended kayaks and paddles to the aggregated data profile for the Data Subject.

Upon completion of aforementioned re aggregation of new data regarding the desired action activity process or trait from the attribute combinations in one example the DDID may then be considered expired and reintroduced to the system at optional step for reassignment and use with other attributes attribute combinations Data Subjects actions activities processes traits or data forming new TDRs in the same fashion as described above.

In one potential embodiment of the present invention the obscuring of sensitive data as described above may occur only with respect to a certain computer application that requests data from the subject one or more databases by intercepting requests for sensitive data from the one or more database s at the presentation layer of said computer application and replacing the sensitive data with one or more DDIDs as described above. In another potential embodiment of the present invention obscuring of sensitive data may occur with respect to one or more computer applications that request data from the subject one or more databases by intercepting requests for sensitive data at the one or more database s connection level s and replacing the sensitive data with one or more DDIDs as described above.

At step in requests are received by the privacy server from privacy clients that may reside on Data Subject devices on service provider devices accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server with regard to data elements contained in one or more databases whether the one or more databases are internal to the system as illustrated in and or external to the system as illustrated in considered too sensitive to be revealed in an identifiable manner external to an organization e.g. data which directly identifies a Data Subject or sensitive action activity process and or trait a direct identifier or indirectly identifies a Data Subject or sensitive action activity process and or trait when combined with other data a quasi identifier . The nature and substance of requests that may be received by the privacy server from privacy clients may vary in nature depending on a variety of factors comprising whether the system is implemented as DRMI DRMD or otherwise whether a request pertains to healthcare education mobile financial Web Internet of Things or other applications etc.

At step the abstraction module determines the level of abstraction appropriate for the desired level of security privacy anonymity and relevancy for the sensitive data elements consistent with PERMS established by a Data Subject or Trusted Party and DDID association strategies are developed for the sensitive data elements consistent with the scope of data use analysis permitted by said PERMS.

At step the one or more DDIDs determined by the abstraction module to dynamically obscure the sensitive data elements are sent to the privacy client.

At step the one or more sensitive data elements are dynamically obscured by replacing said data elements with one or more DDIDs determined by the abstraction module and resulting DDIDs are used to replace the sensitive data elements in data communicated externally to the organization. In one example of step the obscuring of sensitive data elements occurs only with respect to a certain computer application that requests data from the subject one or more databases by intercepting requests for sensitive data from the one or more database s at the presentation layer of said computer application and replacing the sensitive data with one or more DDIDs as determined by the abstraction module. In another example of step the obscuring of sensitive data elements occurs with respect to one or more computer applications that request data from the subject one or more databases by intercepting requests for sensitive data from the one or more database s at the one or more database s connection level s and replacing the sensitive data with one or more DDIDs as determined by the abstraction module.

At step keys necessary to understand the association s between the one or more DDIDs and the obscured sensitive data elements are securely stored in a Circle of Trust CoT .

At step keys necessary to understand the association s between the one or more DDIDs and the obscured sensitive data elements that are securely stored in a Circle of Trust CoT are made available only to authorized parties. Sensitive data represented by the one or more DDIDs is not be disclosed until keys are requested by one or more parties that have been authorized by the Data Subject or Trusted Party to receive and or make use of the underlying sensitive data.

At step a TDR comprised of attribute combinations selected by the controlling entity combined with a DDID to be associated with the data attributes for the duration of the TDR are received by a recipient client by means of a privacy client residing on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server indicating a request with respect to a desired action activity process or trait. For instance in the kayak example above the e commerce site receiving entity may receive the Data Subject s TDR request with respect to a desired action activity process or trait.

At step TDRs which may be comprised of attribute combinations and DDIDs for the desired online action activity process or trait are interpreted by the recipient entity by means of a privacy client that provides access to use of AKs and or RKs as necessary to understand the contents of the TDRs. In the above example for instance the ecommerce site would access the RK information residing on Data Subject devices on service provider devices accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server to understand the value attributed to Ab5 for the Data Subject s weight the value attributed to 67h for the Data Subject s height and the value attributed to Gw2 to the Data Subject s budget.

At step in one example the receiving entity may use the TDR information it has received to customize a response to the Data Subject s transmitted attributes. In the kayak example this would allow the ecommerce site to use the information to give the Data Subject suggestions on which kayak and paddle to purchase.

At step in one example the privacy client captures data for online activity performed at the recipient entity that is associated with attribute combinations by means of access to a privacy client that may be residing on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server.

At step in one example the recipient entity captures data for offline activity if any associated with attribute combinations and converts this into online data. In an instance such as the kayak example if the Data Subject is also a loyalty rewards member at physical store locations also operated by the ecommerce site and has opted to let other preferences be known the receiving entity may further augment the received data with this online component.

At step in one example the privacy client then transmits data pertaining to online sessions and offline activity associated with attribute combinations and DDIDs in disaggregated and anonymized format to the privacy server.

At step since the DDID components of TDRs are reintroduced to the system for reassignment and use with other attributes attribute combinations Data Subjects actions activities processes traits or data forming new TDRs in the same fashion as described above the recipient entity may see the same DDID at a later time but the DDID may have no connection to any other TDR associated with the Data Subject or otherwise with regard to which it was previously associated. For example later that day or week the ecommerce site may see the same DDID again but attached to different information pertaining to an entirely different Data Subject.

In a second example of the physician requesting the blood pressure information may receive as part of step via the privacy client a TDR comprised of the most recently recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure values and the DDID assigned by the privacy server to the Data Subject. As part of steps and the physician is able to read the blood pressure information. As part of steps and the physician may add observations recommendations or comments pertaining to the blood pressure that as part of step would then be sent to the privacy server via the privacy client that may be residing on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server.

At step in one example a recipient entity transmits a request to the privacy server via a privacy client that may be residing on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and residing in a cloud network or residing on the same computing device as the privacy server requesting the privacy server to confirm whether an undisclosed Data Subject or related party associated with a TDR is authorized to participate with respect to an action activity process or trait at a particular time and or place. For instance when after looking through the recommended kayaks and paddles on the e commerce site the related party is ready to make a purchase the e commerce site may query the authentication module of the privacy server to determine whether the related party is authorized to consummate the requested transaction.

At step in one example the authentication module of the privacy server compares the DDID included in the TDR to a list of authorized DDIDs contained in a database to determine authorization of the Data Subject or related party to participate with respect to a desired action activity process or trait at the specified time and or place. In terms of the kayak example the authentication module of the privacy server may ensure that the DDIDs being used are still active and authorized thereby indicating that the Data Subject or related party is authorized to consummate the desired transaction.

Optionally at step in one example the privacy server may request the party in control of a privacy client that may reside on a Data Subject device on a service provider device accessible via and reside in a cloud network or reside on the same computing device as the privacy server in this case the e commerce site to confirm they are authorized to participate in the desired transaction.

If optional step is invoked in one example step checks to determine if the party in control of the privacy client is verified as being authorized. For example in order to avoid deceptive attempts to acquire information such as usernames passwords or credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity also known as phishing step may require verification by the e commerce site that it is an authorized reseller of the kayak equipment by means of known confirmation techniques.

At step in one example if verification is obtained the authentication module of the privacy server transmits the authorization status information to the party in control of the privacy client.

At step in one example the authorization status information is used to allow or deny proceeding with respect to a desired action activity process or trait.

At step once the authentication function has been carried out and the optional additional verification steps are completed the privacy server sends via a privacy client the AK and or RK information necessary to interpret TDR content so that the related party may purchase the desired products and the transaction may be processed by the receiving entity which in above example may be the ecommerce site.

In a second example of a physician may send a TDR to the privacy server via a privacy client to verify whether a Data Subject that is a patient is authorized to participate in an explorative study. This would cause the authentication module of the privacy server as part of step to compare the Data Subject s DDID in the TDR to a list of authorized DDIDs contained in a database to determine if the Data Subject is authorized to participate in the study. Optionally at step the authentication module of the privacy server may request the physician submitting the request to confirm they are authorized to request that the Data Subject be a participant in the explorative study. If optional step is invoked step checks to determine if the physician is authorized by means of known confirmation techniques such as password confirmation or multi factor authentication. In step if verification is obtained the authentication module of the privacy server may transmit the authorization status information via the privacy client and in step the authorization status may be used to allow or deny the request for the Data Subject to participate in the explorative study and step would provide access to AK and or RK key information necessary to interpret TDR content and proceed.

In the kayak example data may be sent using various additional steps to protect it in transit however the receiving entity e commerce site may need the key s to unlock and or associate the three pieces of information regarding height weight and budget initially sent to it by the privacy client. At step in one example the authentication module of the privacy server compares TDR recipient attribute combinations to authorized recipient attribute combinations to determine whether the TDR recipient is an authorized recipient. If the authentication module of the privacy server verifies that TDR recipient attribute combinations matches authorized recipient attribute combinations then the authentication module of the privacy server transmits to the TDR recipient as part of step via a privacy client in one example the keys necessary to unlock the TDR.

In a second example of in step a physician receiving an encrypted tokenized or elided TDR containing requested blood pressure information may be required to send a TDR to the authentication module of the privacy server via a privacy client to verify that the physician is authorized to view the requested information. At step the authentication module of the privacy server may compare the physician s TDR information to authorized recipient attribute combinations to determine whether the physician is an authorized recipient. If the authentication module of the privacy server verifies that the physician s TDR information matches authorized recipient attribute combinations then the authentication module of the privacy server may transmit to the physician via a privacy client the keys necessary to unlock applicable protection techniques for the encrypted tokenized or elided TDR containing requested blood pressure information.

At step in one example the privacy server may assign DDID s to the attribute combinations to form TDR s on privacy clients resident on mobile wearable portable devices.

At step in one example the TDR s are transmitted to the merchant service provider recipient entity s via privacy clients resident on mobile wearable portable devices. As an example with the kayaks the store may receive the three separate TDR enabled data attributes via in store devices beacons or the like from a mobile wearable portable device of a Data Subject.

At step in one example merchant service provider recipient entity s may view attribute combinations authorized by related parties and transmitted to the merchant service provider recipient entity s by privacy clients resident on mobile wearable portable devices. For instance the store may view the height weight and budget of the related party.

At step in one example the merchant service provider recipient entity s may make offers to Data Subjects and or related parties on an anonymous basis without yet knowing the identity of the Data Subjects and or related parties.

At step in one example Data Subjects and or related parties may elect to respond to merchant service provider recipient entity s offers that they find desirable and consummate transactions.

The system and methods described herein may provide related parties with a way to achieve greater anonymity and increased privacy anonymity and security of data while utilizing one or more communication networks. Without these systems and methods third parties may be able to obtain the true identity of Data Subjects or related parties based on their activity on the communication networks via network services and or technology providers that have associated identifying information with the activity of the Data Subjects or related parties on and or between the networks.

Disclosed herein are other various methods for providing data security and data privacy anonymity. In one example a method may include the steps or operations of receiving at a computing device an electronic data element identifying one or more data attributes with the electronic data element selecting through the computing device a DDID associating the selected DDID with one or more of the data attributes and creating a TDR from at least the selected unique DDID and the one or more data attributes.

In one example the step of selecting a data element includes generating the unique DDID or in another example accepting or modifying a temporally unique dynamically changing value to serve as the DDID. In one example the method may also include causing the association between the selected DDID and the one or more data attributes to expire. In another example the method may include storing in a database accessible to the computing device information regarding the time periods during which the selected unique DDID was associated with different data attributes or combinations of attributes. In another embodiment the method may also include re associating the selected unique DDID with the one or more data attributes following expiration of the association between the DDID and the one or more data attributes. In one example the expiration of the DDID occurs at a predetermined time or the expiration may occur following completion of a predetermined event or activity. In another example the TDR may be authorized for use only during a given time period or at a predetermined location. In another example the method may include changing the unique DDID assigned to the one or more data attributes wherein the changing of the unique DDID may occur on a random or a scheduled basis or may occur following the completion of a predetermined activity or event.

Another method is disclosed herein for facilitating transactions over a network. In one example the method may include operations of receiving a request at a privacy server from a client device to conduct activity over a network determining which of a plurality of data attributes in a database are necessary to complete the requested activity creating a DDID associating the DDID with the determined data attributes to create a combined TDR making the combined TDR accessible to at least one network device for conducting or initiating the requesting activity receiving a modified TDR that includes additional information related to the activity performed and storing the modified TDR in the memory database. In another method implementation disclosed herein is a method of providing controlled distribution of electronic information. In one example the method may include receiving a request at a privacy control module to conduct an activity over a network selecting attributes of Data Subjects located in a database accessible to the privacy control module determined to be necessary to fulfill the request wherein other attributes of the Data Subject which are not determined to be necessary are not selected assigning a DDID to the selected attributes and the Data Subject or Data Subjects to which they apply with an abstraction module of the privacy control module wherein the DDID does not reveal the unselected attributes recording the time at which the unique DDID is assigned receiving an indication that the requested activity is complete receiving the unique DDID and the determined attributes and the Data Subject or Data Subjects to which they apply at the privacy control module wherein the attributes are modified to include information regarding the conducted activity and recording the time at which the conducted activity is complete and the unique DDID and the determined attributes and the Data Subject or Data Subjects to which they apply are received at the privacy control module.

In one example the method may also include assigning an additional DDID to one or more of the selected attributes or Data Subjects. In another example the method may include re associating using the recorded times the unique DDID and data attributes with the true identity of the Data Subjects. The method may also include reassigning the unique DDID to other data attributes and recording the time at which the unique DDID is reassigned.

Another method is disclosed herein for improving data security. In one example the method may include associating the Data Subject with at least one attribute and associating a DDID with the at least one attribute to create a TDR wherein the TDR limits access to attributes of the Data Subject to only those necessary to perform a given action. In one example the method may include assigning an association key AK and or replacement key RK to the TDR wherein access to the AK and or RK is required for authorized access to TDR. In another example the method may also include causing the association between the DDID and the at least one attribute to expire wherein the expiration occurs at a predetermined time and or the expiration may occur following completion of a predetermined event or activity. In another embodiment the method may include re associating the DDID with the at least one different attribute following an expiration of the association between the DDID and the at least one attribute. The method may also include storing in a database information regarding one or more time periods during which the DDID was associated with different data attributes or combinations of attributes.

Various approaches may be used to associate DDIDs with different attribute combinations to form TDRs. The DDIDs may have a certain or variable length and may be made up of various code composition elements such as numbers characters cases and or special characters. In addition the DDIDs may be generated in random or consistent intervals. In one example only authorized parties with access to association keys AKs and or replacement keys RKs maintained by the maintenance module necessary to re aggregate the otherwise disaggregated attribute combinations will have the capability to determine which attribute combinations are properly associated with other attribute combinations Data Subjects related parties or aggregated data profiles. However sites may still track and utilize the attribute combinations contained within TDRs in real time with the understanding that they have a temporally limited existence and that associated DDIDs may be reused later for different actions activities processes traits attribute combinations Data Subjects and or related parties.

The attribute combinations transmitted may include single or various combinations of explicit data personally identifying information PII behavioral data derived data rich data or other data.

In a first example a system may be configured so that a related party is the controlling entity authorized to designate to which other parties attribute combinations will be released. Example A illustrates how the system processes information generated by a related party related party X or RP X that engages in four different online sessions with two different service providers SP s from various industries over three different Communication Networks CN s . illustrate this example and show how information may be managed at various stages and under various circumstances in one example of an embodiment of the invention. It is understood that are provided by way of example only and that embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in ways different than shown in the examples of .

In a second example shown in a system is configured so that a service provider SP is the controlling entity authorized to designate parties to whom select attribute combinations related to SP clients are released. SP may use the system to provide improved protection for its client s identity and privacy anonymity. This includes reducing the likelihood of consumer or government backlash as a result of potential loss of privacy or anonymity as well as increasing market penetration use and acceptance of SP offerings. It is understood that are provided by way of example only and that embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in ways different than shown in the examples of .

Typically when a user visits a website Website in for the first time said web site i delivers content from the web site to the user s browser ii sends a cookie to the user s browser and iii directs the user s browser to a web address to retrieve ad content to be served on the website from the ad network Ad Network . The cookie delivered in ii above is referred to as a First Party Cookie since it relates to a website selected by the user. First Party Cookies can be beneficial to a user to help keep state information such as log in progress items in a shopping basket and other relevancies that improve the user s experience. When the user s browser requests ad information from Ad Network as part of iii above Ad Network sends an ad to the user s browser that is displayed as part of Website. If this is the first time the user s browser requests ad content from Ad Network Ad Network will also send a cookie to the user s browser. This cookie is referred to as a Third Party Cookie because it is not from a web page intended to be visited by the user. If Ad Network has not previously tracked the user Ad Network will serve an ad based on traditional ad delivery technology e.g. the nature of content on Website might be delivered . As the user visits more and more websites with ads served by Ad Network Ad Network via the Third Party Cookie sent by Ad Network to the user s browser builds a profile of the behavioral data on the user based on the pages visited time spent on each page and other variables such as information from the user s social network online or offline buying behavior psychographics and demographics together with further user information collected either by Ad Network s actions or by integrating information available from third party data providers. Based on the profile of the user created and managed by Ad Network Ad Network is able to display an ad targeted to the user based on what Ad Network determined was of highest interest to the user.

This conventional tracking of the user from site to site and page to page by third party Ad Networks has raised privacy anonymity concerns. In response the Do Not Track DNT effort was launched through the World Wide Web Consortium W3C an international body in which member organizations a full time staff and the public work together to develop Web standards for adoption by a cross section of regulators civil society and commercial entities. The major browsers i.e. IE Chrome Firefox Safari now offer a DNT option however no agreement exists on how recipient websites should respond to a DNT preference.

Despite this some providers have recognized that DNT applies to third party website tracking not first party website tracking. Under the draft W3C standard if a first party receives a DNT 1 signal the first party may engage in its normal collection and use of data. This includes the ability to customize the content services and advertising in the context of the first party experience. Under this recommendation the first party must not share data about this network interaction with third parties who could not collect the data themselves however data about the transaction may be shared with service providers acting on behalf of the first party.

In Do Not Track situations when a user visits a website Website the user s browser sends a notification to Website that the user is not to be tracked and Website sends to the user s browser a First Party Cookie and content plus the address where the browser should request the ad to be served on Website from an ad network Ad Network . Ad Network receives the request to not be tracked and sends the ad content to the user s browser but no Third Party Cookie is placed on the user s browser. The ad is provided to the user based on traditional methods of targeting which may include without limitation targeting an ad to the content of the page i.e. contextual targeting . Depending on how Do Not Track is implemented as stated above with respect to first parties the consensus places few limitations on first parties except that the first party must not share data about a DNT user s network interaction with third parties who could not collect the data themselves .

In contrast with embodiments of the present invention Do Not Track may be implemented to protect a related party s user s privacy anonymity while still delivering content and targeted ads to support the primary revenue model of the Internet. represents one of a number of potential implementations of the present invention for ad serving.

At Step in in one example a Data Subject or related party visits Website for the first time and the browser sends a Do Not Track header to Website . If desired by the Data Subject or related party the browser can also send a TDR to Website thus enabling it to include state information for improving the Data Subject or related party s experience there. Website then sends the content to the Data Subject or related party s browser.

At Step in one example the Data Subject or related party s browser requests an ad for Website from Ad Network with or without a TDR . When the TDR is not sent the Data Subject or related party will receive a traditionally targeted ad from Ad Network based on the page s content. When the TDR is sent Ad Network becomes enable to serve a highly targeted ad to the Data Subject or related party s browser based on the Data Subject or related party s relevant attributes. In this respect the ad served by Ad Network based on a TDR is likely more relevant to the Data Subject or related party than an ad served traditionally or by aggregated and therefore more generally inferential behavioral profile information the Ad Network would otherwise have collected on the Data Subject or related party.

At Step in one example as the Data Subject or related party visits additional sites WebsiteN a process similar to that in Steps and will occur. When the TDR is included the website content and the ad content will be highly targeted however at a minimum Ad Network will have no ability to collect information on or track the Data Subject or related party. Further via the privacy client resident on the browser or through other mechanisms the TDR may be included in the information sent to the website or to Ad Network .

In summary under existing ad targeting technology users may be tracked everywhere they go online yet they are served ads based on aggregated data out of which the ad network makes inferences about the particular user s preferences. This results in no user privacy anonymity and low to moderate ad relevance. By combining aspects of the present invention and Do Not Track users are empowered decide what information gets sent to which websites and ad networks. This not only enhances privacy anonymity but also ad relevance for users and improves sell through and return on investment for merchants.

Storage device may store attribute combinations software e.g. for implementing various functions on device preference information device profile information and any other suitable data. Storage device may include one or more storage mediums for tangibly recording data and program instructions including for example a hard drive or solid state memory permanent memory such as ROM semi permanent memory such as RAM or cache. Program instructions may comprise a software implementation encoded in any desired computer programming language.
