In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention electronically receives web originated activity tracking data from a particular electronic data source e.g. Piwik . In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize for example a value in a field of Order ID to automatically in real time verify that the associated web originated activity record is valid. In some embodiments if the inventive systems of the present invention determines that the Order ID is valid the inventive systems of the present invention then accepts such web originated activity record for further processing. In some embodiments any unmatched records can be separately stored in a database until the matching failure is resolved.

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize data of a particular web order to match such record to a particular active offer e.g. a creative identifies a website on which customers can order product s service s based on the particular active offer . In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize a value for the matched web offer to identify product s service s e.g. based on SKU code s and a media length e.g. a length of creative commercial . For instance in some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize automatic lookup from a list of offers to identify the particular active offer.

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention then tags flags each record of web originated activity records as being attributable or non attributable. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can then generate a report e.g. an electronic output of non attributable web originated activity records for further actions such as automatic discovery and correction of errors.

In some embodiments if needed the inventive systems of the present invention then performs time adjusting to a particular single uniform time zone.

For example if the attributably tagged records obtained from a web originated activity data analytics source are already time stamped based on the desired single uniform time zone then no further time adjustment is needed.

In other scenarios for example if the desired single uniform time zone is the U.S. Eastern time zone and the attributably tagged records obtained from a web originated activity data analytics source whose servers log transactions based on the Western time zone in respect to the main time zones of the U.S. or log records in two or more different time zones then the inventive systems of the present invention would process the attributable web records to be adjusted to the desired single uniform time zone. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can use geographic location s of where the web data analytics source is located to automatically and in real time determine the particular single uniform time zone to which all attributable records need to be adjusted. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize one or more of the following parameters to synchronize adjust to a single uniform time zone e.g. the U.S. Eastern time zone airing records the attributable web originated activity records or both.

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can for example adjust the airing records e.g. media agency response records MARs based on a time zone in which a particular airing of the particular creative associated with the particular offer was shown distributed. For instance if the desired uniform time zone for synchronizing the airing records and the web originated activity records is the U.S. Eastern time zone and the airing was shown at 9 A.M. Western Standard Time WST the airing time is adjusted to 12 P.M. Eastern Standard Time EST in the airing record. If there are two airings in two different time zones e.g. a 1airing at 9 AM EST and a 2airing at 9 AM WST the inventive systems of the present invention can generate a secondary host airing record having the airing time based on the first airing e.g. 9 AM EST and the secondary host airing 12 PM EST .

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize IP addresses from the web originated activity records to determine if there is a need for time adjustment of the airing records the web originated activity records e.g. web order records or both. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize a suitable IP address mapping tool to determine a time zone associated with the particular IP address.

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can identify a geographic location of a web host that is hosting a webpage to which customers are directed by the campaign s airings for placing their orders to determine if there is a need for time adjustment of the airing records the web originated activity records e.g. web order records or both.

After the time adjustment operation s if such is needed in some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention would have a dataset of all media airings associated with the particular offer where all times are adjusted to the same time zone. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention then selects a particular pre determined time reference window i.e. a time period ending at the time of the web order and starting at a pre determined time prior to the web order time to identify media airings based on length such as but is not limited to 

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can automatically and in real time select the particular time window and or a user can utilize at a specifically programmed user graphical interface to select adjust particular time window. For instance shows one example when the 8 hour time window has been applied to identify particular media airings for a particular order placed at P.M. as recorded in Piwik data. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can automatically and in real time group media airing records based on two or more pre determined time windows due to different time lengths for airing particular creative s .

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can select the particular time window and or a user can utilize at a specifically programmed user graphical interface to select adjust particular time window. For instance shows other examples of other time windows applied based on the length of media airings.

After the group s of media airings is are identified in some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention would utilize an IP address of the web order to determine which area s of media coverage to associate with a customer who placed the particular order. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize the area groupings such as DMA Designated Market Area regions which are the geographic areas in the United States in which local television viewing is measured by The Nielsen Company. For example a DMA region can be a group of counties that form an exclusive geographic area in which the home market television stations hold a dominance of total hours viewed. In the Nielsen example there are 210 DMA regions covering the entire continental United States Hawaii and parts of Alaska.

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can then use the particular geographic area s associated with the customer of the web order to further select for a potential match to media airings within particular time window s . For example in case of using DMA regions in some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can be configured to select media airings which are 1 local to the customer s local DMA and or 2 national based airings covering all or a few DMA regions which includes the customer s local DMA. For example identifies as highlighted airings that will be removed when the customer s DMA is Los Angeles. also shows another example of filtering out based on customer s geographic location. If an order is placed in the New York DMA on Saturday Mar. 14 2015 at 1 PM as shows in some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention be configured to select media airings which are 

After the potential media airings are selected based on geographic areas in some embodiments as shown in the inventive systems of the present invention can then use at least one financial parameter e.g. cost per spot CPS to assign a statistical measure e.g. weighted probability of the likelihood that the particular web order is due to a particular media airing. For example each probability is calculated as a ratio of net media cost CPS of a particular airing e.g. 10 137 for CNBC to the cost of all airings 27 700.05 . In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can use at least one non financial parameter e.g. Nielsen Ratings to assign a statistical measure e.g. weighted probability of the likelihood that the particular web order is due to a particular media airing. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention rounds the probabilities to whole numbers as shown in .

After the statistical measure has been applied in some embodiments as shown in the inventive systems of the present invention can create a database of records in which each media airing entry in duplicate X times where X corresponds to the whole number probability associated with the respective media airing ending with 100 records in total in the database corresponding to 100 percent. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can then utilize a random number generator function to assign a random number between 0 and 1 to each record of the 100 records in the database. shows a snapshot of such database based on s airings. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can then rank 100 records from 1 to 100 where rank 1 is assigned to a record that has a random number that is the closest to 1 and so on. For example the highest rank is assigned to the last record in which has the random number of 0.96. In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention then attributes the particular web order to the highest ranked media airing e.g. CNBC airing at 10 30 AM on Mar. 22 2015 . shows a snapshot of ranked attributed media airings for multiple transactions.

In some embodiments the inventive systems of the present invention can continuously re run the attribution processes if particular condition s trigger s is are met. For example if a web order is attributed to an airing which is then removed from the database of MARs in a future update from a media agency any order s which matched the removed airing previously are re run through the web attribution process to be assigned to a new airing. For example an airing may be removed from the database of MARs because it did not clear or did not run or the offer was decided in future to be non attributable.

In some embodiments after the particular web originated activity e.g. web order has been attributed to a particular media airing the inventive systems of the present invention can utilize the attributed transaction for further analysis by systems such as described in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 455 826 entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR ANALYZING KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS whose specific disclosures are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
