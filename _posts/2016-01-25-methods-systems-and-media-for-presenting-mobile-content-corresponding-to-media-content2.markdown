This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 827 413 filed Mar. 14 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The disclosed subject matter relates to methods systems and media for presenting mobile content corresponding to media content.

While watching a television program a viewer is often interested in information relating to the television program. For example the viewer may want to search for additional information about an actor seen in a movie or about locations that are shown in a documentary.

Search engines allow the viewer to search on the Internet for resources which include webpages images video content and audio content. A typical search engine provides a web page for entering search terms where the search terms are inputted by the viewer. Search results conducted for particular search terms are provided to the viewer. Moreover with the advent of mobile devices the use of mobile search engines has increased. For example using a mobile device the viewer may perform a search and browse through Internet content while watching the television program.

Text based search engines however may be somewhat limited for this user. In an example where the user wants to learn the name of a particular actor in a movie and obtain additional information about the particular actor the user may attempt to obtain this information by finding the name of the movie e.g. from a program guide from an online television guidance website from a printed guide etc. and searching for the movie by inputting it into a mobile search engine. The user then clicks through search results to find a webpage containing information relating to the movie e.g. an online website containing information relating to movies and television programs accesses the webpage and searches through the webpage to find information relating to the particular actor. If the user is able to find the actor on the webpage the user accesses another page on the website relating to the particular actor and scans through this page to find the desired information about the particular actor. This is a time consuming procedure for the user. Moreover this may cause the user to miss a substantial portion of the television program or to pause the television program to obtain such information via this procedure.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a method for providing information relating to media content is provided the method comprising determining using a hardware processor a channel that is providing a television program causing using the hardware processor a plurality of images relating to the television program to be presented wherein the plurality of images are selected based on the channel and a time parameter receiving using the hardware processor a user selection of an image from the plurality of images identifying using the hardware processor an entity within the selected image using one or more image recognition techniques generating using the hardware processor a search query based at least in part on the identified entity obtaining using the hardware processor a plurality of search results responsive to the generated search query and causing using the hardware processor at least one of the plurality of search results to be presented to the mobile device in response to receiving the user selection of the image.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a system for providing information relating to media content is provided the system comprising a hardware processor that is configured to determine a channel that is providing a television program cause a plurality of images relating to the television program to be presented wherein the plurality of images are selected based on the channel and a time parameter receive a user selection of an image from the plurality of images identify an entity within the selected image using one or more image recognition techniques generate a search query based at least in part on the identified entity obtain a plurality of search results responsive to the generated search query and cause at least one of the plurality of search results to be presented to the mobile device in response to receiving the user selection of the image.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a non transitory computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method for providing information relating to media content is provided. The method comprising determining a channel that is providing a television program causing a plurality of images relating to the television program to be presented wherein the plurality of images are selected based on the channel and a time parameter receiving a user selection of an image from the plurality of images identifying an entity within the selected image using one or more image recognition techniques generating a search query based at least in part on the identified entity obtaining a plurality of search results responsive to the generated search query and causing at least one of the plurality of search results to be presented to the mobile device in response to receiving the user selection of the image.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a system for providing information relating to media content is provided. The system comprising means for determining a channel that is providing a television program means for causing a plurality of images relating to the television program to be presented wherein the plurality of images are selected based on the channel and a time parameter means for receiving a user selection of an image from the plurality of images means for identifying an entity within the selected image using one or more image recognition techniques means for generating a search query based at least in part on the identified entity means for obtaining a plurality of search results responsive to the generated search query and means for causing at least one of the plurality of search results to be presented to the mobile device in response to receiving the user selection of the image.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for receiving audio data corresponding to a television program from a mobile device wherein the channel is determined based on the received audio data.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for obtaining an audio fingerprint of the audio data.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for generating the audio fingerprint from the received audio data.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for extracting an audio stream from each of a plurality of television channels means for generating for each of the plurality of television channels at least one audio fingerprint from at least a portion of the extracted audio stream that corresponds to one of the plurality of television channels and means for storing the at least one audio fingerprint in a database indexed by channel.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for comparing the audio fingerprint with the at least one stored audio fingerprint and means for identifying the television program based on the comparison.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for extracting a plurality of programming images from each of a plurality of television channels and means for storing the plurality of programming image in a database indexed by channel and time.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for using the determined channel and the time parameter to obtain the plurality of images wherein the plurality of images are a subset of the plurality of extracted programming images.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for receiving a second user selection of a region of interest within the selected image and means for identifying the entity within the region of interest using the one or more image recognition techniques.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for detecting a plurality of faces within the selected image using a facial recognition technique means for prompting the mobile device to select a face from the plurality of detected faces and means for identifying the entity associated with the selected face.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for accessing guidance data to determine the television program based on the determined channel and the timing parameter means for receiving program information relating to the television program and means for identifying the entity within the selected image using the received program information.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter mechanisms for presenting mobile content corresponding to media content are provided.

In some implementations these mechanisms can receive audio data or any other suitable media data relating to one or more programs. For example in response to launching a client application on a mobile device these mechanisms can enter a channel detection mode that includes activating an audio input device e.g. a microphone and capturing audio data corresponding to a television program currently being presented on a display device. In a more particular example an audio fingerprint or any other suitable digital representation can be generated from the received audio data where the audio fingerprint can be used to identify the same or similar portions of audio data.

In response to receiving the audio data the mechanisms can identify the channel that is providing the television program. For example upon receiving the audio data and or the audio fingerprint the mechanisms can compare the audio data against other stored representations e.g. other audio fingerprints other audio data etc. to identify the channel.

It should be noted that in some implementations audio data may not be captured. For example the channel detection mode can include identifying the channel by using the client application to detect the channel that a media playback device which is connected to the mobile device is currently tuned to. In another example when the mobile device includes a transmitter for transmitting codes such as infrared codes or code sequences to a media playback device the channel detection mode can include identifying the channel by determining the last channel that the user of the mobile device selected. In this example when the mobile device and the user input device e.g. a remote control are connected via a communications network the channel detection mode can include identifying the channel by transmitting a query to the user input device for the last channel that the user selected. In yet another example the client application can present the user of the mobile device with a list of channels for selection. In this example the client application can allow the user of the mobile device to indicate a particular channel that the user is watching on a media playback device which may or may not be connected to the mobile device .

Using the channel information associated with the audio data or any other suitable program information the mechanisms can obtain multiple images relating to the program. For example these mechanisms can enter a screenshot browsing mode that includes accessing a database of images e.g. screenshots of programming content and obtaining multiple images corresponding to the identified channel and a time parameter e.g. the last N minutes . The images can then be transmitted back to the client application executing on the mobile device for review and selection by a user of the client application. In this example the client application can present the user with multiple images that include scenes presented by the channel within a particular time period.

In response to receiving a user selection of one of the images the mechanisms can generate a search query. For example in response to receiving the selected image these mechanisms can enter a result display mode that includes identifying an entity in the selected image e.g. a person a location a landmark an object etc. and generating a search query based at least in part on the identified entity. In a more particular example the mechanisms can identify one or more entities within the selected image using one or more image recognition techniques e.g. image recognition optical character recognition facial recognition etc. . In another more particular example the mechanisms can receive a region of interest within the selected image and one or more entities can be identified within the region of interest. The region of interest can include for example a user defined region that includes a particular face a particular landmark etc.

Upon generating the search query the mechanisms can perform a search to obtain search results responsive to the search query that contains the identified entity. The search results can include for example uniform resource locators URLs associated with webpages responsive to the terms in the search query. In some implementations the mechanisms can select at least one of the search results to transmit to the client application for presenting to the user. In some implementations the mechanisms can transmit all of the search results to the client application for presenting to the user. Alternatively the mechanisms can automatically open the page associated with the selected search result e.g. the top search result on a suitable web browsing application executing on the mobile device. It should be noted that any suitable content can be provided to the mobile device such as an answer that includes entity information summarized entity information a set of links corresponding to the identified entity news information corresponding to the identified entity etc.

It should be noted that although the implementations described herein generally relate to providing mobile content corresponding to a television program this is merely illustrative. While the television program can be live broadcasted media content the mechanisms can be implemented to provide mobile content corresponding to recorded content over the top content etc.

These mechanisms can be used in a variety of applications. For example these mechanisms can be used to provide a mobile device user with the opportunity to interact with media content presented on a display device. In another example these mechanisms can be used to provide a mobile device user with additional information associated with presented media content without entering a text based search query into a search engine. In yet another example screenshots and then entity related information can be automatically presented to a user in response to launching a client application implementing the mechanisms described herein.

Turning to an illustrative example of a process for presenting search results based on media content is shown in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. At a computing device can load a client application that presents search results based on media content. The computing device can be a mobile device e.g. a cellular telephone a smartphone a tablet computing device a wearable computing device etc. .

It should be noted that the media content can include one or more programs from various sources such as programs broadcast over the air programs broadcast by a cable television provider programs broadcast by a telephone television provider programs broadcast by a satellite television provider on demand programs over the top programs Internet content streaming programs recorded programs etc.

At once the client application is loaded the client application can enter a channel detection mode which can begin by obtaining an audio sample of the television programming currently being presented. For example the client application can activate an audio input device coupled to the computing device such as a microphone where the audio input device captures and records the audio sample or any other suitable audio data associated with a presented television program. In another example the client application can receive a user indication to store audio data for transmission to an audio matching service.

In some implementations the client application can activate an audio input device that captures audio from its surroundings and uses appropriates filters and or other audio enhancements to extract an audio fingerprint or filtered audio data associated with the presented television program. For example silent portions of the audio sample can be removed to reduce the file size of the audio sample. In another example portions of the audio sample having distortion can be removed to reduce the file size of the audio sample. In yet another example in response to determining that at least a portion of the audio sample does not include audio data having a given quality the client application can prompt the user of the client application to record another audio sample.

In some implementations the client application executing on the computing device can generate an audio fingerprint of the audio sample using any suitable audio fingerprinting technique at . The audio fingerprint can be a digital representation generated from the received audio sample where the audio fingerprint can be used to identify the same or similar portions of audio data. Alternatively the client application can transmit the audio sample associated with the television program to a search system that generates an audio fingerprint.

At the client application can transmit the obtained audio sample and or the audio fingerprint for analysis. For example upon launching the client application and activating the audio input device the client application can automatically stream the audio sample and or the audio fingerprint to a search system that accesses a matching service e.g. an audio fingerprint match service . As described above the client application can stream the audio sample to a search system where the search system generates an audio fingerprint corresponding to the audio sample and transmits the audio fingerprint to an audio fingerprint match service for analysis.

In some implementations additional information can be transmitted along with the audio sample such as client device information user profile information location information user preferences timing information and other information that can be used to generate a search query associated with the audio sample of the television program.

It should be noted that in implementations described herein in which the client application or other mechanisms described herein collects information about a particular user the user can be provided with an opportunity to control whether the client application collects information about particular users and or how collected user information is used by the client application. Examples of information about a user can include the user s interests and identifying information of the user e.g. a user profile user credentials device identification etc. . Additionally certain information about the user can be stored locally e.g. not shared encrypted and or treated in one or more ways before it is stored to remove personally identifiable information. For example the client application can store user preferences and or user interests for a particular user with an anonymous user identifier e.g. a user identifier that is not associated with the user s name the user s username and or password the user s email address etc. . Using these techniques the user can have control over what information is collected about the user and or how that information is used by the client application.

Turning to upon receiving the audio sample and or other additional information from the client application at an audio fingerprint of the received audio sample can be generated at . Again the audio fingerprint can be generated by the client application or any other suitable application and transmitted to the search system for analysis.

At the search system can compare the generated audio fingerprint to multiple audio fingerprints. For example the generated audio fingerprint associated with the audio sample from the client application can be compared against a subset of stored audio fingerprints. In a more particular example the search system can access a database or other suitable storage device containing multiple audio fingerprints and filter the multiple audio fingerprints to a subset of audio fingerprints based on location information user preferences and other information received from the client application. In this example only audio fingerprints associated with the received location information can be used to compare with the generated audio fingerprint. In another example particular audio fingerprints from the database or storage device can be used for comparison before others such as audio fingerprints associated with popular channels newer audio fingerprints audio fingerprints commonly matched etc.

In some implementations the search system can for example include capture modules that receive and process signals from multiple sources e.g. multiple channels . These capture modules can for each channel capture video screenshots at particular time intervals e.g. every two or three seconds and or generate audio fingerprints from audio data at particular time intervals. Generally speaking these capture modules can monitor media content from multiple content sources and generate video screenshots audio fingerprints and or any other suitable content identifier. More particularly these capture modules can store the generated video screenshots audio fingerprints and other content identifiers in a storage device. For example a capture module can monitor channels providing broadcast television content and store generated audio fingerprints in a database that is indexed by channel and time.

It should be noted that in some implementations generated video screenshots audio fingerprints and other content identifiers indexed by channel and time in a database can be discarded after a predetermined time. For example in response to determining that a video screenshot is associated with a time outside of a particular time window the search system or any other suitable component can remove the video screenshot from the database.

At it can be determined whether a match is found. If no matching audio fingerprint is found the search system can return to and wait to receive additional audio samples from the client application. Additionally or alternatively the search system can transmit a message to the client application requesting that the user restart the client application transmit another audio sample and or input or verify particular information e.g. program information such as channel number service provider information program title etc. .

In response to identifying an audio fingerprint match at the search system can identify a channel or any other suitable content identifier associated with the matched audio fingerprint. For example the matching audio fingerprint can be associated with a channel e.g. Channel X and the search system uses the association to determine that the user of client application is watching a television program provided on that channel. In another example the search system can transmit a notification to the client application that the channel has been identified. This notification can include for example an indication that the search system has successfully identified the channel from the received audio sample and or the identified channel.

It should be noted that in some implementations the client application can initiate the channel detection mode without capturing audio information or using audio fingerprints e.g. steps of and steps of .

In some implementations the search system can include identifying a channel by detecting the channel that a media playback device which is connected to the mobile device is currently tuned to. For example the search system can transmit a query to the mobile device to determine which devices are connected to the mobile device. In response to determining that a media playback device such as a television device or a set top box is connected to the mobile device the search system can instruct the client application to communicate with the media playback device to determine the channel that the media playback device is currently tuned to. Alternatively in response to determining that a user input device such as a remote control is connected to the mobile device the search system can instruct the client application to communicate with the user input device to determine the last channel or previous channels that have been tuned to.

In a more particular example the client application executing on the mobile device can include a second screen application or can communicate with a second screen application that has been installed on the mobile device. Second screen applications can for example allow the user of the mobile device or other second screen device to be presented with content transmitted to a media playback device such as a television device or a set top box. The client application can use the second screen application to determine the channel that the media playback device is presenting on the second screen device.

In another more particular example the client application executing on the mobile can include a remote control application or can communicate with a remote control application that has been installed on the mobile device. Remote control applications can for example allow the mobile device to issue a command to control the media playback device e.g. channel up channel down etc. and in response instruct an infrared transmitter connected to the mobile device to transmit a corresponding infrared code to the media playback device. The client application can use the remote control application to determine the last channel or previous channels that have been tuned to.

In some implementations the client application can present the user of the mobile device with a list of channels for selection. In this example the search system can receive a particular channel or any other suitable content identifier that the user is currently watching on a media playback device which may or may not be connected to the mobile device .

In some implementations the client application can enter a screenshot browsing mode which can begin by transmitting a request for images corresponding to the identified channel at . For example the client application can automatically transmit a request to the search system for images such as video screenshots for the identified channel and for a particular time interval e.g. screenshots from the last N minutes provided by the identified channel . As described above the search system can include one or more databases or other suitable storage device that include stored video screenshots and other images captured from media content provided by multiple sources.

In response the search system can retrieve multiple screenshots or other images from the accessed database based on the identified channel and a given time interval at . For example the search system can receive multiple screenshots corresponding to five minutes of programming provided on a particular channel.

At the multiple screenshots and other images can be transmitted to the client application for presenting to the user.

Referring back to the multiple images associated with the television program can be presented to the user at . For example the client application can allow the user to scroll through different images e.g. screenshots where the user can scroll vertically or horizontally on the computing device. In another example the client application can provide the user with all of the multiple images where the user can pan and zoom in on particular images.

In response to receiving and presenting the multiple images to the user the client application can prompt the user to select an image from the multiple images at . For example the client application can detect when the user has placed a highlight region over an image and pressed a suitable button on the computing device. In another example when the computing device is a mobile device with a touch screen the client application can respond to contact with the touch screen such as one or more taps on the touch screen movement of the point of contact while maintaining continuous contact etc.

In some implementations in response to receiving a user selection of an image at the client application can prompt the user to select a region of interest within the selected image at . For example when the computing device is a mobile device with a touch screen the client application can request that the user provide one or more taps on a specific region of interest within the selected image. In a more particular example the client application can analyze the selected image and divide the select images into one or more subsections e.g. based on identified objects .

In a more particular implementation the client application can detect one or more faces within the selected image using a facial recognition technique. In response the client application can provide the user with the opportunity to select one of the detected faces. For example the user can select the face of an actor of interest within a selected image. The selected face can be used for further image analysis and query generation. Additionally or alternatively the client application can detect one or more objects within the selected image using an object recognition technique. This can include identifying items landmarks and or location within the selected image. Similarly the client application can provide the user with the opportunity to select one of the detected objects which can be used for further image analysis and query generation.

At the client application can enter a result display mode that transmits the user selections which can include a selected image a selected region of interest a selected face a selected object and or any other suitable portion of an image to the search server.

Turning to in response to receiving the selected image and or any other suitable portion of the image at the search system can identify an entity within the selected image using one or more image recognition techniques. For example entities can include people places events objects creatures logos characteristics features or any other suitable entity related to the television program. These entities can be associated with the television program in various ways. For example an image of a person or a landmark can be included in a video signal associated with the program.

In one particular example entities associated with the television program can be identified based on facial recognition techniques to identify people such as actors and actresses included in the selected image associated with the program. In another example entities associated with the television program can be identified based on image recognition techniques to identify landmarks included in the selected image associated with the program. In yet another example entities associated with the television program can be identified based on optical character recognition techniques to identify keywords included in the selected image associated with the program.

In some implementations the search system can obtain guidance data for providing additional information to identify the entity in the selected image. For example the search system using guidance data such as electronic program guide data can obtain a list of actors actresses and or cast members of a television program provided on the identified channel. Such guidance data can be provided along with the selected image where the search system can use one or more image recognition techniques to identify an entity within the selected image. The guidance data can for example be used to filter false positives thereby improving entity identification accuracy. The identified entity can be transmitted from an image recognition module back to the search system.

In some implementations upon identifying the entity the search system can generate a search query at . Such a search query can include the identified entity and or information relating to the identified entity. For example the search system can generate a search that includes the name of the identified entity for transmission to a search engine. In some implementations the search query can also include content information previously obtained by the search system and or the client application.

At the search system can perform a search. In some implementations the search system can perform the search by transmitting the generated search query to a search engine which can then execute the search. In some implementations the search system can use a search application programming interface API to search various content sources for search results responsive to the generated search query. Search results responsive to the generated search query can be obtained at .

In some implementations the search system can select one or more of the search results using any suitable approach. For example the search system can select the most popular search results e.g. the top ranked search result selecting the most relevant search results etc.

Alternatively instead of selecting one or more search results the search system can transmit all of the search results to the client application for presentation to the user. This can allow the user to scan through the search results and select an appropriate search result for obtaining additional information on a desired entity from an image.

In some implementations the search system can rank the search results using one or more criterion. For example the search system can assign a weight to each of the search results such that news related search results are weighted higher than commerce related search results. In another example the search system can determine that the user of the client application has set user preferences that indicate a preference to receive news related search results or pages from particular websites. In this example the search system can automatically filter the search results based on such user preferences.

The one or more search results can be transmitted to the client application for presenting to the user at . Referring back to the client application can then receive and present one or more search results associated with the selected image and or region of interest to the user. For example the client application can provide the user with a search result in response to selecting an image and in turn the user can select the search result for additional information on the identified entity in the selected image. In another example the client application can load a page associated with the search result in a web browsing application. That is in response to loading the client application and selecting an image of interest the client application can provide the user with a page containing information relating to an identified entity within the selected image.

It should be noted that in some implementations the client application can continuously and or periodically transmit an audio sample or any other suitable audio data relating to a television program being presented to the search system. In response the client application can be provided with updated images for selection and upon selecting one of the images a search result. More particularly search results corresponding to the updated audio sample and a recently selected image can be continuously and or periodically returned to the client application and displayed on a graphical user interface associated with the client application e.g. a web browsing application that loads the URL associated with the search result .

It should also be noted that in some implementations the client application can continue to identify the channel that the user of the client application is tuned. For example in response to changing from one channel to another the client application can receive an updated audio sample and identify the channel based on the updated audio sample. In another example the client application can continue to access a second screen application or a remote control application e.g. at predetermined times and identify the last channel that has been tuned to.

In response to transmitting an audio sample corresponding to television program provided on television device e.g. a generated audio fingerprint a computing device can process the audio sample to determine the channel corresponding to the audio sample. As described above this can include comparing a generated audio fingerprint with audio fingerprints that are generated by capturing audio data from multiple channels and that are stored in an audio fingerprint database. The matching audio fingerprint can be used to identify the channel associated with the audio sample and in turn the channel can be used as an identifier in a database of images e.g. video screenshots to retrieve multiple images relating to the television program or programs. As also described above a channel can be identified using other suitable approaches such as determining the last channel that has been tuned to by communicating with a second screen application or a remote control application. The channel can also be identified by prompting the user of the mobile device with a list of selectable channel identifiers and receiving a user selected channel.

As described above computing device such as a second screen device can be coupled to television device e.g. in communication with television device or a device that is causing program to be presented on television device such as a set top box or a digital media receiver. In some implementations computing device can be a stand alone device that is not coupled to television device or a device causing program to be presented on television device e.g. a second screen device such as a mobile telephone or a tablet computer is in communication with the search server . As also described above computing device can be any computing device suitable for presenting the entity related content or other associated content to a user such as a smartphone a tablet computer a wearable computer a heads up display a laptop computer a personal computer PC a smart television etc.

As shown multiple images and are presented to the user on a graphical user interface associated with the client application. It should be noted that the images can be presented in any suitable manner e.g. a scrollable list of images where images are presented one at a time multiple images can be presented at a time based on the size of the display of computing device etc. For example when the computing device is a second screen device having a large display such as a tablet computing device multiple images can be presented in the graphical user interface. In another example when the computing device is a smartphone one image can be presented at a time and the user can be provided with an option to navigate to another image e.g. using one or more gestures on a touch screen pressing a suitable button on the smartphone etc. .

In some implementations the client application can indicate that an image from the multiple images has been selected by the user. For example as shown in a highlight region can be placed around the selected image to indicate the user selection. In another example the client application can wait for a second action to indicate a selection of the highlighted image such as a swiping gesture on a touch screen or the user pressing a button.

In some implementations in response to selecting an image the client application can request that the user provide further information regarding the selected image. For example as shown in in response to selecting image e.g. a screenshot of a television program at a particular time the client application can request that the user select a region of interest . For example region of interest can be a free form region drawn by the user. In another example multiple regions can be presented by the client application upon performing an image recognition technique e.g. faces using a facial recognition technique objects using an object recognition technique etc. . In these examples the client application can request that the user select a region of interest for transmitting back to the search system along with the selected image. This can for example facilitate the search system in generating a search query for the desired entity e.g. an actor an actress a landmark an object etc. .

In some implementations the client application can also provide the user with supplemental options relating to the selected image or the selected region of interest. For example as shown in the client application can provide the user with options . Options can request that the user select question terms for transmitting back to the search system along with the selected image and or selected region of interest. As shown the question terms include who e.g. who is in the selected image what e.g. what is the object or landmark shown in the selected image and where e.g. where does this scene in the selected image take place . This can also facilitate the search system in generating a search query for the desired entity e.g. an actor versus a landmark in the selected image .

As also shown in in response to transmitting suitable information to the search system e.g. a selected image a selected region of interest a question term etc. a search can be generated with the identified entity in the selected image and one or more search results can be presented to the user. In this particular example the search result is displayed on a graphical user interface associated with the client application e.g. a web browsing application that loads the URL associated with the search result . More particularly in response to identifying an entity e.g. the actor in region of interest within image an actor filmography page can be automatically displayed to the user of the client application.

Turning to an illustrative example of a generalized schematic diagram of a system on which the mechanisms for presenting mobile content based on media content is shown in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. As illustrated system can include one or more computing devices . Computing devices can be connected by one or more communication links to a communications network that can be linked via a communications link to a server .

Computing devices server and content source s can be located at any suitable location.

In some implementations server can include one or more modules and or databases that can be interconnected for performing various functions of the search application and or facilitating the mechanisms for generating and presenting search results based on media content information.

In some implementations a front end server module can perform processes for generating interactive content as described above in connection with for example . For example the front end server can act as a proxy between the client application executing on computing device and other server modules such as capture module audio matching module screenshot browsing module and search module .

In some implementations a capture module can receive media data related to a program or a channel such as video data audio data electronic program guide data metadata etc. as described above in connection with for example . Additionally or alternatively capture module can extract various media data from content provided from content sources as described in connection with for example . Such extracted media data can include for example audio fingerprints subtitles video screenshots etc. This information can be stored for example in a database not shown for use by the search application executing on front end server in identifying channels obtaining screenshots and or various other operations.

In some implementations an audio matching module can receive audio fingerprint data for a program from capture module and compare the received audio fingerprint data against stored audio fingerprint data in a fingerprint database . This fingerprint database can be used for example to identify a channel as described above to determine a program that is being presented to a user etc.

In some implementations a screenshot browsing module can extract one or more images based on the identified channel. For example based on the identified channel screenshot browsing module can retrieve images corresponding to a particular time window associated with that channel. In response to receiving a user selection of an image screenshot browsing module can use a keyword extraction module or any other suitable module to extract and identify one or more entities from the image. In addition screenshot browsing module can include a recognition module that is configured to perform one or more recognition techniques such as facial recognition techniques image recognition techniques optical character recognition techniques etc.

In some implementations keyword extraction module can extract entities such as the entities described above in connection with . For example keyword extraction module can extract the identity of people places events objects creatures logos or any other suitable entity. Additionally or alternatively keyword extraction module can identify entities using recognition module which can for example compare information from an image of a face from a video screenshot to a database of known face information e.g. face information of known individuals to determine an identity of a person in the image. Similarly recognition module can for example compare information from an image of an object such as buildings statutes product packaging electronics fruit and vegetables or any other suitable object to a database of known object information to determine an identity of an object in an image. As described above any suitable recognition techniques can be used by recognition module to facilitate entity identification from program related data by keyword extraction module and or screenshot browsing module .

In some implementations front end server module can access search module . Search module can for example generate a search query based on the identified entity in the selected image and perform a search to obtain search results responsive to the search query. In a more particular example an identified entity can be transmitted to search module which constructs one or more search queries related to the content associated with the identified channel as well as the identified entity information. Once the relevant search query is generated the search query can be provided to a suitable search engine which searches one or more repositories and indexes for results responsive to the search query. In some implementations the search engine can be a general search engine that is accessed by search module using for example a search application programming interface API . Alternatively the search engine can be a search engine used exclusively by front end server or any other component of system .

As described above in some implementations the search results can be filtered and or personalized based on the user of the client application. For example search results can be removed and or retained based on user search histories previous user interaction selections user settings user profiles client device types user location and or other user information. The search results can be provided to front end server that generates the search results into a format appropriate for sending the results back to the client application executing on computing device . For example the search results can be formatted as hypertext markup language HTML content that can allow a web browsing application on computing device to display the search results e.g. by loading the associated web page . In another example the search results can be formatted such that they can be displayed within the client application executing on computing device . That is in response to loading the client application and selecting an image of interest the client application can display a search result corresponding to the media content.

In some implementations guidance data such as an electronic program guide EPG database can be accessed. For example front end server module can access guidance data to obtain program information related to an identified channel or an identified program and use the program information to filter entities search results etc. It should be noted that in some implementations guidance data can be provided from for example content source s .

It should be noted that although modules and databases are shown as being included in server these modules and or databases can be provided in different servers in various combinations.
