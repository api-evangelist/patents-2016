title: Methods and system for distributing information via multiple forms of delivery services
abstract: A content distribution facilitation system is described comprising configured servers and a network interface configured to interface with a plurality of terminals in a client server relationship and optionally with a cloud-based storage system. A request from a first source for content comprising content criteria is received, the content criteria comprising content subject matter. At least a portion of the content request content criteria is transmitted to a selected content contributor. If recorded content is received from the first content contributor, the first source is provided with access to the received recorded content. The recorded content may be transmitted via one or more networks to one or more destination devices. Optionally, a voice analysis and/or facial recognition engine are utilized to determine if the recorded content is from the first content contributor.

Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety under 37 CFR 1.57.

Social networking and microblogs enable users to quickly share information. However conventional media such as television radio and newspapers typically lack the immediacy and interactivity offered by social networks and microblogs.

Social network platforms also suffer from certain deficiencies. For example conventional social networks often fail to provide a well defined and recurring system in place for users to distribute the content that they create.

The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Certain example embodiments provide a system and process that enable users to share information content and items. Such shared information and content may be distributed over one or more distribution channels.

Certain optional embodiments provide a system and method that enables a publisher to submit a request for content to a system such as a content distribution facilitation system. The system may selectively transmit the request to one or more potential respondents. The potential respondents may optionally be identified by the system based at least in part on the request and or other criteria specified by the requester and or potential respondents may be specifically identified by the publisher. The request may optionally specify an expiration date time wherein if the request is not satisfied by the specified date time the request may expire and potential respondents may no longer accept the request.

One or more potential respondents may provide content in response to the request. The content may be newly created content that is created in response to the request and or the content may comprise preexisting previously recorded content. The system may receive and provide the response optionally including the content to the requester or the responses may be provided directly to the requester without traversing the content distribution facilitation system.

The requester may optionally evaluate the content from some or all of the respondents and may accept one or more content items e.g. to use and distribute via one or more avenues of distribution . The acceptance indication may optionally be provided via a user interface presented to the requester and the acceptance indication may be received by the content distribution facilitation system. The respondent s whose content was accepted may optionally be notified of the acceptance via the content distribution facilitation system or otherwise e.g. via email a short messaging service an instant message a dedicated application a webpage or otherwise . The respondent s whose content was accepted sometimes referred to herein as a content contributor may optionally be compensated e.g. via currency or other item of value directly by the requester and or by the content distribution facilitation system operator.

Optionally the requester need not have to actively accept content but may still be permitted to use the content.

An aspect of the disclosure relates to a computer storage system comprising a non transitory storage device said computer storage system having stored thereon executable program instructions that when executed by a computer system cause the computer system to perform operations comprising some or all of the following maintain a data store comprising profiles of a plurality of content contributors including an identification of professions associated with at least a portion of the content contributors wherein the identified professions for the portion of the content contributors include at least one of the following athlete actor agent athlete scout medical expert or celebrity and access indicators for the content contributors indicating which content requesters may submit content requests to a given content contributor provide an interface configured to receive a request to be provided to a given content contributor for video and audio content of the given content contributor identify a first requester accessing the content management and distribution system based at least on the identity of the first requester locate in the data store content contributors that the first requester is permitted access to provide a user interface comprising a listing of content contributors restricted to those content contributors to whom the first requester is permitted access to and content contributor sets previously defined by the content requester receive a request for new content from the first requester the content request comprising a selection of one or more sets of content contributors and or one or more specifically identified content contributors from the user interface comprising the listing of content contributors restricted to those content contributors to whom the first requester is permitted access to and the content contributor sets previously defined by the content requester a content subject matter specification provided via the content subject matter interface including a request for video and audio content of a content contributor discussing a first specified subject and response deadline timing information transmit at least a portion of the content request including the content subject matter specification and deadline timing information to respective applications installed on mobile communication devices of the selected set of content contributors and or of the one or more specifically identified content contributors wherein the respective applications are configured to display the request and at least partly in response to a given contributor providing a first input prompt the given contributor to capture the requested video and audio content receive an indication from one or more of the mobile communication devices of the selected set of content contributors and or of the one or more specifically identified content contributors that video and audio content is being provided provide the first requester with access to items of content captured by a respective mobile communication device from a camera from one or more content contributors in the selected set of content contributors and provide a control enabling the first requester to selectively download one or more of the items of content to a system associated with the first requester and a control enabling the first requester to selectively cause one or more of the items of content to be transmitted to a cloud based storage destination specified by the first requester.

In an example embodiment a data store of profiles of potential content contributors is provided. A request from a first requester for content comprising content criteria is received the content criteria comprising content contributor characteristics and or content contributor identifiers which may be a content contributor name and content subject matter. Based on the content contributor characteristics content contributor identifiers and or the profiles at least a first potential content contributor is identified. At least a portion of the content request content criteria is transmitted to the first potential content contributor. Recorded content is received from the first content contributor. The first requester is provided with access to the received recorded content. At least partly in response to acceptance by the first requester of the received recorded content the first requester is enabled to publish the accepted received recorded content for at least a first period of time. For example the first requester may optionally download the recorded content and publish the downloaded recorded content via a website broadcast television broadcast radio software applications by saving it to a file sharing service by publishing the content to a social media feed etc. 

An example aspect provides a method of managing content and content requests the method comprising maintaining a data store of profiles of potential content contributors receiving at a content distribution facilitation system a request for new content from a first requester the content request comprising content criteria comprising content contributor characteristics and or content contributor identifiers content subject matter instructions for contributors duration of request and or content length based at least on the content contributor characteristics and or content contributor identifiers included in the request and the profiles of potential content contributors identifying by the content distribution facilitation system at least a first plurality of potential content contributors transmitting by the content distribution facilitation system at least a portion of the content request content criteria to the first plurality of potential content contributors receiving by the content distribution facilitation system recorded content from one or more of the first plurality of potential content contributors providing via the content distribution facilitation system the first requester with access to the received recorded content receiving by the content distribution facilitation system acceptance by the first requester of at least one item of the received recorded content and enabling the first requester to publish the accepted received recorded content. For example the first requester may optionally download the recorded content and publish the downloaded recorded content via a website broadcast television broadcast radio software applications by saving it to a file sharing service by publishing the content to a social media feed etc.

An example aspect provides a method of managing content and content requests the method comprising maintaining a data store of profiles of potential content contributors receiving at a content distribution facilitation system a request for content from a first requester the content request comprising content criteria comprising content contributor characteristics and or content contributor identifiers and or content subject matter based at least on the content contributor characteristics and or content contributor identifiers included in the request and or the profiles of potential content contributors identifying by the content distribution facilitation system at least a first potential content contributor transmitting by the content distribution facilitation system at least a portion of the content request content criteria to the first potential content contributor receiving by the content distribution facilitation system recorded content from the first content contributor providing via the content distribution facilitation system the first requester with access to the received recorded content receiving by the content distribution facilitation system acceptance by the first requester of the received recorded content and enabling the first requester to publish the accepted received recorded content. For example the first requester may optionally download the recorded content and publish the downloaded recorded content via a website broadcast television broadcast radio software applications by saving it to a file sharing service by publishing the content to a social media feed etc.

An example aspect provides a system comprising at least one computing device comprising hardware non transitory memory coupled to the at least one computing device that stores instructions that when executed by the at least one computing device cause at least in part the system to perform operations comprising maintaining a data store of profiles of potential content contributors receiving at a content distribution facilitation system a request for content from a first requester the content request comprising content criteria comprising content contributor characteristics and or content contributor identifiers content subject matter based at least on the content contributor characteristics and or content contributor identifiers included in the request and the profiles of potential content contributors identifying at least a first potential content contributor transmitting at least a portion of the content request content criteria to the first potential content contributor receiving recorded content from the first content contributor providing via the content distribution facilitation system the first requester with access to the received recorded content receiving acceptance by the first requester of the received recorded content and enabling the first requester to publish the accepted received recorded content. For example the first requester may optionally download the recorded content and publish the downloaded recorded content via a website broadcast television broadcast radio software applications by saving it to a file sharing service by publishing the content to a social media feed etc.

Optionally the system restricts a given content requester s access to content contributors to a subset of content contributors. The restriction may be defined by a system operator as specified by respective content contributors and or according to defined rules e.g. a rule may specify that athletes are accessible to all requesters associated with a media publisher .

An example aspect provides a non transitory memory storing instructions that when executed by a computer system comprising at least one computing device cause the system to perform operations comprising maintaining a data store of profiles of potential content contributors receiving at a content distribution facilitation system a request for content from a first requester the content request comprising content criteria comprising content contributor characteristics content subject matter based at least on the content contributor characteristics included in the request and the profiles of potential content contributors identifying at least a first potential content contributor transmitting at least a portion of the content request content criteria to the first potential content contributor receiving recorded content from the first content contributor providing via the content distribution facilitation system the first requester with access to the received recorded content receiving acceptance by the first requester of the received recorded content and enabling the first requester to publish the accepted received recorded content.

Systems and methods are described that enable users to share information content e.g. audio video and or text content and items. Such shared information and content may be distributed over one or more distribution channels. For example certain embodiments enable requests for content to selectively be submitted to a specific target group of potential responders such as athletes actors agents athlete scouts medical experts opinion leaders industry experts celebrities a social or working group or the like. Optionally the request may be directed to a specific person or group. Certain embodiments reduce the need for content capture and storage infrastructure as distributed user devices may be used to capture content and cloud based systems may be used to store and distribute content captured from the user devices.

For example certain embodiments provide a system that enables a publisher to submit a request for such content to a content distribution facilitation system which may then selectively transmit the request to one or more potential respondents. The potential respondents may be identified by the system based at least in part on the request and or other criteria specified by the requester. The request may specify an expiration date time wherein if the request is not satisfied by the specified date time the request may expire and potential respondents may no longer accept and or respond to the request. By way of example the publisher may be an entity that needs information commentary or other content such as a producer or distributor of a television program e.g. a live sports program such as a game broadcast a radio program or an online newspaper. By way of further example the publisher may be a venue such as a stadium where the responder s submission in response to the request may be published on an electronic sign or display e.g. a large screen television within the venue.

The one or more potential respondents may provide content in response to the request. The content may be newly created content that is created in response to the request or the content may be preexisting previously recorded content. The system may receive and provide the response including the content to the requester or the responses may be provided directly to the requester without traversing the content distribution facilitation system. The requester may then evaluate the content from some or all of the respondents and accept one or more to use and distribute via one or more avenues of distribution. The acceptance indication may be provided via a user interface presented to the requester e.g. by activating an acceptance control and the acceptance indication may be received by the content distribution facilitation system. The respondent s whose content was accepted may be notified of the acceptance via the content distribution facilitation system or otherwise e.g. via email a short messaging service an instant message a dedicated application a webpage or otherwise . Optionally the respondent s whose content was accepted sometimes referred to herein as a content contributor may be compensated directly by the requester and or by the content distribution facilitation system operator. Optionally the respondent s are not compensated.

Optionally the requester does not have to actively accept the content in order to use the content and optionally no content acceptance notification is provided to the respondent. For example the requester e.g. a publisher may have pre negotiated prior to the content request an arrangement with the respondent to provide future content for a specified period of time e.g. a one year contract for a specific event e.g. a sports tournament or a specific game or set of games or for specific subject matter. Hence the respondent may be under a contractual obligation to provide the content and the requester may have the right to use the content even in the absence of a formal acceptance of the received content. Optionally even if a formal acceptance notification is not provided to the respondent the system may provide a notification indicating if the requester utilized the responder s content and may optionally indicate how where the content was used e.g. on broadcast television on an online website via a streaming television services etc. . Optionally the requester may instruct the system to provide such a notification and may specify how the content was used or not to provide such a notification. The system will then store and execute the requester s instruction.

Optionally prior to the content being provided to the requester the content distribution facilitation system may provide access to the submitted content to a verification entity that automatically and or manually examines the content and determines if the content violates content rules or guidelines established and or recorded by the requester or by a third party whose rules or guidelines the content needs to satisfy in order for the content to be published broadcast by the requester. For example if the content is being provided by a player for a sports team to a sports broadcasting network the content may be examined by the verification entity to ensure that the submitted content meets the rules or guidelines of the union to which the player belongs e.g. to ensure the content will not trigger a grievance . The guidelines or rules may be stored in a data store. The verification can be performed automatically by a verification system which may be included in the content distribution facilitation system described herein or which may be a separate system operated by a separate entity that has access to the data store of rules and that is configured to convert the voice content if the content includes a sound voice track to text using a continuous speech recognition engine and to compare the text to the rules to detect whether the content violates one or more rules.

For example the continuous speech recognition engine may utilize natural language processing. Optionally the natural language processing may utilize a parse tree representing a syntactic structure of a phrase or sentence according to a formal grammar. Optionally the natural language processing may utilize statistical modeling configured to make soft probabilistic decisions based on attaching real valued weights to respective input features. Optionally the natural language processing may utilize semantic indexing.

The verification system may generate a report identifying the rules violated and or the content that violated the rules. For example the report may include rule text e.g. players are not allowed to criticize the team manager or players are not permitted to use the following obscenities list of prohibited words a media file e.g. an audio file or an audio video file that includes the content that violates the rule s and or the corresponding transcribed content text e.g. the manager is doing a terrible job of hiring key players or the obscenity obtained from the speech recognition engine. The report may be provided to the requester the content submitter and or an operator associated with the verification entity. Optionally the verification process or portions thereof may be performed manually by a human although this may be a more time consuming and less accurate verification method and a human may not be able to process large numbers of rules or content or ensure rule consistency. Optionally the verification system and a human may together perform the verification. For example the verification system may generate the report which may be reviewed and or approved or disapproved by a human operator. By way of further example based on or more rules certain content may be automatically reviewed and certain content may be flagged for review or for further review by a human operator.

Optionally with respect to manual verification those that are not the verification entity are prevented from viewing the content unless and until the verification entity approves the content. Thus for example if the verification entity is a particular user or department e.g. a legal department or brand management department at a company that has been designated as a content verifier by the content requester other users at the company that are not designated as content verifiers are not permitted to view the content until the content verifier verifies the content.

A rules user interface may be provided to the content requester and or to a third party whose rules or guidelines the content needs to satisfy in order for the content to be broadcast published by the requester. The rules user interface may enable textual words and or phrases to be entered that correspond to prohibited phrases comprising one or more words or to permitted phrases. In addition or instead the rules user interface may enable a file containing an audio track of prohibited phrases and or permitted phrases to be loaded by the system. The rules may also indicate to which type of content provider e.g. based on the role profession of the content provider and or which type of requester the rules are to be applied to. For example different rules may be specified for players coaches managers and or team medical personnel. Further different rules may be applied for print publishing online distribution radio cable and or over the air television broadcasting. The rules may be evaluated using a rules engine which may be included in the verification system. The rules engine may be configured to register define classify define relationships between rules and or manage rules. The rules engine may optionally be configured to verify the consistency of rules definitions.

If an item of submitted content violates a rule the verification system may inhibit the content from being provided to the requester e.g. prevent the content from being forwarded or accessed by the content requester or the content may be provided to requester with an alert rule violation indication so that the requester is informed of the rules violation. For example the indication may optionally be provided via text e.g. this content has violated one or more rules an icon a color or otherwise. Optionally the verification system may notify the content submitter of the rule violation e.g. as discussed above and enable the content submitter to submit new or corrected content that complies with the violated rule s as well as the other rules. The new or corrected content will then be examined to ensure it complies with the rules as similarly discussed above.

Optionally the verification entity has a specified period of time to review submitted content where the time period may be specified by the publisher requester or the third party . Optionally if so specified by the requester e.g. publisher or authorized third party if the verification entity does not disapprove the content within the specified period of time the content is automatically considered approved and an approval indication and optionally access to the content is provided to the requester for publication e.g. print broadcast online other form of publication . This optional feature may be particularly helpful when the content is to be used in a near live feed e.g. for a television or radio broadcast of a game . For example the if the content submitter has been asked to comment on a play in a game being broadcast the approval time period may optionally be set to be very short e.g. less than 15 seconds less than 10 seconds or less than 1 second so that the comment can be broadcast very soon after the play took place. Optionally instead if so specified by the requester e.g. publisher or authorized third party if the verification entity does not approve the content within the specified period of time the content is automatically considered disapproved and is not provided to the content requester for publication and or a disapproval indication is provided to the requester. A countdown timer may optionally be generated and displayed to a verification operator to indicate a remaining time to approve or disapprove the content.

The verification system may maintain a queue of content that is awaiting verification. The verification system may optionally order the queue as a first in first out queue where the content is ordered so that the oldest first entry is processed first the next oldest entry is processed second and so on. The verification system may optionally order the queue based on a priority assigned by the content requester. For example the content requester may value content from a first content provider more than content from a second content provider and may specify that the content from the first content provider is to be verified before the content from the second content provider even if the second provider provided the content first. Optionally the verification system may present via a user interface e.g. to an operator the current content in the queue and the queue ordering. Once an item of content has been approved or disapproved the item of content may be removed from the queue of content to be verified.

Optionally a content provider can specify that his her content is to be verified prior to the content being provided to a publisher whether or not the content was specifically requested by the publisher or the content is being provided without being solicited by the publisher . Thus for example the content provider may specify rules as similarly discussed above with respect to the content requester and the content may be similarly verified by the verification entity. Optionally the verification system may enable the content provider to specify which verification entity is to perform the verification e.g. if the content provider is an actor the verification entity may be a publicist or management entity who is to ensure that the actor s content is not offensive to the actor s fans . Optionally those that are not the verification entity are prevented from viewing the content unless and until the verification entity approves the content. Thus for example if the verification entity is a particular user or department e.g. a legal department or brand management department at a company that has been designated as a content verifier other users at the company that are not designated as content verifiers are not permitted to view the content until the content verifier verifies the content.

Optionally with reference to the content requester may specify that responders to a particular request may view the content of other responders or of other specifically selected responders . The content distribution facilitation system may store such specification in memory. The content distribution facilitation system may then detect when content is received from a given responder block 1000A based at least in part on the specification determine which other responders are permitted to view such content block 1002A notify such other responders of the receipt of the content block 1004A and enable the other responders to view the content e.g. using a mobile device application or via a webpage block 1006A . Optionally the other responders are inhibited from downloading the content and may only view the content in streaming mode. Optionally the other responders are enabled to download the content.

Optionally a responder reviewing content from another responder can record a comment e.g. a video recording with an audio track an audio recording or a text comment regarding the viewed content and the comment may be provided to and published by the requester block 1006A . Another responder may in turn record a comment on the original comment and or on the content and so on. The content and comments may be linked and displayed in threaded fashion e.g. visually indicating the parent child relationship of the content block 1010A . The content requester may then select the content and one or more of the comments for publication. For example the content requester may optionally download the recorded content and publish the downloaded recorded content via a website broadcast television broadcast radio software applications by saving it to a file sharing service by publishing the content to a social media feed etc.

Optionally the requester may select a complete thread of content and comments for publication and a publication system may be configured to then publish the content e.g. video content audio content and or textual content in sequential or other order.

Optionally in the foregoing example rather than commenting on content submitted by another content provider an expert contributor may record a question for another expert contributor or for multiple experts contributors where a given expert may be requested to have already submitted content or where a given expert need not have already submitted content . The question and response s may be presented to the content requester in threaded fashion. As similarly discussed above a publication system may be configured to then publish the content e.g. video content audio content and or textual content in sequential selected or other order.

A given content contributor may have a profile. The profile may include some or all of the following information and or other information how much the content provider charges for different types of content e.g. editorial content such as news reporting opinion or commentary commercial content which may include incidental product placements and or endorsements wherein a given item of content may be paid or unpaid content and or may be provided under a previously existing contract and or different lengths of content the types of content the content provider is interested in creating fields of knowledge job history e.g. teams played for positions played hobbies personal interests age gender city of residence shows in which a given personality has been or will be part of the cast demographics of a given personality s fans what endorsements deals the personality has e.g. a sponsorship from an athletic wear or equipment company etc. The profile may have been created by the content contributor or by a content requester e.g. a publisher . The profile data may be stored in a searchable content contributor profile data store.

Optionally a content creator may have created a profile and a given content requester may add additional information to the content creator profile. Thus a first content requester may have access to a first version of the content contributor s profile where the first version includes the profile information provided by the content contributor and the customized information added by the first content requester. A second content requester may have access to a second version of the content contributor s profile where the second version also includes the profile information provided by the content contributor and includes customized information added by the second content requester. Optionally a given content requester may be prevented from accessing or viewing the customized portion of a profile entered by another content requester. Thus different versions of a profile for a given content provider may be presented to different content requesters. Further the search engine may be configured to limit a content provider profile search of a given content requester to only profile information accessible to all content requesters e.g. the portion of the profile entered by the content provider and to profile information entered by the given content requester.

Optionally a user interface is provided that enables a given content requester to specify whether other content requesters are to be provided with access customized profile information entered by the given content requester for a given content contributor. The sharing specification may be stored and used to determine who is permitted to access the customized portion of the given content contributor s profile.

Thus for example optionally a publisher e.g. a television network radio network web network newspaper etc. may store profiles of their actors correspondents personalities collectively referred to as personalities herein unless the context indicates otherwise . The profiles may indicate the personalities fields of knowledge their hobbies personal interests age gender shows in which a given personality has been or will be part of the cast demographics of a given personality s fans what endorsements deals the personality has e.g. a sponsorship from an athletic wear or equipment company etc. When an event occurs e.g. at a sporting event at a movie preview a new product release etc. the system may identify using a search engine appropriate personalities to provide commentary regarding the event.

For example a publisher may specify one or more desired personality characteristics. The characteristics may be specified in real time in response to the event or the characteristics may have been pre specified for the type of event where the specification may be saved as a content submitter search query. For example if the event is the winning of a baseball game by the Dodgers and the content is to be presented as part of a news alert on a television program directed to teenagers a personality search query may specify that the personality is to be between the ages of 13 and 19 be a fan of the Dodgers be an actor on a comedy series and be currently viewing the game e.g. based on the personality checking in via the mobile device application .

By way of further example if a publisher wishes to find a content contributor that played for a specific sports team or type of a specific college the publisher query may include the sports team name and or the sports team type e.g. women s basketball and or the college name.

Optionally the publisher may specify via the search user interface or via a publisher profile preferences user interface that the search results are to be limited to only those content contributors that the publisher has previously designated as acceptable. For example the publisher may have entered into a content supply agreement a contract with one or more content contributors. The publisher may want to limit the search results to only those content contributors that the publisher has such an active agreement with where the agreement is still in force . The publisher may be previously indicted via an uploaded list via a selection of contributors presented by the system or otherwise such acceptable personalities.

The search engine may then process the search query and identify from the stored profiles personalities or other content contributors that satisfy the query. As noted elsewhere herein a given profile may include information generally available to all content requesters and may include customized profile information that is only searchable and accessible by the content requester that provided the customized profile information. Thus the search may be limited to profile information that the publisher is permitted to search. A list of matching personalities or other content contributors may be presented to the publisher or other authorized entity . Optionally the search engine may be configured to execute incremental searches as a user enters query characters. For example the search engine may be configured to detect each character of query as it is being entered by the user and identify in substantially real time matches based on the current query term characters. Such an incremental search technique will often enable the user to find desired matching personalities or other content contributors without having to enter the entire personality query.

Optionally an interface is provided via which the user e.g. a publisher or other content requester can select one or more of the personalities or other content contributors included in the search results and save them as a list with a list name assigned by the user. For example if the search was for former Dodgers catchers the user can select some or all of the personalities or other content contributors returned by the search engine and save the selection in a list entitled Former Dodgers catchers . The user can then access and select this list or a subset of the list personality entries for future content requests. Optionally when conducting a search if the publisher has predefined sets of content contributors the publisher may instruct the system to limit the search to those content contributors in one or more specified predefined sets of content contributors. Optionally the system restricts a given content requester s access to content contributors to a subset of content contributors. The restriction may be defined by a system operator as specified by respective content contributors and or according to defined rules e.g. a rule may specify that athletes are accessible to all requesters associated with a media publisher . Thus results of a search conducted by a content requester may optionally be limited to those content contributors to which the requester is permitted access to by the system and will not include those content contributors to which the requester is not permitted access to.

The system may then automatically or in response to a selection by the publisher transmit the content request to one or more of the matching personalities or other content contributors. Optionally a content submitter e.g. a user responding to a content request is prevented from submitting content during certain specified times of days or from certain specified locations. Optionally a content submitter is prevented from submitting content recorded during certain specified times of days or recorded at certain specified locations. Optionally instead when a content submitter submits content during certain specified times of days or from certain specified locations an alert indication is stored in association with the content and such content is subjected to a more thorough verification and or the content is not automatically approved even if a specified approval period has expired. An operator may specify such time periods and or locations via a user interface and the system may store the specification in memory. The operator may also specify one or more rules for how the content is to be processed if the content is being submitted and or recorded within the specified time period and or within the specified location e.g. a geographical and or named location such as a stadium or restaurant . For example the operator may specify that such content be prevented from being submitted and or published or that such content be subject to a higher level of scrutiny and verification e.g. operator verification .

When a content submitter or other content submitter attempts to submit content the system may access the specifications and determine from metadata associated with the content e.g. time and or location data such as GPS data whether the content is being submitted within and or recorded within the specified time period and or location.

For example it may be determined that content providers submitting content between 12 00 AM and 4 00 AM often appear drowsy or may appear to be inebriated. Therefore such content may often be undesirable and so may as a rule automatically be prevented from being submitted and or published or may be subject to a higher level of scrutiny and verification. Optionally if content being submitted has an associated recording timestamp the system may determine whether the timestamp falls within the specified period of time and if so the content may automatically be prevented from being submitted and or published or may be subject to a higher level of scrutiny and verification.

Similarly certain locations may be considered potentially undesirable. For example it may be undesirable to have certain types of content recorded in a bar or at an adult entertainment venue because if the content includes a video track the bar or adult entertainment venue may be viewed in the background and if the content includes an audio track inappropriate language may be recorded. By way of further example it may be undesirable to have content recorded at a venue associated with a competitor of the content requester publisher. Therefore such content may be undesirable and so may as a rule automatically be prevented from being submitted and or published or may be subject to a higher level of scrutiny and verification. Optionally if content being submitted has an associated recording timestamp the system may determine whether the timestamp falls within the specified period of time and if so the content may automatically be prevented from being submitted and or published or may be subject to a higher level of scrutiny and verification.

As discussed above a content submitter may be compensated for providing content. Optionally the compensation may be timed event based. For example if the content is received during a live sporting event broadcast where the content may be used the responder may receive a relatively higher level than if the content is received after the live sporting event for use in a news report reporting on the sporting event. Optionally a responder may receive a relatively lower compensation for providing the content if the content is submitted in response to the request but is not accepted. Optionally if the content is not accepted by the requester within a specified period of time the ability of the requester to accept the content may expire and the content may be offered to others on an exclusive or non exclusive basis. For example if the content is not accepted by the requester within a specified period of time the system may offer the content to other potential users e.g. media partners optionally with a designated acceptance period. Once that acceptance period passes without a purchase by such a media partner or if the responder indicated that they do not want the content offered to other media partners then the content may be automatically published out to social media e.g. a microblog a blog a social network page etc. some or all of which may be hosted by the system or by third party systems. For example the system may host a website where a given responder content contributor e.g. an athlete or celebrity is provided a page or site where the content provided in a response as well as other content e.g. videos photos text conversations may be posted in association with ads or sponsorships enabling richer fan interactions and generating revenue for such content providers.

Optionally the requester may specify different amounts of compensation for different response times. For example the requester may specify that the responder will receive 500 if the response is received within 5 minutes of the request being submitted 300 if the response is received between 6 30 minutes of the request being submitted and 150 if the response is received between 31 minutes and 4 hours of the request being submitted. In this example the requester may specify that the offer expires if the content is not received within 4 hours of the request being submitted. In addition to or instead of specifying relative time the request may specify absolute time periods. For example requester may specify that the responder will receive 500 if the response is received by 1 15 PM 300 if the response is received between 1 16 PM 1 45 PM and 150 if the response is received between 1 46 PM and 5 45 PM.

Optionally a point system may be used in addition to or instead of the currency payment system described herein. For example a responder may be awarded a first set of points e.g. 5 points or other number of points for submitting a response to a requester e.g. video audio and or text media and may be awarded a second number of points e.g. 3 to 10 times as many points as the first number of points if the requester uses the submitted response e.g. by broadcasting it via television radio webpage SMS message or email . Optionally the system may enable the responder to convert the points to an item of value such as currency a gift card a product and or a service. Optionally some or all of the items of value may be provisioned by a sponsor seeking to advertise their product and or service. For example a golf equipment company may provide golfing equipment which the responder would purchase via the system or otherwise using points. The sponsor may obtain the benefit of having a well known responder e.g. a well known athlete use their product and or service and may optionally be entitled to identify via advertisements or otherwise that the responder uses the sponsor s products and or services. Optionally the sponsor may specify that in order to receive the item of value the responder needs to include the item in a video response that includes the responder e.g. for product placement . Optionally the responder may need to have at least a threshold amount of points in order to exchange the points for an item of value. Optionally a given point may be assigned a certain currency value e.g. each point or each 10 points equal one dollar .

The requester may be provided with an exclusive right to utilize the accepted content for a specified time period or indefinitely number of views and or for one or more specified distribution channels e.g. television radio print etc. . For example the length of exclusivity may be based on the fee wherein the relatively larger the fee for a given item of content the relatively longer the period of exclusivity. Optionally once the period of exclusivity ends the content may be automatically published via one or more other publication channels and or control of the content may be transferred to the system operator or to the content contributor For example the content or a portion thereof may automatically be published on a micro blogging site a conventional blog a social networking site via email via short messaging service message and or otherwise. Optionally at least partly in response to the expiration of the exclusivity or a date related thereto a notification is posted on a social networking site associated with the publisher and or the content contributor or elsewhere regarding the loss of exclusivity and or indicating with text a link or otherwise where else the content can now be found e.g. on the content contributor s social network page . Instead or in addition the notification may be provided via a microblog text message email or otherwise. Optionally once the requester has published the content the content contributor may be enabled to immediately or after a specified period of time repost the content or a link to the content via a micro blogging site a conventional blog a social networking site via email via short messaging service message and or otherwise. Optionally the system may enable the content contributor to post the content e.g. to a social media page associated with the content contributor whether or not the requester has published the content e.g. substantially immediately after the content is submitted by the content contributor . Optionally the system will inhibit the content contributor from posting the content until approval is received from the content requester. For example the system may automatically or in response to a content contributor request transmit an approval request to the content requester in response to receiving content and upon receiving approval from the content requester enable the content contributor to post the content.

The publication channels may be associated with the responder and or the system operator. For example the content may be published on the contributor s social networking page and or microblog after the exclusivity expiration. Advertising e.g. from sponsors that pay a fee may be provided on such a site where the revenue may be shared by the responder and the content distribution facilitation system. During the period of exclusivity the system may ensure that the accepted content is not distributed via the system to other requesters during the period. Optionally when an exclusivity period expires a notification may be transmitted by the system to the requester and to the corresponding responder regarding the expiration of the exclusivity.

Optionally the requester is not granted exclusive rights. Optionally the requester is assigned ownership of the content.

For example if during a live sporting event such as a baseball game a notable event occurs e.g. a player hitting four home runs in a game a record breaking event a unusual event a notable statistic etc. a broadcaster of the live event may want to request that other players that have achieved the same feat provide commentary regarding the feat while the game is still in progress to enhance the excitement of the game broadcast and to add a social networking aspect to the game broadcast. The broadcaster may submit via a user interface provided by the system a request for such commentary during the game e.g. almost immediately after the event occurred and may specify that the query is to be directed to athletes and in particular to other players that have previously achieved the feat. The request may specify the subject that the athlete is to discuss e.g. how they feel regarding another athlete achieving the feat . The requester may also specify a response deadline the media type for the response e.g. video including an audio track static images e.g. photographs audio only track text etc. and other response criteria via the user interface. For example the response criteria may specify a response length.

Optionally potential responders may have an application or application programming interface API installed on their devices that detect certain actions being performed by the responders. For example the application may detect in real time if a responder is viewing a program such as a sporting event and may identify which program is being watched and may transmit such detection to the content distribution facilitation system. Optionally the application prompts the potential responder to indicate e.g. by tapping on a corresponding control or otherwise that he or she is or is not watching a specific program and the application will cause the indication to be transmitted to the content distribution facilitation system. Optionally with or without being requested by a particular content requester or by the application the potential responder may check in via an application wherein the check in indicates which event the potential responder plans on or is currently attending e.g. a particular baseball game or viewing. The potential responder may in addition or instead check in to a particular publisher e.g. a particular network . The requester may specify that the request is to be provided to potential responders that are currently watching a specified program. For example the request may specify that the responder is to comment on an event that just took place in the program e.g. hitting of a home run or a triple play . Optionally if the request includes a response deadline one or more reminder notifications may be generated and provided to the potential responder via the application. For example the a reminder may be generated two hours before the deadline expiration one hour before the deadline expiration and 30 minutes before the deadline expiration. Optionally a content submitter can submit content unprompted. For example optionally the content submitted can submit content for a live feed.

Optionally in addition to or instead of requesting a recorded submission the requester may request that a responder participate in a live interview discussion either substantially immediately e.g. within 1 minute 5 minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes or 1 hour of the request or at some specified date time e.g. Sep. 30 2013 at 11 00 AM . One or more responders may agree to the request and the requester may engage one or more of such responders. Optionally a responder may participate in the interview discussion using the responder s mobile device e.g. mobile telephone camera and or microphone to capture video and or voice. Other devices such as a desktop computer laptop computer tablet computer television game console etc. that are coupled to a camera and or microphone may be used to capture the responder s video and or voice and to transmit them in substantially real time e.g. with less than a second lag via the system described herein or other system. Likewise the responder device may be used to receive video and audio from the requester enabling the requester and responder to engage in an audio video discussion.

By way of illustration if the response is to be a video or audio response the request may specify the minimum and or maximum time length of the response and if the response is text the request may specify minimum and or maximum number of words and or characters. By way of further example if the response is video or a still image the response criteria may include orientation e.g. landscape or portrait which may be selected based at least in part to the target content reproduction device e.g. television sets phones tablet computers desktop computers etc. and or desired resolution of the video and or image quality.

The requester may also indicate a desired period of time of exclusivity and or a desired exclusive form of distribution. Corresponding fees may be specified by the system to the requester for different lengths of exclusivity and or avenues of distribution. Optionally the requester may specify the fees the requester is willing to pay for the same as part of the request criteria. Optionally no fee is to be paid by the requester. For example a potential responder may wish to provide content as a form of self promotion even in the absence of a fee. Optionally a requester e.g. a publisher may have pre negotiated an arrangement with one or more content contributors to provide content e.g. without any fee with a fixed fee for an event or period of time with a per item of content fee and or a fee for each item of content used on an exclusive or a non exclusive basis. For example a publisher may have retained a content contributor to provide a specified number of items of content over a specified time period or for a specific event on a non exclusive basis without a fee. By way of further example a publisher may have retained a content contributor to provide content without specifying the number of items over a specified time period on an exclusive basis for a specified fee.

Using the requester criteria the system may search its database of potential responders such as athletes actors celebrities experts designers artists musicians etc. for potential responders whose stored profiles match the requester criteria and that have agreed to receive such requests. For example the database may include profiles of athletes such as baseball players which may include various statistics events and achievements from some or all of the games they have played in including those that result from an aggregation of achievements over multiple games such as how many games the player has played in a row or how may games in a row the player has hit a home run . The system may transmit the request to matching potential responders where the request may include some or all of the requester specified response criteria. By way of example the request may be transmitted to a potential responder via email short messaging service e.g. SMS MMS etc. instant messaging service an application sometimes referred to as an app downloaded to or otherwise installed on a potential recipient device e.g. a mobile phone tablet computer entertainment device etc. and or otherwise. For example as noted above the notification may be provided as an in app notification by an application installed on the responder s mobile phone tablet computer or entertainment device.

Optionally a given potential responder that receives the request may record the content requested via a mobile device such as a phone. For example a phone application may be configured to both present the request and enable the recording of the response content optionally at the same time. By way of illustration if the request includes a request for video content of the recipient the application may activate a front facing camera of the phone and present a user interface on the phone display showing the image being captured by the front facing camera where the request may be displayed at the same time. A record control may be provided. When the recipient activates the record control a recording of the recipient e.g. discussing the subject matter included in the request is initiated. A timer e.g. a countdown counter may be presented while the recording is in process which may count down a time corresponding to the requested length of the video content. For example the request transmitted to the user phone application may include the requested length and the application may load the timer with a corresponding time. Optionally once the timer has reached a certain value e.g. 0 the recording may be automatically halted by the application. Optionally instead the recording may continue until the recipient activates a stop or pause control optionally an indication is provided that the recording has exceeded the requested length . The recorded content may be transmitted to the content distribution facilitation system or the content distribution facilitation system may otherwise access the content.

Optionally a content item may be divided into subsets or chunks for transmission to reduce the probability of an error occurring during transmission of the content item and having to re transmit the entire content item again. By way of example a chunk may be packetized for transmission over a packet network e.g. an IP network and may include verification data e.g. a checksum . If the receiving system detects an error with respect to a chunk e.g. a failure to receive the corresponding packet or a defect in the received packet it may transmit a request to the system that sent the packet to resend that packet chunk.

Optionally the application may continue transmitting a content item to the content distribution facilitation system even when the application is running in the background after the content contributor has finished interacting with the application and the application is no longer being displayed.

Thus one or more responses including requested content or links thereto may be provided by the requested recipients. The responses may be received by content distribution facilitation system. The content distribution facilitation system may forward the responses to the requester or otherwise notify the requester and enable the requester to access the responses. For example a user interface provided by the content distribution facilitation system to the requester via a requester terminal may display a listing of responses from which the requester can select. Optionally a watermark may be embedded in the content provided to the requester for review to prevent or discourage the use of the content until accepted by the requester and or paid for by the requester. For example with respect to video or image content the watermark may be visual. With respect to audio content the watermark may be audible. The content may be provided without the watermark once accepted by the requester.

In an example embodiment the requester may access the responses via a list presented in a web page provided for display by the system via a dedicated software application or otherwise. The requester may click on a control such as a view control presented in association with a respective response entry and the corresponding response is presented e.g. presented as text video and or audio . The requester may then provide via a user interface an indication of acceptance of one or more of the responses. The acceptance may be recorded by the system and the system may then charge or invoice the requester for the accepted responses. The accepted response may then be automatically downloaded to the requester system or the accepted response may be downloaded in response to receiving a specific download instruction from the requester via the requester system .

Optionally an interface may be provided enabling the requester to specify reasons as to why the requester did not accept a given response e.g. the video quality was poor the camera was shaky the sound quality was poor the content was uninteresting the content included objectionable content e.g. obscene language racist language etc. . A notification may be transmitted to the responders indicating acceptance or non acceptance of respective responses optionally including reasons for non acceptance provided by the requester and a confirmation of the acceptance may be transmitted to the requester.

Optionally content not accepted by the requester may then be offered to others for use on an exclusive or non exclusive basis e.g. where the requester affirmatively specifies that the content is not accepted or a predetermined period of time elapses without an acceptance by the requester and so the content is designated by the system as not accepted . For example other potential licensees purchasers of the content may be provided by the system with a search interface where they can enter search queries to identify content they may be interested in. By way of further example such interface may include fields enabling a searcher to specify subject matter criteria e.g. home runs author criteria e.g. a pitcher content specifications e.g. format length type e.g. audio video audio only images etc. availability of exclusive rights and or other criteria discussed herein with respect to requester specified criteria. The system may then return matching search results if any with an associated control enabling the searcher to specify they want to licensee purchase a given item of content identified in the search results. Optionally the responder may correct the issue s identified by the requester and may resubmit the corrected content which the requester may or may not accept as similarly described above

After the requester has accepted and received the content e.g. via a download to the requester system the requester may publish the accepted content accordingly e.g. in a television program radio program online news program etc. . Optionally the requester may inform the system where e.g. which channel station online media URL etc. and when e.g. time and date the content will be published and the system will cause a notification to be presented to potential consumers indicating where and when they can find and view and or listen to the content. Optionally such a notification is posted on a social networking site associated with the publisher and or the content contributor indicating with text a link or otherwise where and when the content can be found. Instead or in addition the notification may be provided via a microblog text message email or otherwise by the system content provider and or publisher. Optionally in addition to or instead of the link the content itself may be posted.

Optionally an editing application may be provided to enable manual and or automatic editing of content via a web based application or an application hosted on the requester s system. For example a user interface may be provided via which the requester can requests that specified edits may be to the content. For example the application may be configured to perform one or more of the following trim the duration of the video to a specified length by trimming the video on one or both ends add pre roll or post roll bumpers where a bumper is a short video clip e.g. 5 15 seconds in duration and or adding watermarks overlaid onto an image or video included in the content.

Further non limiting examples of the type of criteria that may be specified by a requester will now be described. A user interface may be provided enabling the user to specify by way of example 

By way of further illustration an online newspaper or other news site may be publishing an article regarding a crime such as a murder. The publisher may want audio commentary regarding the crime from a psychologist. The publisher may submit a request to the system for audio content of a specified length commenting on the subject of the crime from a psychologist having an expertise in criminal psychology. The system may identify psychologists meeting the publisher s criteria and transmit the request to some or all of the identified psychologists. Optionally in addition or instead the publisher may specify select a particular content contributor via a user interface to whom the request is to be transmitted. The responses including audio content may be received by the system and made available to the publisher e.g. via a website dedicated application or otherwise . The publisher may listen to the audio content from several or all of the responses from the psychologists. The publisher may accept a response. The publisher may then embed in the article a link to the audio content. A user can then read the article and activate the link in order to hear the audio content.

An application programming interface may be provided enabling third party systems to gain access to some or all of the services provided by the content distribution facilitation system. The operator of a third system may pay a licensing fee for such access.

The operator of the system may utilize one or more fee arrangements to obtain compensation for the services provided and to reimburse the fees paid to content providers. By way of example publishers may pay a periodic subscription fee in order to utilize the system and obtain the right e.g. the exclusive right for a least a period of time to utilize content provided by content providers e.g. athletes celebrities medical personal etc. and accepted by the requester. Optionally the subscription service may only enable the requester to issue requests for and or accept a specified number of items of content within a specified period of time e.g. the requester may only be permitted to submit requests per month .

Compensation may also be received from sponsors and advertisers. Optionally a content contributor responding to a request may be compensated in whole or in part via compensation sponsored by a third party e.g. that wants to advertise its goods services or brand name . For example a contributor may be given a gift card which may be a new gift card or a recharge of value of a gift card previously distributed to the contributor for each submission or for a specified number of submissions the gift card provided in association with an advertisement from a sponsor that is paying for all or a portion of the gift card value.

Optionally in addition or instead the content contributor may be provided with a portion of the revenue from a sponsor sponsoring a show newspaper or other medium using and distributing the content. For example if the content is a 1 minute video of an athlete content contributor being displayed during a broadcast of a live game the video may be introduced as this minute of baseball starring John Smith is presented by sponsor name . The sponsor may pay to have their brand associated with the video and the athlete may receive some or all of the sponsorship fees. Optionally the content contributor may be paid a fixed amount. Optionally certain requesters e.g. companies may request the responder e.g. a celebrity such as an athlete or actor to perform product placement acts and compensate the responder accordingly. For example a company may request and pay a fee for certain celebrities to say Happy Mother s Day while holding a food product provided by the company. By way of further example certain requesters e.g. companies may request that the responder include the requester s logo e.g. via a watermark or otherwise into videos submitted by the responder in response to a request from the requester offering payment for inclusion of the logo and or to requests from other requesters and or for videos distributed by one or more specified media partners. The logo may be provided by the requester and inserted by the responder the system or otherwise.

Optionally the amount if any the content contributor is paid for his or her contribution may vary and may be determined based on one or more of the following factors and or other factors 

Optionally a requester can request items other than publishable content. For example a requester may specify that they want a specific type of item of memorabilia from a specific potential responder and or from a responder selected from a group of responders that satisfy the requester s criteria. As similarly described above the criteria may be specified via a user interface provided by the system. For example the requester may request a signed baseball from a specific baseball player or the requester may request a signed baseball from any current player on a specified baseball team. The requester may also specify a time frame in which the memorabilia needs to be received by the requester. For example the requester may want to ensure that the memorabilia is received by a designated gift recipient in time for the gift recipient s birthday.

The system may access its database to identify potential responders that satisfy the requester criteria and transmit the request to some or all of the identified potential responders. If a potential responder accepts the request the system may receive the acceptance and notify other potential responders that the request has been taken and is no longer available to service. The responder that accepted the request then provides the requested memorabilia to the requester. A fixed fee may be specified for different types of memorabilia or the requester may specify in the request how much they are willing to pay for the memorabilia and the potential responder may determine whether they want to satisfy the request based at least in part on the fee amount. The responder is correspondingly compensated and the requester is correspondingly charged.

The foregoing process may be similarly performed by the system for other types of requests. For example a requester may request that a specific potential responder e.g. a specified athlete musical performer actor celebrity etc. or a potential responder satisfying criteria specified by the user provide a recorded video of the potential responder singing happy birthday wherein the rendition of happy birthday is to include the recitation of a specified recipient of the video e.g. a boy or girl whose birthday it is . By way of further example the request may be a request to answer a question by the requester e.g. regarding a statistic opinion e.g. who was the best play at a specified position or a personal fact of the potential responder. Optionally the request may include text that the responder is to recite in the response e.g. where the text may include the name of a host of a show on which the content is to be used such as Hello Joe let me tell you what I think of the last play . . . . Such requests and responses may be processed as similarly discussed above and the content may be provided to the requester and or directly to a specified gift recipient e.g. via a video download file streaming media a DVD or otherwise .

Optionally the system enables users e.g. celebrities athletes etc. to create unsolicited content and offer the content to potential content consumers e.g. publishers individual end users etc. . The user may tag the content with appropriate descriptors. For example the tags may indicate the media type the media length the media content subject matter the user s credentials and or resume information e.g. the user s profession awards notable accomplishments area of expertise etc. the use fee etc. The user may also specify specific users e.g. producers or broadcasters of specific television shows and or specific types of users e.g. producers or broadcasters of sports programs to whom the content offer is to be made. The content offer may then be sent out to the potential consumer s as specified by the user.

Optionally the user content contributor . a requester e.g. publisher and or system operator may be able to specify that a given user is to be accessible only to one requester or to a specified set or classes of requesters Optionally the accessibility restrictions may be limited to one or more specified subject areas e.g. sports movies television music medicine legal matters etc. for a specific event e.g. a particular sports tournament game or trial and or may be limited to a specific period of time e.g. one year a specific sports season etc. . The system will then store such accessibility information in the user profile information and or elsewhere. Optionally the user will be excluded from search results presented to other content requesters during such an exclusivity period or event and or for requests related to the subject matter for which there is exclusivity. Optionally if a requester e.g. publisher indicates some form of exclusivity with respect to a user content contributor the system will transmit a communication e.g. an email text message web page notification etc. to the user content contributor asking for confirmation. If the user confirms the requester specified exclusivity then the system will store the exclusivity information in association with the user profile information with an indication that the exclusivity information is in force. If the user content contributor responds with an exclusivity denial optionally the system will not store the exclusivity indication in association with the user profile information with an indication that the exclusivity information is in force. Optionally in response to such a denial indication the system will transmit a notification to the requester regarding the exclusivity denial.

Optionally when a requester submits a search query for content contributors the system will determine if a given content contributor is exclusive to another requester e.g. based on time period event and or subject matter . If the system determines that the given content contributor is exclusive to another requester the system will exclude that content contributor from the search results returned by the system. Optionally when a requester submits a search query for content contributors the system will determine if the requester has been granted access to a given content contributor. If the system determines that the requester has not been given access to a given content contributor the system will exclude that content contributor from the search results returned by the system.

Optionally a requester e.g. a publisher may make an arrangement e.g. with the system operator to make one or more content contributors exclusive based on content contributor characteristics e.g. profession team player position player statistics awards won location gender age profession expertise other characteristics disclosed herein etc. rather than based on the identity of the content contributors. For example a publisher may request exclusivity with respect to all former players of a specified team for a specified game optionally without specifying specific player names.

Optionally prior to storing the new exclusivity information with an indication that the exclusivity information is in force in association with the profile information for a given content contributor the system will inspect and validate that the new exclusivity information specified for the given content provider does not conflict with previously specified exclusivity information that is still in force. For example the system may compare the previously specified exclusivity information from a first content requester with the newly specified exclusivity information from a second content requester to determine if there is an impermissible overlap in subject areas events and or time period. If there is an overlap a message may be generated and transmitted to the content requester that provided the new exclusivity information the message indicating that the new exclusivity information is in conflict with previous in force exclusivity information and that the new exclusivity information will not be approved. In the event of such conflicting overlap the system will not store the new exclusivity information with an indication that the exclusivity information is in force in association with the profile information for the given content contributor.

Optionally the system may access accounts of potential consumers of the content and determine if the potential content consumers have requested to be notified when content that meets specified criteria has become available for publishing. The system may compare the specified criteria from one or more potential content consumers with the tags and if there is a sufficient match and optionally only if the potential consumers match the user s criteria notify potential content consumers of the content which they may accept or not accept as similarly described above and for which compensation may be paid as similarly discussed above.

For example an athlete may want to make a significant announcement by recording a video offering it via the system to different media partners. Optionally rather than offering an already recorded video the athlete offer may state a subject regarding which the athlete is willing to provide content on. For example if an athlete was recently in an accident which ended his professional playing career the offer may be an offer to record a video where the athlete would discuss his feelings and health. The offer may specify a price format e.g. encoding type e.g. MP4 AVI MOV etc. number of pixels in the height and width dimensions etc. and or length.

Optionally the system includes a bidding engine enabling potential content consumers to bid on the content or the offer to record the content . The auction winner s rights may include exclusive access to the content time limited exclusive access distribution limited access and non exclusive rights.

If the offer is an offer to record content an accepting media partner may specify a length format and content details that the media partner expects or requires with respect to the content to be recorded by the athlete. Optionally the athlete may refuse the media partner s acceptance if the requirements set forth by the media partner are not acceptable to the athlete.

The system operator may in certain embodiments retain or be paid a percentage of a fee paid by requester or a sponsor or a flat fee for the use of a given item of content or a certain number of content items. The system operator may in certain embodiments be paid a portion of advertising and or sponsorship fees associated with the use of an item of content. The content contributors may optionally specify charities or other non profits to which some or all of the compensation due to the contributor may be contributed.

Optionally the system operator may submit requests to potential responders on its own behalf where the system operator may act as a publisher. For example the system operator may submit a question to multiple athletes regarding an event e.g. identify and discuss the most satisfying pitch you have thrown and assemble content from some or all the responses into a single item of content. The system operator may then license the assembled content and or the individual responses to a third party and or post the assembled content and or the individual responses on a site such as a publically accessible website.

Certain embodiments may track how many items of content a given user has submitted and or how many items of submitted content have been accepted. Such contributing users may be ranked based on such tracked information and the rankings may be published via social media e.g. social network blog etc. or otherwise. This may incentivize users to increase their content contributions and the quality of their content contributions.

Referring to an example process is illustrated. At state profile information for potential contributors is received and stored in a database as similarly described above. At state account information for potential content publishers is received and stored e.g. publisher name content information payment related information e.g. a payment source identifier such as a credit card or deposit account etc. . At state a request for content from a content publisher is received at a system. As discussed above the request may include criteria describing responders and or may specify particular selected responders that should be targeted with the request e.g. an athlete that had achieved a specified milestone and the type of content desired e.g. a 2 minute video wherein the athlete describes his feels at achieving the milestone . The request may specify a deadline for providing a response the amount of compensation that will be paid a desired period of exclusivity the type of use to which the content will be put and or other information. The request may include content such as a video file or image or a link to a video file or image that responders are requested to provide comments on e.g. in the form of video comments in their submission. For example the video file may include a segment from a sporting event e.g. a knockout in a boxing match or a television show e.g. a statement from a guest on a talk show that the responders are being requested to provide comments on. For example the system operator may create a channel on a third party site that hosts video content.

By way of example a media request user interface may be provided to a potential content publisher. The user interface may ask to identify a field of interest e.g. sports entertainment etc. . If for example the content publisher selects sports a menu of sports sports leagues may be presented to the content publisher from which the content publisher may select. For example the menu may list MLB NBA NFL NHL and or other sports leagues. Based at least in part on the league sports selection the system may optionally select a sport attributes user interface to display to the publisher. For example the sport attributes user interface may list teams corresponding to the selected league player positions corresponding to the league sport e.g. baseball player positions football player positions etc. non player professions e.g. agent coach scout medical etc. from which the publisher may select. The publisher s selections may then be received and stored by the system as request criteria. Optionally the publisher may also have previously defined a favorites list of experts. A user interface may optionally be provided to the publisher listing the favorites that meet some or all of the other request criteria specified by the publisher where the publisher can select one or more of the favorites to whom the request should be sent to.

At state the system utilizes at least a portion of the requester specified criteria to identify profiles of potential contributors in the database that sufficiently match and or receives the selection of particular contributors by the requester to access their profiles. At state the content request is transmitted to the identified matching potential contributors and or the requester selected contributors. At state responses are received by the system from one or more potential contributors. The content may optionally be stored with tags corresponding to some or all of the request criteria e.g. sport position player team etc. time stamped e.g. with date time of receipt and assigned a state of pending . At state the publisher is provided access to the response s including the content. The content may be watermarked before providing the publisher access to the content. At state the system receives a selection and acceptance of at least one response from the publisher. At state the system optionally transmits a notification acceptance to the corresponding responder and optionally assigns the content a status of complete . At state the responder whose content was accepted is optionally compensated and the publisher is charged for the content. Optionally the system operator also receives compensation as similarly described above. The publisher may then be provided the content without the watermark e.g. as a download file a link via streaming media or otherwise . At state a determination is optionally made as to whether the period of exclusivity has ended. If the period of exclusivity has ended optionally the content may be published via a social media platform and or offered to other publishers for publication.

At block verification routing information is specified. For example the routing information may specify a verification operator that may review the content or double check the results of an automatic verification process as described herein.

The content may be received indirectly such as from a cloud based storage system. Thus for example the user device may be equipped with an application configured to upload content to the cloud based system via an API. The content distribution facilitation system or the content requester system may then download the content from the cloud based storage system via an API using an application hosted on the content distribution facilitation system or the content requester system. This technique may reduce peak network bandwidth loading and or local storage requirements. Optionally instead the content may be received and stored by the content distribution facilitation system and the content distribution facilitation system may provide the content requester with a user interface enabling the content requester to download the content to a content requester system or may instruct the system to upload the content to a cloud based storage system in association with an account of the content requester. The content requester may then access the content from the cloud based system at a later time using a content requester system.

At block the system identifies the user the content requester the content verifier responsible for performing or for double checking the verification and or the channel s of publication e.g. print publication broadcast television broadcast radio internet media cable television cable radio satellite radio etc. . For example the user may be identified from information transmitted in conjunction with the content such as the user s email address metadata transmitted by a dedicated application used to transmit the content information provided by the user or the user browser e.g. if the content is uploaded via a browser or otherwise. The content requester and or channel s of publication may be identified from metadata provided by the system to a dedicated application e.g. wherein the dedicated application used to transmit the content to the system along with the metadata previously received from the system to the system from information provided by the user or the user browser e.g. if the content is uploaded via a browser or otherwise.

At block the system uses the identification of the user the content requester the content verifier and or the channels of publication to identify and locate the corresponding applicable rules and prohibited and or permitted content specifications e.g. from a data store such as a rules subject and phrases database . At block a determination is made as to whether the content complies with the corresponding rules. For example if the user submitting content is an athlete on a professional sports team and the requester is a sports network and the publication channel is cable television the rules may specify that the content is not to be accepted if it includes subject matter identified as prohibited in the prohibited content specifications. If the content does comply with the rules then at block the system enables the content requester to publish the content.

If at block a determination is made that the content does not comply with one or more rules then the process proceeds to block and a report is generated that identifies the portion s of the content that do not comply with respective rules. The report may include content text text transcribed from an audio track included in the content images from the content audio content video content bookmarks or time stamps for audio content and or video content and or other information that identifies content that does not comply with the rules. The report may optionally include the entire content with the non complying portions identified e.g. via color highlighting identifiers in a video or audio scrubber for video or audio content etc. . The rules which a given portion of content violates may be identified e.g. via a textual statement of the rule via a corresponding icon via a rule alphanumeric identifier or otherwise . At block a non compliance notification and or a copy or a link to the report is provided to one or more recipients e.g. as specified by the rules . For example the non compliance notification and or access to the report may be provided to the user that submitted the content to the content requester and or to the authorized third party if such exists .

If the notification and access to the report is provided to the user that submitted the content then optionally the user may be offered the opportunity of resubmitting the corrected content or new content in order to attempt to comply with the rules. At block the process determines whether the user resubmitted the content. If the user does resubmit the content then the content may go through the verification process. Otherwise the process may end.

Referring to an example environment and architecture is illustrated. A content distribution facilitation system includes a data store storing profiles of potential content contributors as similarly described above. The content distribution facilitation system may be configured to perform some or all of the functions and processes described above such as those discussed with respect to . The content distribution facilitation system may be coupled over a wired and or wireless network to one or more publisher systems and from which content requests may be received and to which content responses from content contributors may be provided. The content distribution facilitation system may include or may access a search engine. The search engine may be configured to identify potential content contributions based on their profiles geographical location presence at an event and or other criteria. The content distribution facilitation system may include or may access a speech recognition engine which may optionally be configured to utilize natural language processing. The speech recognition engine may utilize natural language processing. The content distribution facilitation system may include a content queue for content that is to be reviewed as similarly discussed elsewhere herein. A content contributor system may be in the form of a mobile phone with a camera and a browser and or application installed to access the user interfaces discussed above to record requested content and to provide the recorded content to the content distribution facilitation system . The recorded content may then be published by a publisher system and viewed by a user such as a fan via a user terminal which may be a computer television or other terminal type.

Referring now to an example interface is illustrated enabling a user to register as a potential responder. The user interface includes fields configured to receive some or all of the following the user s name email address mobile phone number microblog user name for Twitter in this example a preference indication for how the user wants to be contacted e.g. email SMS phone etc. the user s profession expertise e.g. sports entertainment etc. and location e.g. where the user can enter high level location information such as North America South America Europe etc. . The information received by the user may then be stored by the system. As described elsewhere herein the location and profession information may be used by the system to determine which users should be sent a given request for content.

If the user indicated via the user interface illustrated in that the user is an non player but is involved in the sports field then a user interface may be provided asking the user to select a sport as similarly described above with respect to . For example a menu may be provided that presents certain sports and or sports leagues from which the user may select. A user interface may be provided asking the user to identify a non player profession e.g. by selected from a dropdown menu from a set of professions such as official agent medical coach scout management family journalist celebrity fan e.g. a movie star analyst family grounds crew owner referee umpire scout etc. and optionally in what years for one or more of the teams selected via the user interface illustrated in .

If the user indicated via the user interface of that the user s profession is entertainment the system may select an entertainment user interface to be presented to the user to collect additional information. For example a menu may be presented asking the user to indicate what type of entertainer the user is e.g. actor musician comedian singer director producer agent etc. . The information received by the user may then be stored by the system.

Optionally when the responder activates the record button to initiate a video recording the request question and or text that the request instructs the responder to recite is positioned sized and or segmented by the application to be positioned near the responder device s camera lens. This will cause the responder s eyes to be looking at the lens region when reading questions and or text resulting in a better video. Optionally the application will only display one or two lines of text at a time the question text and or the text the responder is asked to recite adjacent to the lens e.g. just below the lens to better ensure that the responder s eyes are continuously directed to the camera lens area during the video recording. If the text is too long to display on one line or two lines adjacent to the lens the application may advance the text by scrolling the next portion of the text onto the device s display and scrolling off the previous portion of the text to ensure the next displayed text is also displayed adjacent to the lens. The scrolling or other technique for changing the text may be performed in response to detecting a responder text advance command automatically based on a desired pace of reading or otherwise. Optionally the responder may specify whether scrolling is to be enabled or disabled.

Optionally a marketplace of content providers may be generated and maintained by the system. Users such as potential contributors may provide an indication e.g. via a webpage or dedicated application that they are currently available to provide content that they will be available at one or more specified future time periods how long they will be available their current activity e.g. watching a particular sporting event show or network their planned activity at one or more future time periods etc. Such users may be identified by the system in response to a query from a requester e.g. a publisher or other content requester .

A publisher content requester may view such information and select one or more of the users. The publisher content requester may generate a request for content and instruct the system to transmit the request to the selected users e.g. those watching a particular sporting event show or network associated with the publisher content requester . The offer may specify the type of content requested as similarly discussed elsewhere herein. For example the publisher content requester may create a request offer to ten selected users to be a correspondent for particular game. The offer may include an endorsement arrangement. For example the offer may specify that an accepting user will be paid a specified amount if the submits content of the user talking about a specific product in the context of discussing a particular game event and if the user s content is accepted by the publisher content requester. Upon detecting that a given user s content was accepted e.g. by detecting that the publisher content requester has activated an accept control presented via a webpage or a dedicated application the system may process the payment to the user whose content was accepted on behalf of the publisher content requester. The payment may be in the form of an electronic payment transfer from an account of the publisher content requester to an account of the user or may be in the form of a physical payment instrument e.g. a check a gift card a funded debit card etc. .

At block a query is received from a content requester which may be a content publisher specifying criteria for potential content submitters. For example the criteria may specify some or all of the following the desired profession expertise current availability to provide content of a specified type e.g. text audio and or video future availability at one or more specified future time periods how long they will be available their current activity e.g. watching a particular sporting event show or network their current or future location their planned activity at one or more future time periods the type of desired recording transmission device e.g. mobile phone mobile tablet brand name of device model number of device etc. etc.

At block a search engine may be used to search for and identify potential content contributors that meet the specified criteria or that match a name or other identification information specified by e.g. selected by the requester. A list of matching potential content submitters may be generated and provided to the content requester. At block offer details are received from the content requester. For example the offer details may specify the content that the potential submitter is to submit e.g. how they feel regarding a win by a home team comments regarding a specific show or event etc. . The requester may also specify a time period is which the potential content contributor is to be available a response deadline a response length e.g. in terms of time length or number of words the media type for the response e.g. video including an audio track static images e.g. photographs audio only track text etc. and or other response criteria via a user interface. The requester may also specify compensation. The requester may optionally also specify that it will only accept a specified number of content submissions e.g. the first content submission the first five content submissions three content submissions which may or may not be the first three content submissions etc. .

At block a selection of potential content contributors e.g. selected from the list generated at block is received from the content requester. At block the offer is transmitted to the selected potential content contributors. At block acceptance of the offer may be received from one or more potential content submitters. For example a potential content submitter may activate an accept offer control to indicate acceptance or in some instances submission of the requested content may act as an acceptance of the offer . At block content or a link to content is received from one or more potential content submitters that accepted the offer. For example the content may be recorded and transmitted over a wireless network by a mobile device of the content submitter and received and stored at the system.

At block the content is verified e.g. as similarly discussed above . At block if the content is successfully verified the content is enabled to be published e.g. access to the content is provided to the content requester or an indication that the verification was successful is transmitted to the content requester . If the content is accepted by the content requester at block then at block the system optionally causes the compensation set forth in the offer to be transferred from the content requester to the content provider.

At block the process detects user selections of one or more content contributors included in the search results. The selection may be performed by the user clicking on one or more content contributors included in the search results or otherwise. At block the process detects that the user has activated a control indicating that a set is to be created that includes the selected content contributors where the set may include a single content contributor . The process then generates a corresponding file that defines the set and the process stores the content contributor set file in association with the user s account which may be an account of the company employing the user . It is understood that the stored content contributor set file may but need not include the actual names of the content contributors or pointers or other identifiers associated with the selected content contributors. At block the process receives an identifier from the user for the content contributor and stores the identifier in association with the content contributor set. For example the identifier may be a text name that describes the content contributor set in human understandable language.

An example process for processing a content request will now be described. At block a content request is received from a user e.g. a publisher . For example the content request may include content criteria provided via a content specification interface including content subject matter a content length a content form e.g. video and audio when the content is needed by and or other criteria. At block a user interface is generated that presents a user with a listing of content contributor sets that the user has previously predefined and or that have been defined by another user where appropriate permissions have been granted to the current user e.g. where both users work for the same publisher . For example the content contributor sets listing may be presented at least partly in response to the user logging in to the system and the user selecting an appropriate control. In addition or instead a search interface may be provided enabling a user to search for content contributor sets previously defined by the user or by another user where appropriate permissions have been granted by entering a content contributor sets query. The process will then search for content contributor sets that have identifiers and or metadata matching the query e.g. matching one or more words of the query or a variation of a word in the query .

At block the process detects a user selection of one or more content contributor sets. At block the process transmits the content request to content contributors included in the selected content contributor sets. The content provided in response to the request may then be received from one or more content contributors and processed and or distributed as described elsewhere herein or otherwise. The content may be received indirectly such as from a cloud based storage system. Thus for example the user device may be equipped with an application configured to upload content to the cloud based system via an API. The content distribution facilitation system or the content requester system may then download the content from the cloud based storage system via an API using an application hosted on the content distribution facilitation system or the content requester system. This technique may reduce peak network bandwidth loading and or local storage requirements. The process may automatically or in response to activation of social share control prompt the content requester to transmit a request to the content contributor to post the content or a link to the content on one or more specified social networking sites which may include one or more microblogging sites . The prompt may be provided in response to the content requester downloading or otherwise accessing the content. Optionally the prompt may be provide in response to determining that the content requester has published the content e.g. on the content requester s website television program or other content distribution platform . The determination may be made based on a publication indication provided by the content requester.

At block optionally a verification request is transmitted to verify that the exclusivity specification is correct. For example if the exclusivity specification was received from the publisher the verification request may be transmitted to the content contributor directly or via a representative such as an agent . By way of further example if the exclusivity specification was received from the content contributor the verification request may be transmitted to the publisher directly or via a representative . The verification request may include the content contributor exclusivity specification. At block the process determines whether the content contributor exclusivity specification was verified by the recipient of the content contributor exclusivity specification verification request. For example the request may include a verification control and a decline verification control. The request recipient may then activate one of the controls and the activation is detected and recorded by the process. Optionally if the recipient does not respond or does not respond within a specified period of time the process treats the lack of response as if the recipient declined verification.

Optionally an exclusivity analysis engine may examine the exclusivity specification to determine whether it conflicts with a preexisting in force exclusivity specification of another content requester for the content contributor. For example the process may compare a preexisting in force exclusivity specification from a first content requester with the new exclusivity specification to determine if there is an impermissible overlap in subject areas events and or time period.

If the recipient verified the content contributor exclusivity specification and or the exclusivity analysis engine determined there was no conflict with an existing exclusivity specification at block the process records the content contributor exclusivity specification in association with the content contributor s account profile. If the recipient does not verify or declines to verify the content contributor exclusivity specification and or if there is a conflict with a preexisting content specification at block the process generates a message and transmits it to the exclusivity specification provider indicating the verification failure.

An example search process that analyzes content contributor profiles with respect to exclusivity specifications will now be described. The process may utilize the search engine discussed elsewhere herein. At block a content contributor search query is received. For example as similarly discussed elsewhere herein the content contributor search query may be received via a search query interface from a first user e.g. a publisher . For example the request may include text including desired content contributor characteristics e.g. profession team player position player statistics awards won location gender age profession expertise etc. . In addition a content request may be received. The content request may include content criteria provided via a content specification interface including content subject matter a content length a content form e.g. video and audio when the content is needed by and or other criteria.

At block the process optionally utilizing the search engine described herein searches a database of content contributors to determine which stored content contributor profiles match the search criteria. For example as similarly discussed elsewhere herein the database may include profiles of athletes that may include various statistics events and achievements from some or all of the games they have played in. By way of further example the database may include profiles of personalities or celebrities identifying shows or movies they have appeared in awards or other recognition they have received their ages gender past significant others etc.

At block the process accesses from memory exclusivity provisions e.g. the content contributor exclusivity specification including an identifier of the publisher associated with a given content contributor exclusivity specification for the matching content contributors. At block the process analyzes the exclusivity provisions to identify those matching content contributors that are prohibited from providing requested content to the first user e.g. the publisher . For example the process may determine if a given content contributor exclusivity specification for a given matching content contributor is associated with the first user or with a different user e.g. a different publisher . If a content contributor exclusivity specification for a given content contributor is associated with the first user then the process may determine that the first user may request content from the given content contributor. If a content contributor exclusivity specification for a given content contributor is not associated with the first user e.g. it is instead associated with another publisher then the process may determine that the content contributor exclusivity specification prohibits the content contributor from providing content to the first user.

Optionally if a content contributor exclusivity specification for a given content contributor is not associated with the first user the process further analyzes the content contributor exclusivity specification to determine if the specific exclusivity provisions of the content contributor exclusivity specification prohibit the content contributor from providing the requested content to the first user. For example the process may determine if the content contributor exclusivity specification indicates that the current date or needed by date for the requested content is within an exclusivity date period specified by the content contributor exclusivity specification. By way of further example the process may determine if the content request subject matter is covered by a subject matter exclusivity provision of the content contributor exclusivity specification. By way of yet further example the process may determine if an event corresponding to the content request is covered by an event exclusivity provision of the content contributor exclusivity specification. If the analysis indicates that the content request would violate one or more exclusivity provisions then the process may determine that the content contributor exclusivity specification prohibits the content contributor from providing content to the first user.

The process generates content contributor search results filtering out those content contributors that are exclusive to other users e.g. other publishers . At block the filtered list is provided for display to the first user. The process returns the filtered matching content contributors in search results presented to the first user. Optionally the search results will be in ranked order with the closet match rated first the second closet match rated second etc.

If the user activates the start recording process control illustrated in the example help user interface illustrated in may be presented to the user. In this example the help user interface instructs the user to speak clearly and loudly make sure the user has good lighting for the video recording and to hold the phone steady at eye level.

The orientation of the portable device and or the portable device camera may be detected e.g. by the dedicated application or by a remote system . If the orientation is improper a user interface such as the example illustrated in may be presented instructing the user to rotate the mobile device so it is oriented in a desired orientation and the user interface may instruct the user as to the vertical positioning of the mobile device e.g. eye level .

Once the mobile device is correctly oriented the example user interface illustrated in may be presented. The user interface may include a video record control text that prompts the user to activate the video record control wait for a countdown interface e.g. counting down 3 2 1 then state the user s name and profession and activate the record control again to stop the video recording. The recording of the user may be displayed in an area of the user interface as the recording is being performed. The recording may be performed using a front facing camera of the user mobile device.

The example user interface illustrated in may be presented in response to the user activating the video record control a second time to stop the video recording . The example user interface illustrated in includes a preview control a redo control and a submit control. In response to detecting that the user has activated the preview control the video recording of the user may be played back to the user on the mobile device. If the user is unhappy with the recording the user may activate the redo control and the example user interfaces illustrated in or G may be presented again so that the user can re record the video. If the user is ready to submit the video recording for verification the user can activate the submit control.

For example a video recording of the user made utilizing the foregoing user interfaces may be transmitted to the remote system. The remote system may enable an operator to playback and manually inspect the video recording to verify that the person in the video is the person that corresponds to the name and or other profile information provided by the user. Optionally face recognition technology embodiment in a facial recognition engine may be used in addition or instead to compare the person in the video with a known image of the person that the user is claiming to be. For example a face recognition system may compare facial features e.g. shape size and or relative position of eyes ears nose jaw cheekbone skin color skin texture etc. and or other features of the person in the video recording with the facial features of the person that the user is claiming to be from a known still image or video image of that person. Example algorithms that may be used include PCA Principal Component Analysis Independent Component Analysis ICA EBGM Elastic Bunch Graph Matching LDA Linear Discriminate Analysis Trace transform 3 D morphable face model HMM Hidden Markov model MSL Multilinear Subspace Learning etc. Optionally in addition or instead of using facial recognition voice authentication may be performed using a voice recording which may be a voice track included in the video recording . For example the system may include a voice biometrics analysis engine to determine if the user s voice matches that of a known voice recording of the person the user claims to be. The voice engine may use one or more of the following algorithms and or other algorithms Hidden Markov models neural networks Gaussian mixture models frequency estimation pattern matching algorithms matrix representation vector quantization etc.

If the user is not validated to be the person the user claims to be optionally the system will not create an operable account to the user and may optionally inform the user of the validation failure and of the account denial.

Referring again to an example dashboard is provided towards the bottom of the user interface although it could be positioned elsewhere indicating how many content requests are still pending for the user the user activity e.g. the number of submissions by the user and device settings user preferences terms of service an administrative information. If the user activates a next control which may be in the form of an arrow or other graphic and or in the form of text the example user interface illustrated in may be presented. The example user interface illustrated in repeats the request question includes the countdown timer and the indication as to how many other users have already responded to the same question which may have been updated . The example user interface indicates that the user will be asked to state the user s name at the beginning of the recording and then answer the question. Once the user is ready to answer the question the user can activate the answer control which will cause the example user interface illustrated in to be presented. Optionally additional instructional user interfaces similar to those illustrated in may be first presented.

The example user interface illustrated in repeats the prompt to state the user s name the content subject matter question and the deadline for submitting the content. The user interface includes a video record control text that prompts the user to activate the video record control wait for a countdown interface to reach a certain number e.g. 1 or 0 to begin stating the user s name and answer and to activate the record control again to stop the video recording. Once the user activates the record control presented via the user interface the user s mobile device will begin recording the user s statement of name and answer to the question e.g. using a front facing camera of the mobile device . The recording of the user made using the front facing camera may be displayed in an area of the user interface as the recording is being performed so that the user may view the recording in real time.

The example user interface illustrated in may be presented in response to the user activating the video record control a second time to stop the video recording . The example user interface illustrated in includes a preview control a redo control and a submit control. In response to detecting that the user has activated the preview control the video recording of the user may be played back to the user on the mobile device via a playback user interface and associated content player. The playback user interface may be used to playback content such as video content including an audio track and may include some or all of the following a play control a pause control a rewind control a fast rewind control a fast forward control a scrubber bar and a volume control. If the user is unhappy with the recording the user may activate the redo control and the example user interface illustrated in may be presented again so that the user can re record the video. If the user is ready to submit the video recording the user can activate the submit control.

Referring again to each content contributor listing entry may include a select control. When the user wants to submit a content request to one or more members of the displayed set the user may activate the corresponding select control of the members to whom the content request is to be transmitted. A select all control may be provided to enable the user to select all members of the set with a single activation. A select none control may be provided to enable the user to unselect all members of the set with a single activation. A create request control is provided which when activated will cause a content request user interface to be presented via which the user can specify the content request that is to be sent to the selected members. Examples of the content request user interface are described elsewhere herein. The example content provider set user interface includes a content contributor search field configured to receive a text query. A fields drop down menu may be provided enabling the user to limit the search to matches in particular metadata e.g. name occupation educational institution prior or current employer etc. . A search engine will then search for corresponding matching content providers and provide the search results for display as discussed elsewhere herein in greater detail.

A send control is provided which when activated will cause the content request to be transmitted to the content contributors selected by the user.

Thus certain embodiments enable requests for content to selectively be submitted to a specific target group of potential responders such as athletes actors opinion leaders industry experts celebrities a social or working group or the like and or individually selected or specified content contributors and further enable information and content received from responders to be distributed over one or more distribution channels.
