Additional features of the disclosure may become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings examples and appended claims.

While the disclosed apparatus and methods and are susceptible of embodiments in various forms specific embodiments of the disclosure are illustrated and will hereafter be described with the understanding that the disclosure is intended to be illustrative and is not intended to limit the claims to the specific embodiments described and illustrated herein.

The disclosure generally relates to an adjustable bed in particular incorporating a friction mattress mount. In various embodiments an adjustable bed foundation and optionally a mattress of an adjustable bed each can include friction enhancing materials such that they provide an increased frictional resistance to longitudinal and lateral slipping of the mattress. The friction enhancing materials which are suitably located in a foot region and optionally in a leg region of the adjustable bed maintain the mattress in a desired position and alignment with respect to the adjustable bed foundation in particular when adjustable bed foundation is adjusted between various articulated positions e.g. flat inclined and or declined . The friction enhancing materials provide a non invasive mounting means that can be incorporated onto an outer surface of adjustable bed foundation e.g. a deck support surface thereof and optionally onto an outer surface of essentially any mattress e.g. conventional mattress foam based mattress such as including foam cylinders and they can be used as an alternative to mechanical mattress mounting stabilizing structures e.g. frame mattress mounting brackets and the like which can be also included in or completely absent from the adjustable bed .

The mattress support includes a deck support platform for example including a plurality of deck support sections A D as illustrated. A deck support platform formed from a plurality of deck support sections A D each having a corresponding upper surface A D i.e. the surface which supports the mattress is suitable for the adjustable foundation . In the illustrated embodiment section A corresponds to the foot portion of the bed section B corresponds to the leg portion of the bed section C corresponds to the bottom portion of the bed and section D corresponds to the head and neck portion of the bed i.e. where the sections correspond to the body portion of a user laying on the bed mattress in a normal use orientation . Each section A D includes longitudinally opposed ends Aand A Band B and Dand D respectively where the longitudinal direction Y is generally defined as being perpendicular to the pivot axis P described below and or along the mattress support length or mattress length. Each deck support section A D can be pivotally attached to one or more adjacent sections e.g. directly or indirectly via underlying frame structure as described below thus allowing each section A D to rotate independently around the lateral pivot axis P e.g. an axis generally in the lateral direction X and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction Y . The mattress support generally includes at least two deck support sections for example including a first foot support section A a second leg support section B pivotally attached to the first section A a third bottom support section C pivotally attached to the second section B and a fourth head neck support section D pivotally attached to the third section C as shown in . In other embodiments not shown the mattress support can have fewer or more support sections e.g. a first foot support section a second leg and bottom support section pivotally attached thereto and a third head neck support section pivotally attached thereto . In some embodiments the support sections A D can be formed from a rigid support material such as wood or metal. In other embodiments the support sections A D can be formed from a flexible fabric or padding material e.g. alone or in combination with a rigid support material such as a cover or padding for an underlying rigid support material .

The adjustable frame generally provides the mechanical electrical and electronic support and articulation components for the adjustable foundation and bed . As illustrated the adjustable frame includes a frame support for example including a plurality of frame support sections A D as illustrated and corresponding to the deck support sections A D. Each deck support section A D can be fixedly or removably mounted e.g. via bolts screws or other fastener or adhesive components to its underlying frame support section A D such that when one or more frame support sections A D are articulated the deck support sections A D are correspondingly articulated. As illustrated each frame support section A D can be pivotally attached at a pivot axis P to one or more adjacent sections e.g. directly as illustrated and providing an indirect pivotal attachment for corresponding deck support sections thus allowing each section A D to rotate independently around the lateral pivot axis P. The adjustable frame generally includes at least two frame support sections for example including a first foot support section A a second leg support section B pivotally attached to the first section A a third bottom support section C pivotally attached to the second section B and a fourth head neck support section D pivotally attached to the third section C as shown in . In other embodiments not shown the adjustable frame can have fewer or more frame support sections e.g. a first foot support section a second leg and bottom support section pivotally attached thereto and a third head neck support section pivotally attached thereto .

As illustrated the adjustable frame further includes a subframe for example a rigid non articulatable frame structure which sits on a floor or within a decorative bed frame common in the furniture industry such as a platform bed e.g. via various leg elements not shown and provides stability for the bed foundation as the adjustable frame is articulated to various different positions. The adjustable frame can further include one or more support members connecting structure between the subframe and the frame support and sections A D thereof. In some embodiments one or more of the frame sections A D can be fixed in position relative to the subframe e.g. bottom section C as illustrated and be unable to rotate or articulate relative to the subframe although other frame sections pivotally attached thereto are able to rotate or articulate. As further illustrated the adjustable frame can include one or more actuators variously mounted to one or more of the subframe a support member and a frame support section A D. In some embodiments the subframe the support members and the frame support sections A D can be formed from metal such as steel. The actuators can be any of those commonly known in the art. The actuators and correspondingly the configuration or position of the adjustable frame mattress support and mattress can be controlled and adjusted by a suitable power supply not shown adjustable bed controller not shown e.g. programmable logic controller or otherwise and remote control to deliver repositioning commands not shown .

The mattress is not particularly limited and it can be a conventional mattress e.g. a spring or coil mattress memory foam mattress air mattress with a base e.g. a continuous fabric material suitable for use on a mattress support structure such as a fixed bed frame or an adjustable bed frame. In the illustrated embodiment the mattress includes a mattress containment frame including a plurality of foam cells or foam springs positioned in the frame to provide the sleeping support surface for the mattress. The mattress containment frame includes a lower bottom base sidewalls and endwalls which generally define the interior frame volume housing the foam cells . The sidewalls and endwalls suitably are formed from a foam material. The base can be a generally continuous fabric material e.g. a non woven fabric material . The mattress is generally positioned above the mattress support surface for example sitting directly atop the deck support sections A D. In other embodiments other structure between the mattress and mattress support surface can be present for example a padding or cushion material e.g. which can be continuous or include openings where corresponding friction enhancing materials are positioned on the mattress and mattress support .

The friction mattress alignment system generally includes a first deck friction enhancing material located on an upper surface of the mattress support which contacts an outer bottom surface of the mattress . In some embodiments the system further includes a first mattress friction enhancing material located on the outer bottom surface of the mattress and positioned in a complementary position to the first deck friction enhancing material e.g. friction enhancing materials having generally overlapping areas although they need not have the exact same surface areas or contact areas . In embodiments without the mattress friction enhancing material the first deck friction enhancing material and the outer bottom surface of the mattress have an increased coefficient of static friction at a contact interface between the first deck friction enhancing material and the outer bottom surface of the mattress relative to a corresponding coefficient of static friction between the upper surface of the mattress support surface and the outer bottom surface of the mattress . In embodiments with the mattress friction enhancing material the first deck friction enhancing material and the first mattress friction enhancing material have an increased coefficient of static friction at a contact interface between the first deck friction enhancing material and the first mattress friction enhancing material relative to a corresponding coefficient of static friction between the upper surface of the mattress support surface and the outer bottom surface of the mattress . In either embodiment the increased coefficient of static friction e.g. at least 0.5 or 1 and or up to 1.5 or 2 limits or prevents slippage or movement in the longitudinal direction Y and or the lateral direction X in particular when the adjustable foundation is articulated between various different positions.

In some embodiments the friction enhancing materials in a complementary paring can be in contact with each other when the mattress sits atop the mattress support . As illustrated in for example the deck friction enhancing material A directly contacts the mattress friction enhancing material A and the deck friction enhancing materials B directly contact the mattress friction enhancing materials B i.e. when the mattress is on the mattress support . As further illustrated the friction enhancing materials A A each can be a single piece of friction enhancing material e.g. centrally located across the width direction while the friction enhancing materials B B each can include two pieces of friction enhancing material e.g. laterally spaced apart and positioned at or near the lateral edge of their respective mounting surface . In some embodiments not shown the two piece or multi piece friction enhancing materials B B can be laterally spaced apart and positioned at or near the lateral edge of the foot support section A and or foot end A of the mattress e.g. and also position at the longitudinal end of the foot support section A and mattress such as in the foot corner regions of the mounting surfaces . In other refinements not shown the head section D and or head end D of the mattress can be free of friction enhancing materials include single piece friction enhancing materials or include two piece or multi piece friction enhancing materials laterally spaced apart and positioned at or near the lateral edge and or longitudinal end of the mounting surfaces.

In some embodiments the deck friction enhancing material laterally extends a substantial portion of the mattress support surface width W and the mattress friction enhancing material when present laterally extends a substantial portion of the mattress width W e.g. which can be the same or substantially the same as W . For example the deck friction enhancing material can laterally extend at least 40 50 60 80 or 90 and or up 50 60 80 90 or 100 of the width W and or the mattress friction enhancing material can laterally extend at least 40 50 60 80 or 90 and or up 50 60 80 90 or 100 of the width W. Lateral extension and width are generally defined as parallel to the pivot axis P or equivalently perpendicular to the major length direction of the mattress and mattress support e.g. in the local lateral direction X and perpendicular to the local longitudinal direction Y . Such lateral extension of the friction enhancing materials creates an additional resistance to off longitudinal axis Y twisting force or torque applied to the mattress e.g. when occupants on the mattress create an asymmetric load thereon during bed articulation thus maintaining the mattress properly laterally aligned on the mattress support surface in addition to preventing longitudinal sliding motion. Lateral extent can refer to the total lateral length of the friction enhancing material whether present as a single continuous piece of friction enhancing material or as multiple spaced apart pieces of friction enhancing material. For example as illustrated in the friction enhancing material A is a single piece with width W so the lateral extent is also W and the friction enhancing material A spans a fraction W Wof the mattress . Similarly the friction enhancing material B includes two pieces with the same width W although they could be different in length so the lateral extent is 2W and the friction enhancing material B spans a fraction 2W Wof the mattress . For instance a single 36 inch 91.4 cm wide friction enhancing strip can be used to span about 62 of a 58 inch 147 cm wide queen size mattress or mattress support and two of the 36 inch 91.4 cm wide friction enhancing strips can be used to span about 96 of a 74.8 inch 190 cm wide king size mattress or mattress support e.g. in a split king configuration with two side by side twin mattresses 37.4 inch or 95 cm each with its own laterally aligned friction enhancing strip . In other embodiments lateral extent can refer to the lateral distance separating the two furthest friction enhancing surfaces.

In various embodiments the friction enhancing materials are suitably positioned in a foot section or foot and leg sections of the mattress e.g. at or near a foot end A as opposed to a head end D or in a foot deck support section or foot and leg deck support sections of the mattress support e.g. in deck support section A . Placement of friction enhancing materials in the foot and or leg regions of the adjustable bed is advantageous because articulation of the foot and or leg sections A B A B of the adjustable foundation tends to create shearing forces e.g. in the local longitudinal direction Y and or local lateral direction X between the mattress and the adjustable foundation but minimal or no normal forces e.g. in the local normal direction Z . The friction enhancing materials resist the shearing forces and maintain the mattress in proper alignment without vertical normal separation or lift off of the mattress from the foundation . In contrast friction enhancing materials placed in other regions of the bed might provide less stabilizing effect for example when bed articulation in the region generates normal or lift off forces in particular with a relatively rigid mattress e.g. a conventional spring or coil mattress . In some embodiments deck support sections of the mattress support corresponding to a head portion of the mattress support surface and the mattress are free from friction enhancing materials disposed thereon e.g. and a corresponding head region of the mattress is also free from friction enhancing materials . For example as illustrated in the deck support section D and the corresponding head end D of the mattress are free from friction enhancing materials e.g. although sections such as the leg section B other than the foot section A can include friction enhancing materials . In other embodiments deck support sections of the mattress support other than the foot and or leg deck section are free from friction enhancing materials disposed thereon e.g. and only a corresponding foot and or leg region of the mattress incudes friction enhancing materials disposed thereon when present . For example the friction enhancing materials B B could be removed from the illustrated embodiment of to include only friction enhancing materials A A in the foot sections of the foundation and optionally the mattress .

In an embodiment as illustrated in the deck friction enhancing materials A B can have a diamond shaped orientation relative to the longitudinal direction Y of the adjustable bed . For example the friction enhancing materials A B can include a plurality of rectangular friction enhancing material segments oriented an angle which exposes two edges of a material segment to the longitudinal direction Y of potential slippage for the mattress e.g. an angle which is neither perpendicular to nor parallel with the longitudinal direction Y . Increasing the exposed linear edge and or surface area of the material segment in contact with the mattress can increase frictional resistance and reduce or eliminate mattress slippage. Although the friction enhancing materials A B are illustrated in as a plurality of friction enhancing material segments other shapes and configurations of the friction enhancing material or segments thereof are possible. For example in other embodiments the materials A B can be in the form of unitary materials that have a diamond shape or otherwise present an increased linear edge of exposed material surface relative to a material with an exposed edge which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction Y e.g. a zig zag shape or other shape presenting linear edges of exposed material surface at non perpendicular and non parallel angles relative to the longitudinal direction Y .

The friction enhancing materials are formed from or otherwise include high friction materials that prevent or resist sliding or shearing motion when the materials are in contact with each other e.g. in embodiments including both materials or when the friction enhancing material is in contact with bottom surface of the mattress e.g. when the material contacts a fabric or other bottom surface of the mattress such as in embodiments without the material . For example the coefficient of static friction at a contact interface between the materials or the materials can be at least 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 or 1.0 and or up to 1.2 1.5 or 2 e.g. or even higher for rough surfaces for example 0.5 to 2 0.7 to 1.5 0.8 to 1.2 or 0.9 to 1.1. Such static friction coefficients can represent relatively high friction polymer polymer interfaces and polymer fabric interfaces e.g. when the friction enhancing materials are formed from polymers and contact each other or a fabric surface of a mattress . In some embodiments high friction interfaces can be formed using foamed materials e.g. open or closed cell foamed materials such as formed from polymeric foams as friction enhancing materials.

When one or both of the friction enhancing materials include a polymeric material e.g. an elastomeric materal the polymer material suitably can be a thermoset polymer or a thermoplastic polymer for example a thermoset elastomer or a thermoplastic elastomer. Generally any thermoset or thermoplastic polymer can be used in particular those having desirably high friction surface properties. Elastomeric thermoset or thermoplastic polymers can be particularly suitable as they have a flexible rubbery nature that can be useful for the flexible bottom surface of a mattress or a friction enhancing material that spans a pivot point of an otherwise rigid mattress deck. Example thermoset elastomers include natural polyisoprene natural rubber or synthetic polyisoprene synthetic rubber polybutadiene chloroprene butyl rubber styrene butadiene nitrile rubber ethylene propylene rubber ethylene propylene diene rubber. Example thermoplastic elastomers include thermoplastic styrenic block copolymers thermoplastic polyolefin blends thermoplastic polyolefin copolymers thermoplastic elastomeric alloys thermoplastic polyurethanes thermoplastic copolyesters thermoplastic polyamides and combinations thereof. An example of a suitable thermoplastic polyolefin copolymer for use as a friction enhancing material includes an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer for example in the form of a foamed material alone or in combination e.g. as a foamed blend with one or more other polymeric materials e.g. polyurethane . More generally open or closed cell polymeric foamed materials can be used as friction enhancing materials e.g. foamed polyurethane . Both opposing friction enhancing materials can include polymeric materials.

The inclusion of the friction mattress alignment system into an adjustable bed as generally described herein in any of its variously disclosed embodiments is particularly useful in maintaining the mattress in proper alignment and properly seated on the foundation when the bed is articulated. For example when articulating the adjustable bed from a first position e.g. flat or non flat configuration to a second position other than a flat configuration e.g. as illustrated in for instance the mattress remains substantially in contact with the mattress support surface in the first position and the second position e.g. in the first position in the second position and while transitioning therebetween . For example at least 70 80 90 95 and or up to 80 90 95 or 100 of the surface area remains contact between mattress and mattress support surface in the first and second positions e.g. allowing for some mattress separation from the support surface at the support surface section joints such where the mattress curves but the support surface can have a sharper transition . The mattress can be characterized by a substantial absence of any lift off of the mattress from the support surface and the corresponding friction enhancing materials remain in substantial contact in the first and second positions e.g. at least 90 or 95 and or up to 95 or 100 contact surface area remains between the friction enhancing materials without lift off or delamination of the friction enhancing surfaces . In addition to remaining in substantial contact with the foundation the mattress suitably also remains substantially aligned on its mattress support surface in the first and second positions e.g. longitudinal axes of the mattress and the support surface are within 1 2 5 or 10 of each other .

At least one of the first position and the second position can reflect a high degree of articulation. In an embodiment at least one deck support section A D is angled at least 10 20 30 or 45 and or up to 20 30 45 or 60 relative to an adjacent mattress support surface section in the first or second position e.g. illustrated as angle in FIG. . For example the angle can represent the degree of articulation between the foot section A and an adjacent section such as the leg section B or bottom section depending on structure of adjustable frame the angle can represent the degree of articulation between the head and or back section D and an adjacent section such as the bottom section C e.g. depending on structure of adjustable frame as well as multiple combinations of adjacent mattress support sections.
