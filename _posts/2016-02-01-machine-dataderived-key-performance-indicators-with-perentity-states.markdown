title: Machine data-derived key performance indicators with per-entity states
abstract: Raw machine data are captured and may be organized as events. Entity definitions representing machine entities that perform a service identify the machine data pertaining to respective entities. KPI search queries each define a KPI. Each KPI search query derives one or more values for the KPI from machine data identified in the entity definitions. The derivation may be performed on a per-entity basis and on the aggregate. The derived values may then be translated into a state value domain using per-entity thresholds, aggregate thresholds, or a combination.

No. 14 611 200 filed Jan. 31 2015 entitled Monitoring Service Level Performance Using a Key Performance Indicator KPI Correlation Search which is a continuation in part of U.S. Nonprovisional application Ser. No. 14 528 858 filed Oct. 30 2014 entitled Monitoring Service Level Performance Using Key Performance Indicators Derived from Machine Data issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9 130 860 on Sep. 9 2015 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62 062 104 filed Oct. 9 2014 entitled Monitoring Service Level Performance Using Key Performance Indicators Derived from Machine Data all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to monitoring services and more particularly to monitoring service level performance using a key performance indicators KPIs .

Modern data centers often comprise thousands of hosts that operate collectively to service requests from even larger numbers of remote clients. During operation components of these data centers can produce significant volumes of machine generated data. The unstructured nature of much of this data has made it challenging to perform indexing and searching operations because of the difficulty of applying semantic meaning to unstructured data. As the number of hosts and clients associated with a data center continues to grow processing large volumes of machine generated data in an intelligent manner and effectively presenting the results of such processing continues to be a priority.

The present disclosure is directed to monitoring performance of a system at a service level using key performance indicators derived from machine data. Implementations of the present disclosure provide users with insight to the performance of monitored services such as services pertaining to an information technology IT environment. For example one or more users may wish to monitor the performance of a web hosting service which provides hosted web content to end users via network.

A service can be provided by one or more entities. An entity that provides a service can be associated with machine data. As described in greater detail below the machine data pertaining to a particular entity may use different formats and or different aliases for the entity.

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for normalizing the different aliases and or formats of machine data pertaining to the same entity. In particular an entity definition can be created for a respective entity. The entity definition can normalize various machine data pertaining to a particular entity thus simplifying the use of heterogeneous machine data for monitoring a service.

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for specifying which entities and thus which heterogeneous machine data to use for monitoring a service. In one implementation a service definition is created for a service that is to be monitored. The service definition specifies one or more entity definitions where each entity definition corresponds to a respective entity providing the service. The service definition provides users with flexibility in associating entities with services. The service definition further provides users with the ability to define relationships between entities and services at the machine data level. Implementations of the present disclosure enable end users to monitor services from a top down perspective and can provide rich visualization to troubleshoot any service related issues. Implementations of the present disclosure enable end users to understand an environment e.g. IT environment and the services in the environment. For example end users can understand and monitor services at a business service level application tier level etc.

Implementations of the present disclosure provide users e.g. business analysts a tool for dynamically associating entities with a service. One or more entities can provide a service and or be associated with a service. Implementations of the present disclosure provide a service monitoring system that captures the relationships between entities and services via entity definitions and or service definitions. IT environments typically undergo changes. For example new equipment may be added configurations may change systems may be upgraded and or undergo maintenance etc. The changes that are made to the entities in an IT environment may affect the monitoring of the services in the environment. Implementations of the present disclosure provide a tool that enable users to configure flexible relationships between entities and services to ensure that changes that are made to the entities in the IT environment are accurately captured in the entity definitions and or service definitions. Implementations of the present disclosure can determine the relationships between the entities and services based on changes that are made to an environment without any user interaction and can update also without user interaction the entity definitions and or service definitions to reflect any adjustments made to the entities in the environment as described below in conjunction with .

Implementations of the present disclosure provide users e.g. business analysts an efficient tool for creating entity definitions in a timely manner. Data that describes an IT environment may exist for example for inventory purposes. For example an inventory system can generate a file that contains information relating to physical machines virtual machines application interfaces processes etc. in an IT environment. Entity definitions for various components of the IT environment may be created. At times hundreds of entity definitions are generated and maintained. Implementations of the present disclosure provide a GUI that utilizes existing data e.g. inventory data for creating entity definitions to reduce the amount of time and resources needed for creating the entity definitions.

Implementations of the present disclosure provide users e.g. business analysts an efficient tool for creating entity definitions in a timely manner. Data that describes an IT environment may be obtained for example by executing a search query. A user may run a search query that produces a search result set including information relating to physical machines virtual machines application interfaces users owners and or processes in an IT environment. The information in the search result set may be useful for creating entity definitions. Implementations of the present disclosure provide a GUI that utilizes existing data e.g. search results sets for creating entity definitions to reduce the amount of time and resources needed for creating the entity definitions.

In one implementation one or more entity definitions are created from user input received via an entity definition creation GUI as described in conjunction with . In another implementation one or more entity definitions are created from data in a file and user input received via a GUI as described in conjunction with . In yet another implementation one or more entity definitions are created from data in a search result set and user input received via a GUI as described in conjunction with .

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for creating informational fields and including the informational fields to corresponding entity definitions. An informational field is an entity definition component for storing user defined metadata for a corresponding entity which includes information about the entity that may not be reliably present in or may be absent altogether from the machine data events. Informational fields are described in more detail below with respect to .

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for monitoring a service at a granular level. For example one or more aspects of a service can be monitored using one or more key performance indicators for the service. A performance indicator or key performance indicator KPI is a type of performance measurement. For example users may wish to monitor the CPU central processing unit usage of a web hosting service the memory usage of the web hosting service and the request response time for the web hosting service. In one implementation a separate KPI can be created for each of these aspects of the service that indicates how the corresponding aspect is performing.

Implementations of the present disclosure give users freedom to decide which aspects to monitor for a service and which heterogeneous machine data to use for a particular KPI. In particular one or more KPIs can be created for a service. Each KPI can be defined by a search query that produces a value derived from the machine data identified in the entity definitions specified in the service definition. Each value can be indicative of how a particular aspect of the service is performing at a point in time or during a period of time. Implementations of the present disclosure enable users to decide what value should be produced by the search query defining the KPI. For example a user may wish that the request response time be monitored as the average response time over a period of time.

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for customizing various states that a KPI can be in. For example a user may define a Normal state a Warning state and a Critical state for a KPI and the value produced by the search query of the KPI can indicate the current state of the KPI. In one implementation one or more thresholds are created for each KPI. Each threshold defines an end of a range of values that represent a particular state of the KPI. A graphical interface can be provided to facilitate user input for creating one or more thresholds for each KPI naming the states for the KPI and associating a visual indicator e.g. color pattern to represent a respective state.

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for monitoring a service at a more abstract level as well. In particular an aggregate KPI can be configured and calculated for a service to represent the overall health of a service. For example a service may have 10 KPIs each monitoring a various aspect of the service. The service may have 7 KPIs in a Normal state 2 KPIs in a Warning state and 1 KPI in a Critical state. The aggregate KPI can be a value representative of the overall performance of the service based on the values for the individual KPIs. Implementations of the present disclosure allow individual KPIs of a service to be weighted in terms of how important a particular KPI is to the service relative to the other KPIs in the service thus giving users control of how to represent the overall performance of a service and control in providing a more accurate representation of the performance of the service. In addition specific actions can be defined that are to be taken when the aggregate KPI indicating the overall health of a service for example exceeds a particular threshold.

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for creating notable events and or alarms via distribution thresholding. In one implementation a correlation search is created and used to generate notable event s and or alarm s . A correlation search can be created to determine the status of a set of KPIs for a service over a defined window of time. A correlation search represents a search query that has a triggering condition and one or more actions that correspond to the trigger condition. Thresholds can be set on the distribution of the state of each individual KPI and if the distribution thresholds are exceeded then an alert alarm can be generated.

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for monitoring one or more services using a key performance indicator KPI correlation search. The performance of a service can be vital to the function of an IT environment. Certain services may be more essential than others. For example one or more other services may be dependent on a particular service. The performance of the more crucial services may need to be monitored more aggressively. One or more states of one or more KPIs for one or more services can be proactively monitored periodically using a KPI correlation search. A defined action e.g. creating an alarm sending a notification displaying information in an interface etc. can be taken on conditions specified by the KPI correlation search. Implementations of the present disclosure provide users e.g. business analysts a graphical user interface GUI for defining a KPI correlation search. Implementations of the present disclosure provide visualizations of current KPI state performance that can be used for specifying search information and information for a trigger determination for a KPI correlation search.

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for providing a GUI that presents notable events pertaining to one or more KPIs of one or more services. Such a notable event can be generated by a correlation search associated with a particular service. A correlation search associated with a service can include a search query a triggering determination or triggering condition and one or more actions to be performed based on the triggering determination a determination as to whether the triggering condition is satisfied . In particular a search query may include search criteria pertaining to one or more KIPs of the service and may produce data using the search criteria. For example a search query may produce KPI data for each occurrence of a KPI reaching a certain threshold over a specified period of time. A triggering condition can be applied to the data produced by the search query to determine whether the produced data satisfies the triggering condition. Using the above example the triggering condition can be applied to the produced KPI data to determine whether the number of occurrences of a KPI reaching a certain threshold over a specified period of time exceeds a value in the triggering condition. If the produced data satisfies the triggering condition a particular action can be performed. Specifically if the data produced by the search query satisfies the triggering condition a notable event can be generated. Additional details with respect to this Incident Review interface are provided below with respect to .

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for providing a service monitoring dashboard that displays one or more KPI widgets. Each KPI widget can provide a numerical or graphical representation of one or more values for a corresponding KPI or service health score aggregate KPI for a service indicating how a service or an aspect of a service is performing at one or more points in time. Users can be provided with the ability to design and draw the service monitoring dashboard and to customize each of the KPI widgets. A dashboard creation graphical interface can be provided to define a service monitoring dashboard based on user input allowing different users to each create a customized service monitoring dashboard. Users can select an image for the service monitoring dashboard e.g. image for the background of a service monitoring dashboard image for an entity and or service for service monitoring dashboard draw a flow chart or a representation of an environment e.g. IT environment specify which KPIs to include in the service monitoring dashboard configure a KPI widget for each specified KPI and add one or more adhoc KPI searches to the service monitoring dashboard. Implementations of the present disclosure provide users with service monitoring information that can be continuously and or periodically updated. Each service monitoring dashboard can provide a service level perspective of how one or more services are performing to help users make operating decisions and or further evaluate the performance of one or more services.

Implementations are described for a visual interface that displays time based graphical visualizations that each corresponds to a different KPI reflecting how a service provided by one or more entities is performing. This visual interface may be referred to as a deep dive. As described herein machine data pertaining to one or more entities that provide a given service can be presented and viewed in a number of ways. The deep dive visual interface allows an in depth look at KPI data that reflects how a service or entity is performing over a certain period of time. By having multiple graphical visualizations each representing a different service or a different aspect of the same service the deep dive visual interface allows a user to visually correlate the respective KPIs over a defined period of time. In one implementation the graphical visualizations are all calibrated to the same time scale so that the values of different KPIs can be compared at any given point in time. In one implementation the graphical visualizations are all calibrated to different time scales. Although each graphical visualization is displayed in the same visual interface one or more of the graphical visualizations may have a different time scale than the other graphical visualizations. The different time scale may be more appropriate for the underlying KPI data associated with the one or more graphical visualizations. In one implementation the graphical visualizations are displayed in parallel lanes which simplifies visual correlation and allows a user to relate the performance of one service or one aspect of the service as represented by the KPI values to the performance of one or more additional services or one or more additional aspects of the same service.

The service can be monitored using one or more KPIs for the service. A KPI is a type of performance measurement. One or more KPIs can be defined for a service. In the illustrated example three KPIs A C are defined for service . KPI A may be a measurement of CPU central processing unit usage for the service . KPI B may be a measurement of memory usage for the service . KPI C may be a measurement of request response time for the service .

In one implementation KPI A C is derived based on machine data pertaining to entities A and B that provide the service that is associated with the KPI A C. In another implementation KPI A C is derived based on machine data pertaining to entities other than and or in addition to entities A and B. In another implementation input e.g. user input may be received that defines a custom query which does not use entity filtering and is treated as a KPI. Machine data pertaining to a specific entity can be machine data produced by that entity or machine data about that entity which is produced by another entity. For example machine data pertaining to entity A can be derived from different sources that may be hosted by entity A and or some other entity or entities.

A source of machine data can include for example a software application a module an operating system a script an application programming interface etc. For example machine data B may be log data that is produced by the operating system of entity A. In another example machine data C may be produced by a script that is executing on entity A. In yet another example machine data A may be about an entity A and produced by a software application A that is hosted by another entity to monitor the performance of the entity A through an application programming interface API .

For example entity A may be a virtual machine and software application A may be executing outside of the virtual machine e.g. on a hypervisor or a host operating system to monitor the performance of the virtual machine via an API. The API can generate network packet data including performance measurements for the virtual machine such as memory utilization CPU usage etc.

Similarly machine data pertaining to entity B may include for example machine data D such as log data produced by the operating system of entity B and machine data E such as network packets including http responses generated by a web server hosted by entity B.

Implementations of the present disclosure provide for an association between an entity e.g. a physical machine and machine data pertaining to that entity e.g. machine data produced by different sources hosted by the entity or machine data about the entity that may be produced by sources hosted by some other entity or entities . The association may be provided via an entity definition that identifies machine data from different sources and links the identified machine data with the actual entity to which the machine data pertains as will be discussed in more detail below in conjunction with and . Entities that are part of a particular service can be further grouped via a service definition that specifies entity definitions of the entities providing the service as will be discussed in more detail below in conjunction with .

In the illustrated example an entity definition for entity A can associate machine data A B and C with entity A an entity definition for entity B can associate machine data D and E with entity B and a service definition for service can group entities A and B together thereby defining a pool of machine data that can be operated on to produce KPIs A B and C for the service . In particular each KPI A B C of the service can be defined by a search query that produces a value A B C derived from the machine data A E. As will be discussed in more detail below according to one implementation the machine data A E is identified in entity definitions of entities A and B and the entity definitions are specified in a service definition of service for which values A C are produced to indicate how the service is performing at a point in time or during a period of time. For example KPI A can be defined by a search query that produces value A indicating how the service is performing with respect to CPU usage. KPI B can be defined by a different search query that produces value B indicating how the service is performing with respect to memory usage. KPI C can be defined by yet another search query that produces value C indicating how the service is performing with respect to request response time.

The values A C for the KPIs can be produced by executing the search query of the respective KPI. In one example the search query defining a KPI A C can be executed upon receiving a request e.g. user request . For example a service monitoring dashboard which is described in greater detail below in conjunction with can display KPI widgets providing a numerical or graphical representation of the value for a respective KPI . A user may request the service monitoring dashboard to be displayed at a point in time and the search queries for the KPIs can be executed in response to the request to produce the value for the respective KPI . The produced values can be displayed in the service monitoring dashboard.

In another example the search query defining a KPI A C can be executed in real time continuous execution until interrupted . For example a user may request the service monitoring dashboard to be displayed and the search queries for the KPIs can be executed in response to the request to produce the value for the respective KPI . The produced values can be displayed in the service monitoring dashboard. The search queries for the KPIs can be continuously executed until interrupted and the values for the search queries can be refreshed in the service monitoring dashboard with each execution. Examples of interruption can include changing graphical interfaces stopping execution of a program etc.

In another example the search query defining a KPI can be executed based on a schedule. For example the search query for a KPI e.g. KPI A can be executed at one or more particular times e.g. 6 00 am 12 00 pm 6 00 pm etc. and or based on a period of time e.g. every 5 minutes . In one example the values e.g. values A produced by a search query for a KPI e.g. KPI A by executing the search query on a schedule are stored in a data store and are used to calculate an aggregate KPI score for a service e.g. service as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . An aggregate KPI score for the service is indicative of an overall performance of the KPIs of the service.

In one implementation the machine data e.g. machine data A E used by a search query defining a KPI e.g. KPI A to produce a value can be based on a time range. The time range can be a user defined time range or a default time range. For example in the service monitoring dashboard example above a user can select via the service monitoring dashboard a time range to use to further specify for example based on time stamps which machine data should be used by a search query defining a KPI. For example the time range can be defined as Last 15 minutes which would represent an aggregation period for producing the value. In other words if the query is executed periodically e.g. every 5 minutes the value resulting from each execution can be based on the last 15 minutes on a rolling basis and the value resulting from each execution can be for example the maximum value during a corresponding 15 minute time range the minimum value during the corresponding 15 minute time range an average value for the corresponding 15 minute time range etc.

In another implementation the time range is a selected e.g. user selected point in time and the definition of an individual KPI can specify the aggregation period for the respective KPI. By including the aggregation period for an individual KPI as part of the definition of the respective KPI multiple KPIs can run on different aggregation periods which can more accurately represent certain types of aggregations such as distinct counts and sums improving the utility of defined thresholds. In this manner the value of each KPI can be displayed at a given point in time. In one example a user may also select real time as the point in time to produce the most up to date value for each KPI using its respective individually defined aggregation period.

An event processing system can process a search query that defines a KPI of a service. An event processing system can aggregate heterogeneous machine generated data machine data received from various sources e.g. servers databases applications networks etc. and optionally provide filtering such that data is only represented where it pertains to the entities providing the service. In one example a KPI may be defined by a user defined custom query that does not use entity filtering. The aggregated machine data can be processed and represented as events. An event can be represented by a data structure that is associated with a certain point in time and comprises a portion of raw machine data i.e. machine data . Events are described in greater detail below in conjunction with . The event processing system can be configured to perform real time indexing of the machine data and to execute real time scheduled or historic searches on the source data. An exemplary event processing system is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The entity module can create entity definitions. Create hereinafter includes edit throughout this document. An entity definition is a data structure that associates an entity e.g. entity A in with machine data e.g. machine data A C in . The entity module can determine associations between machine data and entities and can create an entity definition that associates an individual entity with machine data produced by different sources hosted by that entity and or other entity ies . In one implementation the entity module automatically identifies the entities in an environment e.g. IT environment automatically determines for each entity which machine data is associated with that particular entity and automatically generates an entity definition for each entity. In another implementation the entity module receives input e.g. user input for creating an entity definition for an entity as will be discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Each of the machine data A C can include an alias that references the entity . At least some of the aliases for the particular entity may be different from each other. For example the alias for entity in machine data A may be an identifier ID number the alias for entity in machine data B may be a hostname and the alias for entity in machine data C may be an IP internet protocol address .

The entity module can receive input for an identifying name for the entity and can include the identifying name in the entity definition . The identifying name can be defined from input e.g. user input . For example the entity may be a web server and the entity module may receive input specifying webserver01.splunk.com as the identifying name . The identifying name can be used to normalize the different aliases of the entity from the machine data A C to a single identifier.

A KPI for example for monitoring CPU usage for a service provided by the entity can be defined by a search query directed to search machine data A C based a service definition which is described in greater detail below in conjunction with associating the entity definition with the KPI the entity definition associating the entity with the identifying name and associating the identifying name e.g. webserver01.splunk.com with the various aliases e.g. ID number hostname and IP address .

Referring to the service module can create service definitions for services. A service definition is a data structure that associates one or more entities with a service. The service module can receive input e.g. user input of a title and or description for a service definition. is a block diagram illustrating a service definition that associates one or more entities with a service in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. In another implementation a service definition specifies one or more other services which a service depends upon and does not associate any entities with the service as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . In another implementation a service definition specifies a service as a collection of one or more other services and one or more entities.

In one example a service is provided by one or more entities A N. For example entities A N may be web servers that provide the service e.g. web hosting service . In another example a service may be a database service that provides database data to other services e.g. analytical services . The entities A N which provides the database service may be database servers.

The service module can include an entity definition A N for a corresponding entity A N that provides the service in the service definition for the service . The service module can receive input e.g. user input identifying one or more entity definitions to include in a service definition.

The service module can include dependencies in the service definition . The dependencies indicate one or more other services for which the service is dependent upon. For example another set of entities e.g. host machines may define a testing environment that provides a sandbox service for isolating and testing untested programming code changes. In another example a specific set of entities e.g. host machines may define a revision control system that provides a revision control service to a development organization. In yet another example a set of entities e.g. switches firewall systems and routers may define a network that provides a networking service. The sandbox service can depend on the revision control service and the networking service. The revision control service can depend on the networking service. If the service is the sandbox service and the service definition is for the sandbox service the dependencies can include the revision control service and the networking service. The service module can receive input specifying the other service s for which the service is dependent on and can include the dependencies between the services in the service definition . In one implementation the service associated defined by the service definition may be designated as a dependency for another service and the service definition can include information indicating the other services which depend on the service described by the service definition .

Referring to the KPI module can create one or more KPIs for a service and include the KPIs in the service definition. For example in various aspects e.g. CPU usage memory usage response time etc. of the service can be monitored using respective KPIs. The KPI module can receive input e.g. user input defining a KPI for each aspect of the service to be monitored and include the KPIs e.g. KPIs A N in the service definition for the service . Each KPI can be defined by a search query that can produce a value. For example the KPI A can be defined by a search query that produces value A and the KPI N can be defined by a search query that produces value N.

The KPI module can receive input specifying the search processing language for the search query defining the KPI. The input can include a search string defining the search query and or selection of a data model to define the search query. Data models are described in greater detail below in conjunction with . The search query can produce for a corresponding KPI value A N derived from machine data that is identified in the entity definitions A N that are identified in the service definition .

The KPI module can receive input to define one or more thresholds for one or more KPIs. For example the KPI module can receive input defining one or more thresholds A for KPI A and input defining one or more thresholds N for KPI N. Each threshold defines an end of a range of values representing a certain state for the KPI. Multiple states can be defined for the KPI e.g. unknown state trivial state informational state normal state warning state error state and critical state and the current state of the KPI depends on which range the value which is produced by the search query defining the KPI falls into. The KPI module can include the threshold definition s in the KPI definitions. The service module can include the defined KPIs in the service definition for the service.

The KPI module can calculate an aggregate KPI score for the service for continuous monitoring of the service. The score can be a calculated value for the aggregate of the KPIs for the service to indicate an overall performance of the service. For example if the service has 10 KPIs and if the values produced by the search queries for 9 of the 10 KPIs indicate that the corresponding KPI is in a normal state then the value for an aggregate KPI may indicate that the overall performance of the service is satisfactory. Some implementations of calculating a value for an aggregate KPI for the service are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Referring to the service monitoring system can be coupled to one or more data stores . The entity definitions the service definitions and the KPI definitions can be stored in the data store s that are coupled to the service monitoring system . The entity definitions the service definitions and the KPI definitions can be stored in a data store in a key value store a configuration file a lookup file a database or in metadata fields associated with events representing the machine data. A data store can be a persistent storage that is capable of storing data. A persistent storage can be a local storage unit or a remote storage unit. Persistent storage can be a magnetic storage unit optical storage unit solid state storage unit electronic storage units main memory or similar storage unit. Persistent storage can be a monolithic device or a distributed set of devices. A set as used herein refers to any positive whole number of items.

The user interface UI module can generate graphical interfaces for creating and or editing entity definitions for entities creating and or editing service definitions for services defining key performance indicators KPIs for services setting thresholds for the KPIs and defining aggregate KPI scores for services. The graphical interfaces can be user interfaces and or graphical user interfaces GUIs .

The UI module can cause the display of the graphical interfaces and can receive input via the graphical interfaces. The entity module service module KPI module dashboard module deep dive module and home page module can receive input via the graphical interfaces generated by the UI module . The entity module service module KPI module dashboard module deep dive module and home page module can provide data to be displayed in the graphical interfaces to the UI module and the UI module can cause the display of the data in the graphical interfaces.

The dashboard module can create a service monitoring dashboard. In one implementation dashboard module works in connection with UI module to present a dashboard creation graphical interface that includes a modifiable dashboard template an interface containing drawing tools to customize a service monitoring dashboard to define flow charts text and connections between different elements on the service monitoring dashboard a KPI selection interface and or service selection interface and a configuration interface for creating service monitoring dashboard. The service monitoring dashboard displays one or more KPI widgets. Each KPI widget can provide a numerical or graphical representation of one or more values for a corresponding KPI indicating how an aspect of a service is performing at one or more points in time. Dashboard module can work in connection with UI module to define the service monitoring dashboard in response to user input and to cause display of the service monitoring dashboard including the one or more KPI widgets. The input can be used to customize the service monitoring dashboard. The input can include for example selection of one or more images for the service monitoring dashboard e.g. a background image for the service monitoring dashboard an image to represent an entity and or service creation and representation of adhoc search in the form of KPI widgets selection of one or more KPIs to represent in the service monitoring dashboard selection of a KPI widget for each selected KPI. The input can be stored in the one or more data stores that are coupled to the dashboard module . In other implementations some other software or hardware module may perform the actions associated with generating and displaying the service monitoring dashboard although the general functionality and features of the service monitoring dashboard should remain as described herein. Some implementations of creating the service monitoring dashboard and causing display of the service monitoring dashboard are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

In one implementation deep dive module works in connection with UI module to present a wizard for creation and editing of the deep dive visual interface to generate the deep dive visual interface in response to user input and to cause display of the deep dive visual interface including the one or more graphical visualizations. The input can be stored in the one or more data stores that are coupled to the deep dive module . In other implementations some other software or hardware module may perform the actions associated with generating and displaying the deep dive visual interface although the general functionality and features of deep dive should remain as described herein. Some implementations of creating the deep dive visual interface and causing display of the deep dive visual interface are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The home page module can create a home page graphical interface. The home page graphical interface can include one or more tiles where each tile represents a service related alarm service monitoring dashboard a deep dive visual interface or the value of a particular KPI. In one implementation home page module works in connection with UI module . The UI module can cause the display of the home page graphical interface. The home page module can receive input e.g. user input to request a service monitoring dashboard or a deep dive to be displayed. The input can include for example selection of a tile representing a service monitoring dashboard or a deep dive. In other implementations some other software or hardware module may perform the actions associated with generating and displaying the home page graphical interface although the general functionality and features of the home page graphical interface should remain as described herein. An example home page graphical interface is discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Referring to the service monitoring system can be coupled to an event processing system via one or more networks. The event processing system can receive a request from the service monitoring system to process a search query. For example the dashboard module may receive input request to display a service monitoring dashboard with one or more KPI widgets. The dashboard module can request the event processing system to process a search query for each KPI represented by a KPI widget in the service monitoring dashboard. Some implementations of an event processing system are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The one or more networks can include one or more public networks e.g. the Internet one or more private networks e.g. a local area network LAN or one or more wide area networks WAN one or more wired networks e.g. Ethernet network one or more wireless networks e.g. an 802.11 network or a Wi Fi network one or more cellular networks e.g. a Long Term Evolution LTE network routers hubs switches server computers and or a combination thereof.

At block the computing machine creates one or more entity definitions each for a corresponding entity. Each entity definition associates an entity with machine data that pertains to that entity. As described above various machine data may be associated with a particular entity but may use different aliases for identifying the same entity. The entity definition for an entity normalizes the different aliases of that entity. In one implementation the computing machine receives input for creating the entity definition. The input can be user input. Some implementations of creating an entity definition for an entity from input received via a graphical user interface are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

In another implementation the computing machine imports a data file e.g. CSV comma separated values data file that includes information identifying entities in an environment and uses the data file to automatically create entity definitions for the entities described in the data file. The data file may be stored in a data store e.g. data store in that is coupled to the computing machine.

In another implementation the computing machine automatically without any user input identifies one or more aliases for an entity in machine data and automatically creates an entity definition in response to automatically identifying the aliases of the entity in the machine data. For example the computing machine can execute a search query from a saved search to extract data to identify an alias for an entity in machine data from one or more sources and automatically create an entity definition for the entity based on the identified aliases. Some implementations of creating an entity definition from importing a data file and or from a saved search are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine creates a service definition for a service using the entity definitions of the one or more entities that provide the service according to one implementation. A service definition can relate one or more entities to a service. For example the service definition can include an entity definition for each of the entities that provide the service. In one implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input for creating the service definition. Some implementations of creating a service definition from input received via a graphical interface are discussed in more detail below in conjunction with . In one implementation the computing machine automatically creates a service definition for a service. In another example a service may not directly be provided by one or more entities and the service definition for the service may not directly relate one or more entities to the service. For example a service definition for a service may not contain any entity definitions and may contain information indicating that the service is dependent on one or more other services. A service that is dependent on one or more other services is described in greater detail below in conjunction with . For example a business service may not be directly provided by one or more entities and may be dependent on one or more other services. For example an online store service may depend on an e commerce service provided by an e commerce system a database service and a network service. The online store service can be monitored via the entities of the other services e.g. e commerce service database service and network service upon which the service depends on.

At block the computing machine creates one or more key performance indicators KPIs corresponding to one or more aspects of the service. An aspect of a service may refer to a certain characteristic of the service that can be measured at various points in time during the operation of the service. For example aspects of a web hosting service may include request response time CPU usage and memory usage. Each KPI for the service can be defined by a search query that produces a value derived from the machine data that is identified in the entity definitions included in the service definition for the service. Each value is indicative of how an aspect of the service is performing at a point in time or during a period of time. In one implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input for creating the KPI s for the service. Some implementations of creating KPI s for a service from input received via a graphical interface will be discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . In one implementation the computing machine automatically creates one or more key performance indicators KPIs corresponding to one or more aspects of the service.

At block the computing machine receives input of an identifying name for referencing the entity definition for an entity. The input can be user input. The user input can be received via a graphical interface. Some implementations of creating an entity definition via input received from a graphical interface are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . The identifying name can be a unique name.

At block the computing machine receives input e.g. user input specifying one or more search fields fields representing the entity in machine data from different sources to be used to normalize different aliases of the entity. Machine data can be represented as events. As described above the computing machine can be coupled to an event processing system e.g. event processing system in . The event processing system can process machine data to represent the machine data as events. Each of the events is raw data and when a late binding schema is applied to the events values for fields defined by the schema are extracted from the events. A number of default fields that specify metadata about the events rather than data in the events themselves can be created automatically. For example such default fields can specify a timestamp for the event data a host from which the event data originated a source of the event data and a source type for the event data. These default fields may be determined automatically when the events are created indexed or stored. Each event has metadata associated with the respective event. Implementations of the event processing system processing the machine data to be represented as events are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine receives input e.g. user input specifying one or more search values values for the fields to establish associations between the entity and machine data. The values can be used to search for the events that have matching values for the above fields. The entity can be associated with the machine data that is represented by the events that have fields that store values that match the received input.

The computing machine can optionally also receive input e.g. user input specifying a type of entity to which the entity definition applies. The computing machine can optionally also receive input e.g. user input associating the entity of the entity definition with one or more services. Some implementations of receiving input for an entity type for an entity definition and associating the entity with one or more services are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Upon the selection of the Configure menu item a drop down menu listing configuration options can be displayed. If the user selects the entities option from the drop down menu a GUI for creating an entity definition can be displayed as discussed in more detail below in conjunction with . If the user selects the services option from the drop down menu a GUI for creating a service definition can be displayed as discussed in more detail below in conjunction with .

For example the identifying name is webserver01.splunk.com and the entity type is web server. Examples of entity type can include and are not limited to host machine virtual machine type of server e.g. web server email server database server etc. switch firewall router sensor etc. The fields that are part of the entity definition can be used to normalize the various aliases for the entity. For example the entity definition specifies three fields and four values e.g. values to associate the entity with the events that include any of the four values in any of the three fields.

For example the event processing system e.g. event processing system in can apply a late binding schema to the events to extract values for fields e.g. host field ip field and dest field defined by the schema and determine which events have values that are extracted for a host field that includes 10.11.12.13 webserver01.splunk.com webserver01 or vm 0123 determine which events have values that are extracted for an ip field that includes 10.11.12.13 webserver01.splunk.com webserver01 or vm 0123 or a dest field that includes 10.11.12.13 webserver01.splunk.com webserver01 or vm 0123. The machine data that relates to the events that are produced from the search is the machine data that is associated with the entity webserver01.splunk.com.

In another implementation the entity definition can specify one or more values to use for a specific field . For example the value 10.11.12.13 may be used for extracting values for the ip field and determine which values match the value and the value webserver01.splunk.com and the value vm 0123 may be used for extracting values for the host field and determining which values match the value or value .

In another implementation GUI includes a list of identifying field value pairs. A search term that is modeled after these entities can constructed such that when a late binding schema is applied to events values that match the identifiers associated with the fields defined by the schema will be extracted. For example if identifier.fields X Y then the entity definition should include input specifying fields labeled X and Y . The entity definition should also include input mapping the fields. For example the entity definition can include the mapping of the fields as X 1 Y 2 3 . The event processing system e.g. event processing system in can apply a late binding schema to the events to extract values for fields e.g. X and Y defined by the schema and determine which events have values extracted for an X field that include 1 or which events have values extracted for a Y field that include 2 or which events have values extracted for a Y field that include 3 .

GUI can facilitate user input specifying any services that the entity provides. The input can specify one or more services that have corresponding service definitions. For example if there is a service definition for a service named web hosting service that is provided by the entity corresponding to the entity definition then a user can specify the web hosting service as a service in the entity definition.

The save button can be selected to save the entity definition in a data store e.g. data store in . The saved entity definition can be edited.

GUI can include text boxes A B that enables a user to specify a name value pair for informational fields. Informational fields are described in greater detail below in conjunction with . GUI can include a button which when selected display additional text boxes A B for specifying a name value pair for an informational field.

GUI can include a text box that enables a user to associate the entity being represented by the entity definition with one or more services. In one implementation user input of one or more strings that identify the one or more service is received via text box . In one implementation when text box is selected e.g. clicked a list of service definition is displayed which a user can select from. The list can be populated using service definitions that are stored in a service monitoring data store as described in greater detail below.

The entity definition structure includes one or more components. Each entity definition component relates to a characteristic of the entity. For example there is an entity name component one or more alias components one or more informational info field components one or more service association components and one or more components for other information . The characteristic of the entity being represented by a particular component is the particular entity definition component s type. For example if a particular component represents an alias characteristic of the entity the component is an alias type component.

Each entity definition component stores information for an element. The information can include an element name and one or more element values for the element. In one implementation the element name value pair s within an entity definition component serves as a field name field value pair for a search query. The search query can be directed to search machine data. As described above the computing machine can be coupled to an event processing system e.g. event processing system in . Machine data can be represented as events. Each of the events includes raw data. The event processing system can apply a late binding schema to the events to extract values for fields defined by the schema and determine which events have values that are extracted for a field. A component in the entity definition includes a an element name that can be in one implementation a name of a field defined by the schema and b one or more element values that can be in one implementation one or more extracted values for the field identified by the element name.

The element names for the entity definition components e.g. name component the alias components A B and the informational info field components A B can be based on user input. In one implementation the elements names correspond to data items that are imported from a file as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . In another implementation the element names correspond to data items that are imported from a search result set as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . In one implementation element names for any additional service information that can be associated with the entities are received via user input.

The elements values for the entity definition components e.g. name component the alias components A B and the informational field components A B can be based on user input. In one implementation the values correspond to data items that are imported from a file as described in greater detail below in conjunction with and . In another implementation the values correspond to data items that are imported from a search result set as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

In one implementation an entity definition includes one entity component for each entity characteristic represented in the definition. Each entity component may have as many elements as required to adequately express the associated characteristic of the entity. Each element may be represented as a name value pair i.e. element name element value where the value of that name value pair may be scalar or compound. Each component is a logical data collection.

In another implementation an entity definition includes one or more entity components for each entity characteristic represented in the definition. Each entity component has a single element that may be represented as a name value pair i.e. element name element value . The value of that name value pair may be scalar or compound. The number of entity components of a particular type within the entity definition may be determined by the number needed to adequately express the associated characteristic of the entity. Each component is a logical data collection.

In another implementation an entity definition includes one or more entity components for each entity characteristic represented in the definition. Each entity component may have one or more elements that may each be represented as a name value pair i.e. element name element value . The value of that name value pair may be scalar or compound. The number of elements for a particular entity component may be determined by some meaningful grouping factor such as the day and time of entry into the entity definition. The number of entity components of a particular type within the entity definition may be determined by the number needed to adequately express the associated characteristic of the entity. Each component is a logical data collection. These and other implementations are possible including representations in RDBMS s and the like.

There can be one or multiple components having a particular entity definition component type. For example the entity definition record has two components e.g. informational field component A and informational field component B having the informational field component type. In another example the entity definition record has two components e.g. alias component A and alias component B having the alias component type. In one implementation some combination of a single and multiple components of the same type are used to store information pertaining to a characteristic of an entity.

An entity definition component can store a single value for an element or multiple values for the element. For example alias component A stores an element name of IP and a single element value of 1.1.1.1 . Alias component B stores an element name of IP2 and multiple element values of 2.2.2.2 and 5.5.5.5 . In one implementation when an entity definition component stores multiple values for the same element and when the element name element value pair is used for a search query the search query uses the values disjunctively. For example a search query may search for fields named IP2 and having either a 2.2.2.2 value or a 5.5.5.5 value.

As described above the element name element value pair in an entity definition record can be used as a field value pair for a search query. Various machine data may be associated with a particular entity but may use different aliases for identifying the same entity. Record has an alias component A that stores information for one alias and has another alias component B that stores another alias element having two alias element values for the entity. The alias components A B of the entity definition can be used to aggregate event data associated with different aliases for the entity represented by the entity definition. The element name element value pairs for the alias components can be used as field value pairs to search for the events that have matching values for fields specified by the elements names. The entity can be associated with the machine data represented by the events having associated fields whose values match the element values in the alias components. For example a search query may search for events with a 1.1.1.1 value in a field named IP and events with either a 2.2.2.2 value or a 5.5.5.5 value in a field named IP2 .

Various implementations may use a variety of data representation and or organization for the component information in an entity definition record based on such factors as performance data density site conventions and available application infrastructure for example. The structure e.g. structure in of an entity definition can include rows entries or tuples to depict components of an entity definition. An entity definition component can be a normalized tabular representation for the component as can be used in an implementation such as an implementation storing the entity definition within an RDBMS. Different implementations may use different representations for component information for example representations that are not normalized and or not tabular. Different implementations may use various data storage and retrieval frameworks a JSON based database as one example to facilitate storing entity definitions entity definition records . Further within an implementation some information may be implied by for example the position within a defined data structure or schema where a value such as 1.1.1.1 in is stored rather than being stored explicitly. For example in an implementation having a defined data structure for an entity definition where the first data item is defined to be the value of the name element for the name component of the entity only the value need be explicitly stored as the entity component and the element name name are known from the data structure definition.

At block the computing machine receives a file having multiple entries. The computing machine may receive the entire file or something less. The file can be stored in a data store. User input can be received via a graphical user interface GUI requesting access to the file. One implementation of receiving the file via a GUI is described in greater detail below in conjunction with . The file can be a file that is generated by a tool e.g. inventory system and includes information pertaining to an IT environment. For example the file may include a list of entities e.g. physical machines virtual machines APIs processes etc. in an IT environment and various characteristics e.g. name aliases user role operating system etc. for each entity. One or more entries in the file can correspond to a particular entity. Each entry can include one or more data items. Each data item can correspond to a characteristic of the particular entity. The file can be a delimited file where multiple entries in the file are separated using entry delimiters and the data items within a particular entry in the file are separated using data item delimiters.

A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters printable or not used to specify a boundary between separate independent regions in plain text or other data streams. An entry delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters to separate entries in the file. An example of an entry delimiter is an end of line indicator. An end of line indicator can be a special character or a sequence of characters. Examples of an end of line indicator include and are not limited to a line feed LF and a carriage return CR . A data item delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters to separate data items in an entry. Examples of a data item delimiter can include and are not limited to a comma character a space character a semicolon quote s brace s pipe slash es and a tab.

An example of a delimited file includes and is not limited to a comma separated values CSV file. Such a CSV file can have entries for different entities separated by line feeds or carriage returns and an entry for each entity can include data items e.g. entity name entity alias entity user entity operating system etc. in proper sequence separated by comma characters. Null data items can be represented by having nothing between sequential delimiters i.e. one comma immediately followed by another. An example of a CSV file is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Each entry in the delimited file has an ordinal position within the file and each data item has an ordinal position within the corresponding entry in the file. An ordinal position is a specified position in a numbered series. Each entry in the file can have the same number of data items. Alternatively the number of data items per entry can vary.

At block the computing machine creates a table having one or more rows and one or more columns in each row. The number of rows in the table can be based on the number of entries in the file and the number of columns in the table can be based on the number of data items in an entry of the file e.g. the number of data items in an entry having the most data items . Each row has an ordinal position within the table and each column has an ordinal position within the table. At block the computing machine associates the entries in the file with corresponding rows in the table based on the ordinal positions of the entries within the file and the ordinal positions of the rows within the table. For each entry the computing machine matches the ordinal position of the entry with the ordinal position of one of the rows. The matched ordinal positions need not be equal in an implementation and one may be calculated from the other using for example an offset value.

At block for each entry in the file the computing machine imports each of the data items of the particular entry in the file into a respective column of the same row of the table. An example of importing the data items of a particular entry to populate a respective column of a same row of a table is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing system causes display in a GUI of one or more rows of the table populated with data items imported from the file. An example GUI presenting a table with data items imported from a delimited file is described in greater detail below in conjunction with and .

At block the computing machine receives user input designating for each of one or more respective columns an element name and a type of entity definition component to which the respective column pertains. As discussed above an entity definition component type represents a particular characteristic type e.g. name alias information service association etc. of an entity. An element name represents a name of an element associated with a corresponding characteristic of an entity. For example the entity definition component type may be an alias component type and an element associated with an alias of an entity may be an element name IP .

The user input designating for each respective column an element name and a type e.g. name alias informational field service association and other of entity definition component to which the respective column pertains can be received via the GUI. One implementation of user input designating for each respective column an element name and a type of entity definition component to which the respective column pertains is discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine stores for each of one or more of the data items of the particular entry of the file a value of an element of an entity definition. A data item will be stored if it appeared in a column for which a proper element name and entity definition component type were specified. An entity definition includes one or more components. Each component stores information pertaining to an element. The element of the entity definition has the element name designated for the respective column in which the data item appeared. The element of the entity definition is associated with an entity definition component having the type designated for the respective column in which the data item appeared. The element names and the values for the elements can be stored in an entity definition data store which may be a relational database e.g. SQL server or a document oriented database e.g. MongoDB for example.

The rows in the file can be defined by the delimiters that separate the entries A C. The entry delimiters can include for example line breaks such as a line feed not shown or carriage return not shown . In one implementation one type of entry delimiter is used to separate the entries in the same file.

The nominal columns in the file can be defined by delimiters that separate the data items in the entries A C. The data item delimiter may be for example a comma character. For example for entry A IP and IP2 are separated by a comma character IP2 and user are also separated by a comma character and user and name are also separated by a comma character. In one implementation the same type of delimiter is used to separate the data items in the same file.

The first entry A in the file may be a header entry. The data items e.g. IP IP2 user name in the header entry A can be names defining the types of data items in the file .

A table can be displayed in a GUI. The table can include one or more rows. In one implementation a top row in the table is a column identifier row and each subsequent row A B is a data row. A column identifier row contains column identifiers such as an element name A D and an entity definition component type A D for each column A D in the table . User input can be received via the GUI for designating the element names A D and component types A D for each column A D.

In one implementation the data items of the first entry e.g. entry A in the file are automatically imported as the element names A D into the column identifier row in the table and user input is received via the GUI that indicates acceptance of using the data items of the first entry A in the file as the element names A D in the table . In one implementation user input designating the component types is also received via the GUI. For example a user selection of a save button or a next button in a GUI can indicate acceptance. One implementation of a GUI facilitating user input for designating the element names and component types for each column is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The determination of how to import a data item from the file to a particular location in the table is based on ordinal positions of the data items within a respective entry in the file and ordinal positions of columns within the table . In one implementation ordinal positions of the entries A D within the file and ordinal positions of the rows e.g. rows A B within the table are used to determine how to import a data item from the file into the table .

Each of the entries and data items in the file has an ordinal position. Each of the rows and columns in the table has an ordinal position. In one implementation the first position in a numbered series is zero. In another implementation the first position in a numbered series is one.

For example each entry A C in the file has an ordinal position within the file . In one implementation the top entry in the file has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent entry has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the entry having the first position. For example for file entry A has an ordinal position of one entry B has an ordinal position of two and entry C has an ordinal position of three.

Each data item in an entry A C has an ordinal position within the respective entry. In one implementation the left most data item in an entry has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent data item has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the data item having the first position. For example for entry A IP has an ordinal position of one IP2 has an ordinal position of two user has an ordinal position of three and name has an ordinal position of four.

Each row in the table has an ordinal position within the table . In one implementation the top row in the table has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent row has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the row having the first position. For example for table row has an ordinal position of one row A has an ordinal position of two and row B has an ordinal position of three.

Each column in the table has an ordinal position within the table . In one implementation the left most column in the table has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent column has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the column having the first position. For example for table column A has an ordinal position of one column B has an ordinal position of two column C has an ordinal position of three and column D has an ordinal position of four.

Each element name A C in the table has an ordinal position within the table . In one implementation the left most element name in the table has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent element name has a corresponding position in the numbered series relative to the element name having the first position. For example for table element name A has an ordinal position of one element name B has an ordinal position of two element name C has an ordinal position of three and element name D has an ordinal position of four.

The ordinal positions of the rows in the table and the ordinal positions of the entries A C in the file A can correspond to each other. The ordinal positions of the columns in the table and the ordinal positions of the data items in the file can correspond to each other. The ordinal positions of the element names in the table and the ordinal positions of the data items in the file can correspond to each other.

The determination of an entity name A D in which to place a data item can be based on the ordinal position of the entity name A D that corresponds to the ordinal position of the data item. For example IP has an ordinal position of one within entry A in the file . Element name A has an ordinal position that matches the ordinal position of IP . IP can be imported from the file and placed in row and in element name A.

The data items for a particular entry in the file can appear in the same row in the table . The determination of a row in which to place the data items for the particular entry can be based on the ordinal position of the row that corresponds to the ordinal position of the entry. For example entry B has an ordinal position of two. Row A has an ordinal position that matches the ordinal position of entry B. 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2 jsmith and foobar can be imported from the file and placed in row A in the table .

The determination of a column in which to place a particular data item can be based on the ordinal position of the column within the table that corresponds to the ordinal position of the data items within a particular entry in the file . For example 1.1.1.1 in entry B has an ordinal position of one. Column A has an ordinal position that matches the ordinal position of 1.1.1.1 . 1.1.1.1 can be imported from the file and placed in row A and in column A.

Corresponding ordinal positions need not be equal in an implementation and one may be calculated from the other using for example an offset value.

User input designating the component types A D in the table is received via the GUI. For example a selection of Alias is received for component type A a selection of Alias is received for component type B a selection of Informational Field is received for component type C and a selection of Name is received for component type D. One implementation of a GUI facilitating user input for designating the component types for each column is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

User input can be received via the GUI for creating entity definitions records A B using the element names A D component types A D and data items displayed in the table and importing the entity definitions records A B in a data store as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

When user input designating the entity definition component types A D for the table is received and user input indicating acceptance of the display of the data items from file into the table is received the entity definition records can be created and stored. For example two entity definition records A B are created.

As described above in one implementation an entity definition stores no more than one component having a name component type. The entity definition can store zero or more components having an alias component type and can store zero or more components having an informational field component type. In one implementation user input is received via a GUI e.g. entity definition editing GUI service definition GUI to add one or more service association components and or one or more other information components to an entity definition record. While not explicitly shown in the illustrative example of the teachings regarding the importation of component information into entity definition records from file data can understandably be applied to service association component information after the fashion illustrated for alias and informational field component information for example.

In one implementation the entity definition records A B store the component having a name component type as a first component followed by any component having an alias component type followed by any component having an informational field component type followed by any component having a service component type and followed by any component having a component type for other information.

GUI can include a creation status bar that displays the various stages for creating entity definition s using the GUI. For example when the import file icon is selected the stages that pertain to creating entity definition s using a file are displayed in the status bar . The stages can include for example and are not limited to an initial stage an import file stage a specify columns stage a merge entities stage and a completion stage. The status bar can be updated to display an indicator e.g. shaded circle corresponding to a current stage. When the search icon is selected the stages that pertain to creating entity definition s using search results are displayed in the status bar as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI includes a next button which when selected displays the next GUI for creating the entity definition s . GUI includes a previous button which when selected displays the previous GUI for creating the entity definition s . In one implementation if no icon e.g. icon icon is selected a default selection is used and if the next button is activated the GUI corresponding to the default selection is displayed. In one implementation the import file icon is the default selection. The default selection can be configurable.

GUI can include a status bar that is updated to display an indicator e.g. shaded circle corresponding to the current stage e.g. import file stage . User input can be received specifying the selected file. For example if the select file button is activated a GUI that allows a user to select a file is displayed. The GUI can display a list of directories and or files. In another example the user input may be a file being dragged to the drag and drop portion of the GUI .

The selected file can be a delimited file. GUI can facilitate user input identifying a quote character and a separator character that is being used for the selected file. The separator character is the character that is being used as a data item delimiter to separate data items in the selected file. For example user input can be received identifying a comma character as the separator character being used in the selected file.

At times the separator character e.g. comma character may be part of a data item. For example if the separator character is a comma character and the data item in the file may be joe machine . In such a case the comma character in the joe machine should not be treated as a separator character and should be treated as part of the data item itself. In the delimited file such situations are addressed by using special characters e.g. quotes around a data item that includes a comma character . Quote characters in GUI indicate that a separator character inside a data item surrounded by those quote characters should not be treated as a separator but rather part of the data item itself. Example quote characters can include and are not limited to single quote characters double quote characters slash characters and asterisk characters. The quote characters to be used can be specified via user input. For example user input may be received designating single quote characters to be used as quote characters in the delimited file. If a file has been selected and if the next button has been activated the data items from the selected file can be imported to a table. The table containing the imported data items can be displayed in a GUI as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI can facilitate user input for creating one or more entity definition records using the data items from a file. Entity definition records are stored in a data store. The entity definition records that are created as a result of user input that is received via GUI can replace any existing entity definition records in the data store can be added as new entity definition records to the data store and or can be combined with any existing entity definition records in the data store. The type of entity definition records that are to be created can be based on user input. GUI can include a button which when selected can display a list of record type options as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Referring to GUI can display a table that has automatically been populated with data items that have been imported from a selected file e.g. file in . Table includes columns A D a column identifier row A containing element names A D for the columns A D and another column identifier row B containing component types A D for the columns A D.

The data items e.g. IP IP2 user and name in of the first entry e.g. first entry A in can automatically be imported as the element names A D into the column identifier row A in the table . The placement of the data items e.g. IP IP2 user and name within the column identifier row A is based on the matching of ordinal positions of the element names A D within the column identifier row A to the ordinal positions of the data items within the first entry e.g. entry A of of the selected file.

GUI includes input text boxes A D to receive user input of user selected element names for the columns A D. In one implementation user input of an element name that is received via a text box A D overrides the element names e.g. IP IP2 user and name that that are imported from the data items in the first header row in the file. As discussed above an element name element value pair that is defined for an entity definition component via GUI can be used as a field value pair for a search query. An element name in the file may not correspond to an existing field name. A user e.g. business analyst can change the element name via a text box A D to a name that maps to an existing or desired field name. The mapping of an element name to an existing field name is not limited to a one to one mapping. For example a user may rename IP to dest via text box A and may also rename IP2 to dest via text box B.

The data items of the subsequent entries in the file can automatically be imported into the table . The placement of the data items of the subsequent entries into a particular row in the table can be based on the matching of ordinal positions of the data rows A B within the table to the ordinal positions of the entries within the file. The placement of the data items into a particular column within the table can be based on the matching of the ordinal positions of the columns A D within the table to the ordinal positions of the data items within a particular entry in the file.

User input designating the entity definition component types A D in the table is received via the GUI. In one implementation a button for each column A D can be selected to display a list of component types to select from. illustrates an example of a GUI of a service monitoring system for displaying a list of entity definition component types in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. List can include an alias component type a name component type an informational field component type and an import option indicating that the data items in a file that correspond to a particular column in the table should not be imported for creating an entity definition record. In one implementation GUI includes buttons which when selected displays service and description drop down columns.

As discussed above entity definition records are stored in a data store. The entity definition records that are created as a result of user input that is received via GUI can be added as new entity definition records to the data store can replace any existing entity definition records in the data store and or can be combined with any existing entity definition records in the data store. The list can include an option for to append the created entity definition records to the data store to replace existing entity definition records in the data store with the created entity definition records and to combine the created entity definition records with existing entity definition records in the data store. In one implementation the record type is set to a default type. In one implementation the default record type is set to the replacement type. The default record type is configurable.

When the append option is selected the entity definition records e.g. records A B in that are created as a result of using the GUI are added as new entity definition records to the data store.

When the replace option is selected one or more of the entity definition records that are created as a result of using the GUI replace existing entity definition records in the data store that match one or more element values in the newly created records. In one implementation an entire entity definition record that exists in the data store is replaced with a new entity definition record. In another implementation one or more components of an entity definition record that exist in the data store are replaced with corresponding components of a new entity definition record.

In one implementation the match is based on the element value for the name component in the entity definition records. A search of the data store can be executed to search for existing entity definition records that have an element value for a name component that matches the element value for the name component of a newly created entity definition record. For example two entity definition records are created via GUI . A first record has an element value of foobar for the name component of the record. The first record also includes an alias component having the element name IP2 and element value of 2.2.2.2 and another alias component having the element name IP and element value of 1.1.1.1 . There may be an existing entity definition record in the data store that has a matching element value of foobar for the name component. The existing entity definition record in the data store may have an alias component having the element name IP2 but may have an element value of 5.5.5.5 . The element value of 2.2.2.2 for the element name IP2 in the new entity definition record can replace the element value of 5.5.5.5 in the existing entity definition record.

When the combine option is selected one or more of the entity definition records that are created as a result of using the GUI can be combined with a corresponding entity definition record which exists in the data store and has a matching element value for a name component. For example a new entity definition record has an element value of foobar for the name component of the record. The first record also includes an alias component having the element name IP2 and element value of 2.2.2.2 and another alias component having the element name IP and element value of 1.1.1.1 . There may be an existing entity definition record in the data store that has a matching element value of foobar for the name component. The existing entity definition record in the data store may have an alias component having the element name IP2 but may have an element value of 5.5.5.5 . The element value of 2.2.2.2 for the element name IP2 in the new entity definition record can be added as another element value in the existing entity definition record for the alias component having the element name IP2 as described above in conjunction with alias component B in . In one implementation if an alias component stores an element name of IP2 and multiple element values 2.2.2.2 and 5.5.5.5 and when the element name element value pair is used for a search query the search query uses the values disjunctively. For example a search query may search for fields named IP2 and having either a 2.2.2.2 value or a 5.5.5.5 value.

If input of the selected file has been received and if the next button has been selected a GUI for merging entity definition records is displayed as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI can include information pertaining to the entity definition records that have been imported into the data store. The information can include the number of records that have been imported. In one implementation the information includes the type e.g. replace append combine of import that has been made. If button is selected GUI for editing the entity definition records can be displayed. illustrates an example of a GUI of a service monitoring system for creating and or editing entity definition record s in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. GUI displays a portion of a list of the entity definition records that are stored in the data store. A button for an entity definition record in the list can be selected and a GUI for editing the selected entity definition record can be displayed.

Referring to as described above the selected file e.g. file in that was used to import entity definition records in to the data store may be a file that is generated by a source e.g. inventory system . The file may be periodically output by the source e.g. inventory system and a user e.g. business analyst may wish to execute another import using the newly outputted file from the source. The configuration e.g. selected component types selected type of import etc. of the current import that was executed using the file can be saved for future execution using an updated file.

If button is selected GUI in can be displayed to save the configuration of the current import that was executed using the file as a new modular input that can be used for future imports using new versions of the file.

A user e.g. business analyst can provide a name for modular input and metadata information for the modular input such as an entity type for the modular input. When the create button is selected a modular input GUI is displayed for setting the parameters for monitoring the file.

The monitoring of a file e.g. file in to determine whether the file has changed can run at a particular interval. A user can provide input of the interval via GUI in . In one implementation a change is when new data is found in the file. In another implementation a change is when data has been removed from the file. In one implementation a change includes data being added to the file and data being removed from the file. In one implementation when a change is identified in the file new entity definition records that reflect the change can be imported into the data store. Depending on the import type that has been saved in the modular input the new entity definition records can automatically replace append or be combined with existing entity definition records in the data store. For example the append option has been saved in the modular input settings and will be used for imports that occur when the file has changed. When a change has been detected in the file new entity definition records will automatically be appended e.g. added to the data store. In one implementation when a change has been detected in the file that pertains to data being removed from the file the import of the new entity definition records which reflect the removed data into the data store does not occur automatically.

At block the computing machine performs a search query to produce a search result set. The search query can be performed in response to user input. The user input can include a user selection of the type of search query to use for creating entity definitions. The search query can be an ad hoc search or a saved search. A saved search is a search query that has search criteria which has been previously defined and is stored in a data store. An ad hoc search is a new search query where the search criteria are specified from user input that is received via a graphical user interface GUI . Implementations for receiving user input for the search query via a GUI are described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

In one implementation the search query is directed to searching machine data. As described above the computing machine can be coupled to an event processing system e.g. event processing system in . Machine data can be represented as events. Each of the events can include raw data. The event processing system can apply a late binding schema to the events to extract values for fields defined by the schema and determine which events have values that are extracted for a field. The search criteria for the search query can specify a name of one or more fields defined by the schema and a corresponding value for the field name. The field value pairs in the search query can be used to search the machine data for the events that have matching values for the fields named in search criteria. For example the search criteria may include the field name role and the value indexer. The computing machine can execute the search query and return a search result set that includes events with the value indexer in the associated field named role. 

In one implementation the search query is directed to search a data store storing service monitoring data pertaining to the service monitoring system. The service monitoring data can include and is not limited to entity definition records service definition records key performance indicator KPI specifications and KPI thresholding information. The data in the data store can be based on one or more schemas and the search criteria for the search query can include identifiers e.g. field names element names etc. for searching the data based on the one or more schemas. For example the search criteria can include a name of one or more elements defined by the schema for entity definition records and a corresponding value for the element name. The element name element value pair in the search query can be used to search the entity definition records for the records that have matching values for the elements named in search criteria.

The search result set can be in a tabular format and can include one or more entries. Each entry includes one or more data items. The search query can search for information pertaining to an IT environment. For example the search query may return a search result set that includes information for various entities e.g. physical machines virtual machines APIs processes etc. in an IT environment and various characteristics e.g. name aliases user role owner operating system etc. for each entity. One or more entries in the search result set can correspond to entities. Each entry can include one or more data items. As discussed above an entity has one or more characteristics e.g. name alias informational field service association and or other information . Each data item in an entry in the search result set can correspond to a characteristic of a particular entity.

Each entry in the search result set has an ordinal position within the search result set and each data item has an ordinal position within the corresponding entry in the search result set. An ordinal position is a specified position in a numbered series. Each entry in the search result set can have the same number of data items. Alternatively the number of data items per entry can vary.

At block the computing machine creates a table having one or more rows and one or more columns in each row. The number of rows in the table can be based on the number of entries in the search result set and the number of columns in the table can be based on the number of data items within an entry in the search result set e.g. the number of data items in an entry having the most data items . Each row has an ordinal position within the table and each column has an ordinal position within the table.

At block the computing machine associates the entries in the search result set with corresponding rows in the table based on the ordinal positions of the entries within the search result set and the ordinal positions of the rows within the table. For each entry the computing machine matches the ordinal position of the entry with the ordinal position of one of the rows. The matched ordinal positions need not be equal in an implementation and one may be calculated from the other using for example an offset value.

At block for each entry in the search result set the computing machine imports each of the data items of a particular entry in the search result set into a respective column of the same row of the table. An example of importing the data items of a particular entry to populate a respective column of a same row of a table is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing system causes display in a GUI of one or more rows of the table populated with data items imported from the search result set. An example GUI presenting a table with data items imported from a search result set is described in greater detail below in conjunction with and .

At block the computing machine receives user input designating for each of one or more respective columns an element name and a type of entity definition component to which the respective column pertains. As discussed above an entity definition component type represents a particular characteristic type e.g. name alias information service association etc. of an entity. An element name represents a name of an element associated with a corresponding characteristic of an entity. For example the entity definition component type may be an alias component type and an element associated with an alias of an entity may be an element name role .

The user input designating for each respective column an element name and a type e.g. name alias informational field service association and other of entity definition component to which the respective column pertains can be received via the GUI. One implementation of user input designating for each respective column an element name and a type of entity definition component to which the respective column pertains is discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine stores for each of one or more of the data items of the particular entry of the search result set a value of an element of an entity definition. I data item will be stored if it appeared in a column for which a proper element name and entity definition component type were specified. As discussed above an entity definition includes one or more components. Each component stores information pertaining to an element. The element of the entity definition has the element name designated for the respective column in which the data item appeared. The element of the entity definition is associated with an entity definition component having the type designated for the respective column in which the data item appeared. The element names and the values for the elements can be stored in an entity definition data store which may be a relational database e.g. SQL server or a document oriented database e.g. MongoDB for example.

The first entry A in the search result set may be a header entry. The data items e.g. serverName role and owner in the header entry A can be names defining the types of data items in the search result set .

A table can be displayed in a GUI. The table can include one or more rows. In one implementation a top row in the table is a column identifier row and each subsequent row is a data row. A column identifier row contains column identifiers such as an element name A C and an entity definition component type A C for each column A C in the table . User input can be received via the GUI for designating the element names A C and component types A C for each column A C.

In one implementation the data items of the first entry e.g. entry A in the search result set are automatically imported as the element names A C into the column identifier row in the table and user input is received via the GUI that indicates acceptance of using the data items of the first entry A in the search result set as the element names A C in the table . For example a user selection of a save button or a next button in a GUI can indicate acceptance. In one implementation user input designating the component types is also received via the GUI. One implementation of a GUI facilitating user input for designating the element names and component types for each column is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The determination of how to import a data item from the search result set to a particular location in the table is based on ordinal positions of the data items within a respective entry in the search result set and ordinal positions of columns within the table . In one implementation ordinal positions of the entries A B within the search result set and ordinal positions of the rows e.g. row row within the table are used to determine how to import a data item from the search result set into the table .

Each of the entries and data items in the search result set has an ordinal position. Each of the rows and columns in the table has an ordinal position. In one implementation the first position in a numbered series is zero. In another implementation the first position in a numbered series is one.

For example each entry A B in the search result set has an ordinal position within the search result set . In one implementation the top entry in the search result set has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent entry has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the entry having the first position. For example for search result set entry A has an ordinal position of one and entry B has an ordinal position of two.

Each data item in an entry A B has an ordinal position within the respective entry. In one implementation the left most data item in an entry has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent data item has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the data item having the first position. For example for entry A serverName has an ordinal position of one role has an ordinal position of two and owner has an ordinal position of three.

Each row in the table has an ordinal position within the table . In one implementation the top row in the table has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent row has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the row having the first position. For example for table row has an ordinal position of one and row has an ordinal position of two.

Each column in the table has an ordinal position within the table . In one implementation the left most column in the table has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent column has a corresponding position in the number series relative to the column having the first position. For example for table column A has an ordinal position of one column B has an ordinal position of two and column C has an ordinal position of three.

Each element name A C in the table has an ordinal position within the table . In one implementation the left most element name in the table has a first position in a numbered series and each subsequent element name has a corresponding position in the numbered series relative to the element name having the first position. For example for table element name A has an ordinal position of one element name B has an ordinal position of two and element name C has an ordinal position of three.

The ordinal positions of the rows in the table and the ordinal positions of the entries A B in the search result set can correspond to each other. The ordinal positions of the columns in the table and the ordinal positions of the data items in the search result set can correspond to each other. The ordinal positions of the element names in the table and the ordinal positions of the data items in the search result set can correspond to each other.

The determination of an element name GUI element A C in which to place a data item when importing a search results entry that contains the element column names can be based on the ordinal position of the entity name A C that corresponds to the ordinal position of the data item. For example serverName has an ordinal position of one within entry A in the search result set . Element name A has an ordinal position that matches the ordinal position of serverName . serverName can be imported from the search result set and placed in element name A in row .

The data items for a particular entry in the search result set can appear in the same row in the table . The determination of a row in which to place the data items for the particular entry can be based on the ordinal position of the row that corresponds to the ordinal position of the entry. For example entry B has an ordinal position of two. Row has an ordinal position that matches the ordinal position of entry B. The data items jdoe mbp15r.splunk.com search head indexer and jdoe can be imported from entry B in the search result set and placed in row in the table .

The determination of a column in which to place a particular data item can be based on the ordinal position of the column within the table that corresponds to the ordinal position of the data items within a particular entry in the search result set . For example the data item jdoe mbp15r.splunk.com in entry B has an ordinal position of one. Column A has an ordinal position that matches the ordinal position of jdoe mbp15r.splunk.com . The data item jdoe mbp15r.splunk.com can be imported from the search result set and placed in row and in column A.

User input designating the component types A C in the table is received via the GUI. For example a selection of Name is received for component type A a selection of Alias is received for component type B and a selection of Informational Field is received for component type C. One implementation of a GUI facilitating user input for designating the component types for each column is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Corresponding ordinal positions need not be equal in an implementation and one may be calculated from the other using for example an offset value.

User input can be received via the GUI for creating entity definitions records such as using the element names A C component types A C and data items displayed in the table and importing the entity definitions records such as in a data store as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

When user input designating the entity definition component types A C for the table is received and user input indicating acceptance of the display of the data items from search result set into the table is received the entity definition record s can be created and stored. For example the entity definition record is created.

As described above in one implementation an entity definition stores no more than one component having a name component type. The entity definition can store zero or more components having an alias component type and can store zero or more components having an informational field component type. In one implementation user input is received via a GUI e.g. entity definition editing GUI service definition GUI to add one or more service association components and or one or more other information components to an entity definition record. While not explicitly shown in the illustrative example of the teachings regarding the importation of component information into entity definition records from search query results can understandably be applied to service association component information after the fashion illustrated for alias and informational field component information for example.

In one implementation an entity definition record e.g. entity definition record stores the component having a name component type as a first component followed by any component having an alias component type followed by any component having an informational field component type followed by any component having a service component type and followed by any component having a component type for other information.

GUI can be displayed for example if search icon in is selected as described above. GUI can include a status bar that is updated to display an indicator e.g. shaded circle corresponding to the current stage e.g. search stage . The stages can include for example and are not limited to an initial stage a search stage a specify columns stage a merge entities stage and a completion stage. GUI includes a next button which when selected displays the next GUI for creating the entity definition s . GUI includes a previous button which when selected displays the previous GUI for creating the entity definition s .

The search query can be an ad hoc search or a saved search. As described above a saved search is a search query that has search criteria which has been previously defined and is stored in a data store. An ad hoc search is a new search query where the search criteria are specified from user input that is received via a graphical user interface GUI .

If the ad hoc search button is selected user input can be received via text box indicating search language that defines the search criteria for the ad hoc search query. If the saved search button is selected GUI in is displayed.

Referring to the search query can be directed to search machine data that is stored in a data store and or service monitoring data e.g. entity definition records service definition records etc. that is stored in a data store. The data e.g. machine data service monitoring data used by a search query to produce a search result set can be based on a time range. The time range can be a user defined time range or a default time range. The default time range can be configurable. GUI can include a button which when selected displays a list of time ranges to select from. For example a user may select via the button the time range Last 1 day and when the search query is executed the search query will search data e.g. machine data service monitoring data from the last one day.

When a search query has been defined for example as user input received for an ad hoc search via text box or from a selection of a saved search and when a time range has been selected the search query can be executed in response to the activation of button . The search result set produced by performing the search query can be displayed in a results portion of the GUI as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

In one implementation when a saved search is selected from the list of the search language defining the search criteria for the selected save search is displayed in the text box . For example the search language that defines the Get indexer entities saved search is shown displayed in text box . In one implementation user input can be received via text box to edit the saved search.

The search language that defines the search query can include a command to output the search result set in a tabular format having one or more rows row row and one or more columns e.g. columns A C for each row. The search language defining the Get indexer entities search query can include commands and values that specify the number of columns and the column identifiers for the search result set. For example the search language in text box may include table serverName role owner . In one implementation if the search query definition does not output a table an error message is displayed.

The Get indexer entities saved search searches for events that have the value indexer in the field named role. For example the search language in text box may include search role indexer . When the Get indexer entities search query is performed GUI displays a search result set that is a table having a first entry as the column identifier row and a second entry as a data row which represents the one event that has the value indexer in the field named role. 

The second entry shown as a data row has data items jdoe mbp15r.sv.splulnk.com search head indexer and jdoe that correspond to the columns. As described above the command in the search query definition may include table serverName role owner and the column identifier row can include serverName A role B and owner C as column identifiers. The entries and data items in the search result set can be imported into a user interactive table for creating entity definitions as described below. GUI includes a next button which when selected displays GUI in that translates the entries and data items in the search result set into a table for creating entity definitions.

GUI can facilitate user input for creating one or more entity definition records using the data items from a search result set e.g. search result set in . Entity definition records are stored in a data store. The entity definition records that are created as a result of user input that is received via GUI can replace any existing entity definition records in the data store can be added as new entity definition records to the data store and or can be combined with any existing entity definition records in the data store. The type of entity definition records that are to be created can be based on user input. GUI can include a button which when selected can display a list of record type options as described above in conjunction with button in .

Referring to GUI can display a table that has automatically been populated with data items that have been imported from a search result set e.g. search result set in . Table includes columns A C a column identifier row A containing element names A C for the columns A C and another column identifier row B containing component types A C for the columns A C.

The data items e.g. serverName A role B user and owner C in of the first entry e.g. first entry in row in can automatically be imported as the element names A C into the column identifier row A in the table . The placement of the data items e.g. serverName role and owner within the column identifier row A is based on the matching of ordinal positions of the element names A C within the column identifier row A to the ordinal positions of the data items within the first entry e.g. first entry in row in of the search result set.

The data items of the subsequent entries e.g. second entry in row in in the search result set can automatically be imported into the table . The placement of the data items of the subsequent entries into a particular row in the table can be based on the matching of ordinal positions of the data rows within the table to the ordinal positions of the entries within the search result set. The placement of the data items into a particular column within the table can be based on the matching of the ordinal positions of the columns A D within the table to the ordinal positions of the data items within a particular entry in the search result set.

User input designating the entity definition component types A C in the table is received via the GUI. In one implementation a button for each column A C can be selected to display a list of component types to select from as described above in conjunction with . The list of component types can include an alias component type a name component type an informational field component type and an import option indicating that the data items in a search result set that correspond to a particular column in the table should not be imported for creating an entity definition record.

If the next button has been selected a GUI for merging entity definition records is displayed as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

If a user does not wish to import the entity definition records into the data store the previous button can be selected to display the previous GUI e.g. GUI in and the user may edit the configuration e.g. record type component type etc. of the import. If a user wishes to import the entity definition records into the data store the submit button can be selected to import the entity definition records into the data store. If the submit button is selected GUI in can be displayed.

GUI can include information pertaining to the entity definition records that have been imported into the data store. The information can include the number of records that have been imported. In one implementation the information includes the type e.g. replace append combine of import that has been made. If button is selected GUI for editing the entity definition records can be displayed as described above in conjunction with .

Referring to the search query e.g. search query defined in GUI in that was used to produce the search result set for importing entity definition record s in to the data store may be executed periodically. The search result set may differ from when the search query was previously run. A user e.g. business analyst may wish to execute another import using the new search result set that is produced from another execution of the search query. The configuration e.g. selected component types selected type of import etc. of the current import that was executed using the search query can be saved for future execution.

If button is selected GUI in can be displayed to save the configuration of the current import that was executed using a search query as a saved search. The saved search can be used for future imports using contemporaneous versions of the search result set that is produced by the saved search.

A user e.g. business analyst can provide a name for the saved search. When the create button is selected a saved search GUI is displayed for setting the parameters for the saved search as described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

User input can be received via text box for a description of the saved search that is being created. User input can be received via a list for the type of schedule to use for executing the search query. The list can include a Cron schedule type and a basic schedule type. For example if the basic schedule type is selected user input may be received specifying that the search query should be performed every day or if the Cron schedule type is selected user input may be received specifying scheduling information in a format compatible with an operating system job scheduler.

The search result set that is produced by executing the search query can be monitored for changes. In one implementation a change is when new data is found in the search result set. In another implementation a change is when data has been removed from the search result set. In one implementation a change includes data being added to the search result set or data being removed from the search result set.

In one implementation when a change is identified in the search result set new entity definition records that reflect the change can be imported into the data store. Depending on the import type that has been saved in the search query definition the new entity definition records can automatically replace append or be combined with existing entity definition records in the data store. For example the append option may have been saved in the search query definition and will be used for imports that occur when the search result set has changed. In one implementation when a change has been detected in the search result set new entity definition records will automatically be appended e.g. added to the data store. In one implementation when a change has been detected in the search result set that pertains to data being removed from the search result set the import of the new entity definition records which reflect the removed data into the data store does not occur automatically.

As discussed above an event processing system e.g. event processing system in may include a machine data store that stores machine data represented as machine data events. An entity definition of an entity providing one or more services may include information for associating a subset of the machine data events in the machine data store with that entity. An entity definition of an entity specifies one or more characteristics of the entity such as a name one or more aliases for the entity one or more informational fields for the entity one or more services associated with the entity and other information pertaining to the entity. An informational field is an entity definition component for storing user defined metadata for a corresponding entity which includes information about the entity that may not be reliably present in or may be absent altogether from the machine data events.

At block the computing machine creates an associated pair of data items. In one embodiment the associated pair of data items may include a key representing a metadata field name and a value representing a metadata value for the metadata field. At block the computing machine adds the associated pair of data items to an entity definition for a corresponding entity. In one embodiment the entity definition is stored in a service monitoring data store separate from a machine data store. The associated pair of the metadata field name and value can be added to the entity definition as an entity definition component type informational field. The metadata data field name can represent an element name of the informational field also referred to as info field and the metadata field value can represent an element value of the informational field. Some other components of the entity definition may include the entity name one or more aliases of the entity and one or more services provided by the entity as shown in . The metadata field and metadata value may be added to the informational field component of the entity definition based on user input to provide additional information about the entity that may be useful in searches of an event store including machine data events pertaining to the entity in searches for entities or entity definitions in information visualizations or other actions. For example the entity definition may be created for a particular server machine and the informational field may be added to specify an operating system of that server machine e.g. the metadata field name of operating system and the metadata field value of Linux which may not be part of machine data events pertaining to the entity represented by the entity definition.

At block the computing machine exposes the added informational field for use by a search query. In one embodiment entity aliases may be exposed for use by a search query as part of the same process. S In one embodiment exposing the added informational field or alias for use by a search query includes modifying an API to for example support a behavior for specifically retrieving the field name the field value or both of the information field or alias . In one embodiment exposing the added informational field or alias for use by a search query includes storing the informational field or alias information at a particular logical location within an entity definition such as an information field or alias component. In such a case certain processing of blocks and may be accomplished by a single action.

In one implementation an alias can include a key value pair comprised of an alias name and an alias value. Some examples of the alias name can include an identifier ID number a hostname an IP internet protocol address etc. A service definition of a service provided by the entity specifies an entity definition of the entity and when a search of the machine data store is performed for example to obtain information pertaining to performance characteristics of the service an exposed alias from the entity definition can be used by the search to arrive at those machine data events in the machine data store that are associated with the entity providing the service. Furthermore storing the informational field in the entity definition together with the aliases can expose the pair of data items that make up the informational field for use by the search to attribute the metadata field and metadata value to each machine data event associated with the entity providing the service. In one example a search for information pertaining to performance characteristics of a service provided by multiple entities e.g. multiple virtual machines may use the information field name and value to further filter the search result. For example by including an additional criterion of os linux where os is the metadata field name and linux is the metadata value of the information field in a search query a search result may only include performance characteristics of those virtual machines of the service that run the Linux guest operating system.

In one implementation the informational field can be used to search for specific entities or entity definitions. For example a user can submit a search query including a criterion of os linux to find entity definitions of entities running the Linux operating system as will be discussed in more detail below in conjunction with .

Info Fields GUI fields may receive user input of an information field name value pair. The informational field name value pair may be added to the entity definition to store user defined metadata for the entity which includes information about the entity that may not be reliably not present in or may be absent altogether from the machine data events pertaining to that entity. The informational field name value pair may include data about the entity that may be useful in searches of an event store including machine data events pertaining to the entity in searches for entities or entity definitions in information visualizations or other actions. GUI can allow a user to add multiple informational fields for the entity.

Upon entering the above characteristics of the entity the user can request that the entity definition be created e.g. by selecting the Create Entity button . In response the entity definition is created using for example the structure described above in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine receives a search query for selecting events from the machine data store that satisfy one or more event selection criteria of the search query. The event selection criteria include a first field value pair. The first field value pair may include a name of a specific entity characteristic e.g. OS owner etc. and a value of a specific entity characteristic e.g. Linux Brent etc. . In one implementation the event selection criteria may be part of a search query entered by a user in a search field provided in a user interface.

At block the computing machine performs the search query to determine if events in a machine data store satisfy the event selection criteria in the search query including the first field value pair. Determining whether one of the events satisfies the event selection criteria can involve comparing the first field value pair of the event selection criteria with a second field value pair from an entity definition associated with the event by using a third field value pair from data corresponding to the event in the machine data store. In particular in one implementation an entity definition is located that has the second field value pair matching the first field value pair from the search criteria. The second field value pair may include a metadata field name and metadata value that match the query field name and query value respectively. In one implementation the metadata field name and metadata value may be an informational field that was added to the entity definition as described above with respect to . The identified entity definition may include a third field value pair e.g. an alias that includes an alias name and alias value. This third field value pair denotes an additional way to reference the entity using data found in event records pertaining to the entity. Using this alias the events in the machine data store that correspond to the entity definition can be identified and the informational field the second field value pair can be attributed to those events indicating that those events satisfy at least a part of the event selection criteria that includes the first field value pair. If the event selection criteria includes at least one other event selection criterion a further determination can be made as to whether the above events satisfy the at least one other event selection criteria.

At block the computing machine returns a search query result pertaining to events that satisfy the event selection criteria received in the search query. For example the search result can include at least portions of the events that satisfy the event selection the number of the events that satisfy the event selection criteria e.g. 0 1 . . . 100 etc. or any other pertinent data.

Referring again to an entity definition includes an alias and info field . Referring now again to if a search query is submitted with an event selection criteria including owner brent a first field value pair a data store including various entity definitions is searched to find at least one entity definition having an information field a second field value pair that matches the first field value pair of owner brent. As a result entity definition is located and alias a third field value pair is obtained and used to arrive at events in the machine data store that include a value matching 1.1.1.1 in the field named ip. Those events satisfy at least a part of the event selection criteria that includes the first field value pair. Alternate orders for satisfying individual search criteria during a search are possible.

In some implementations informational fields can also be used to filter entities or entity definitions. In particular a service monitoring data store can be searched for entities or entity definitions having an informational field that matches one or more search criteria.

Referring to GUI also includes a search field . Search field can receive user input including a search query command e.g. getentity or getentity generate as well as selection criteria including a first field value pair. As described above execution of the getentity or getentity generate command returns all or a subset of all entity definitions that have been created. The inclusion of the selection criteria e.g. search os linux further filters the results of the getentity or getentity generate command to limit the returned entity definitions to those having an informational field value pair that matches the selection criteria. A corresponding entry for each filtered entity definition may be displayed in search results region of GUI . In one implementation various columns are displayed for each entry in search results region including for example informational field column and alias columns and . In the illustrated example there is only one entry in search results region indicating that only one entity definition included an informational field value pair that matched the selection criteria entered in search field . As shown the entry includes an information field column named os which includes the value of linux. This metadata field name and metadata value match the query field name and query value i.e. os linux from the event selection criteria. In the illustrated example the entry also includes at least two alias columns and . These alias columns dest mac and src mac include alias values e.g. 10 10 10 10 40 40 that can be used to locate events in a machine data store that satisfy the event selection criteria. By having the information field and aliases stored as part of the entity definition the informational field values can be associated with the events that are determined to correspond to the entity using an alias. Upon having identified the entity definition the computing machine can locate and return events from the machine data store that satisfy the event selection criteria. As such the user can filter events using the information fields.

Embodiments are possible where the entity name as represented in the entity name component of an entity definition may be treated as a de facto entity alias. This is useful where the value of the entity name is likely to appear in event data and so like an alias value can be used to identify an event with the entity. Accordingly one of skill recognizes that foregoing teachings about aliases can be sensibly expanded to include entity names.

At block the computing machine receives input of a title for referencing a service definition for a service. At block the computing machine receives input identifying one or more entities providing the service and associates the identified entities with the service definition of the service at block .

At block the computing machine creates one or more key performance indicators for the service and associates the key performance indicators with the service definition of the service at block . Some implementations of creating one or more key performance indicators are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine receives input identifying one or more other services which the service is dependent upon and associates the identified other services with the service definition of the service at block . The computing machine can include an indication in the service definition that the service is dependent on another service for which a service definition has been created.

At block the computing machine can optionally define an aggregate KPI score to be calculated for the service to indicate an overall performance of the service. The score can be a value for an aggregate of the KPIs for the service. The aggregate KPI score can be periodically calculated for continuous monitoring of the service. For example the aggregate KPI score for a service can be updated in real time continuously updated until interrupted . In one implementation the aggregate KPI score for a service is updated periodically e.g. every second . Some implementations of determining an aggregate KPI score for the service are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI can include a drop down for receiving input for creating one or more KPIs for the service. If the drop down is selected GUI in is displayed as described in greater detail below.

GUI can include a drop down for receiving input for specifying dependencies for the service. If the drop down is selected GUI in is displayed as described in greater detail below.

GUI can include one or more buttons to specify whether entities are associated with the service. A selection of No indicates that the service is not associated with any entities and the service definition is not associated with any entity definitions. For example a service may not be associated with any entities if an end user intends to use the service and corresponding service definition for testing purposes and or experimental purposes. In another example a service may not be associated with any entities if the service is dependent one or more other services and the service is being monitored via the entities of the one or more other services upon which the service depends upon. For example an end user may wish to use a service without entities as a way to track a business service based on the services which the business service depends upon. If Yes is selected GUI in is displayed as described in greater detail below.

Referring to GUI can include an availability list of entity definitions for entities which can be selected to be associated with the service definition. The availability list can include one or more entity definitions. For example the availability list may include thousands of entity definitions. GUI can include a filter box to receive input for filtering the availability list of entity definitions to display a portion of the entity definitions. Each entity definition in the availability list can include the entity definition name and the entity type . GUI can facilitate user input for selecting an entity definition from the availability list and dragging the selected entity definition to a selected list to indicate that the entity for the selected entity definition is associated with service of the service definition. For example entity definition e.g. webserver01.splunk.com can be selected and dragged to the selected list .

The service definition structure includes one or more components. Each service definition component relates to a characteristic of the service. For example there is a service name component one or more entity filter criteria components A B one or more entity association indicator components one or more KPI components one or more service dependencies components and one or more components for other information . The characteristic of the service being represented by a particular component is the particular service definition component s type. In one implementation the entity filter criteria components A are stored in a service definition. In another implementation the entity filter criteria components B are stored in association with a service definition e.g. separately from the service definition but linked to the service definition using for example identifiers of the entity filter criteria components B and or an identifier of the service definition .

The entity definitions that are associated with a service definition can change. In one implementation as described above in conjunction with users can manually and explicitly select entity definitions from a list e.g. list in GUI in of pre defined entities to include in a service definition to reflect the environment changes. In another implementation the entity filter criteria component s A B can include filter criteria that can be used for automatically identifying one or more entity definitions to be associated with the service definition without user interaction. The filter criteria in the entity filter criteria components A B can be processed to search the entity definitions that are stored in a service monitoring data store for any entity definitions that satisfy the filter criteria. The entity definitions that satisfy the filter criteria can be associated with the service definition. The entity association indicator component s can include information that identifies the one or more entity definitions that satisfy the filter criteria and associates those entity definitions with the service definition thereby creating an association between a service and one or more entities. One implementation for using filter criteria and entity association indicators to identify entity definition s and to associate the identified entity definition s with a service definition is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The KPI component s can include information that describes one or more KPIs for monitoring the service. As described above a KPI is a type of performance measurement. For example various aspects e.g. CPU usage memory usage response time etc. of the service can be monitored using respective KPIs.

The service dependencies component s can include information describing one or more other services for which the service is dependent upon and or one or more other services which depend on the service being represented by the service definition. In one implementation a service definition specifies one or more other services which a service depends upon and does not associate any entities with the service as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . In another implementation a service definition specifies a service as a collection of one or more other services and one or more entities. Each service definition component stores information for an element. The information can include an element name and one or more element values for the element.

In one implementation the element name element value pair s within a service definition component serves as a field name field value pair for a search query. In one implementation the search query is directed to search a service monitoring data store storing service monitoring data pertaining to the service monitoring system. The service monitoring data can include and is not limited to entity definition service definitions and key performance indicator KPI specifications.

In one example an element name element value pair in the entity filter criteria component A B in the service definition can be used to search the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store for the entity definitions that have matching values for the elements that are named in the entity filter criteria component A B.

Each entity filter criteria component A B corresponds to a rule for applying one or more filter criteria defined by the element name element value pair to the entity definitions. A rule for applying filter criteria can include an execution type and an execution parameter. User input can be received specifying filter criteria execution types and execution parameters via a graphical user interface GUI as described in greater detail below. The execution type specifies whether the rule for applying the filter criteria to the entity definitions should be executed dynamically or statically. For example the execution type can be static execution or dynamic execution. A rule having a static execution type can be executed to create associations between the service definition and the entity definitions on a single occurrence based on the content of the entity definitions in a service monitoring data store at the time the static rule is executed. A rule having a dynamic execution type can be initially executed to create current associations between the service definition and the entity definitions and can then be re executed to possibly modify those associations based on the then current content of the entity definitions in a service monitoring data store at the time of re execution. For example if the execution type is static execution the filter criteria can be applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store only once. If the execution type is dynamic execution the filter criteria can automatically be applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store repeatedly.

The execution parameter specifies when the filter criteria should be applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store. For example for a static execution type the execution parameter may specify that the filter criteria should be applied when the service definition is created or when a corresponding filter criteria component is added to or modified in the service definition. In another example for a static execution type the execution parameter may specify that the filter criteria should be applied when a corresponding KPI is first calculated for the service.

For a dynamic execution type the execution parameter may specify that the filter criteria should be applied each time a change to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store is detected. The change can include for example adding a new entity definition to the service monitoring data store editing an existing entity definition deleting an entity definition etc. In another example the execution parameter may specify that the filter criteria should be applied each time a corresponding KPI is calculated for the service.

In one implementation for each entity definition that has been identified as satisfying any of the filter criteria in the entity filter criteria components A B for a service an entity association indicator component is added to the service definition .

A service monitoring data store can store any number of entity definitions A B. As described above an entity definition A B can include an entity name component A B one or more alias components A D one or more informational field components one or more service association components A B and one or more other components for other information. A service definition can include one or more entity filter criteria components A B that can be used to associate one or more entity definitions A B with the service definition.

A service definition can include a single service name component that contains all of the identifying information e.g. name title key and or identifier for the service. The value for the name component type in a service definition can be used as the service identifier for the service being represented by the service definition. For example the service definition includes a single entity name component that has an element name of name and an element value of TestService . The value TestService becomes the service identifier for the service that is being represented by service definition .

There can be one or multiple components having the same service definition component type. For example the service definition has two entity filter criteria component types e.g. entity filter criteria components A B . In one implementation some combination of a single and multiple components of the same type are used to store information pertaining to a service in a service definition.

Each entity filter criteria component A B can store a single filter criterion or multiple filter criteria for identifying one or more of the entity definitions e.g. entity definitions A B . For example the entity filter criteria component A stores a single filter criterion that includes an element name dest and a single element value 192. A value can include one or more wildcard characters as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . The entity filter criterion in component A can be applied to the entity definitions A B to identify the entity definitions that satisfy the filter criterion dest 192. Specifically the element name element value pair can be used for a search query. For example a search query may search for fields named dest and containing a value that begins with the pattern 192. .

An entity filter criteria component that stores multiple filter criteria can include an element name and multiple values. In one implementation the multiple values are treated disjunctively. For example the entity filter criteria B include an element name name and multiple values 192.168.1.100 and hope.mbp14.local . The entity filter criteria in component B can be applied to the entity definition records A B to identify the entity definitions that satisfy the filter criteria name 192.168.1.100 or name hope.mbp14.local . Specifically the element name and element values can be used for a search query that uses the values disjunctively. For example a search query may search for fields in the service monitoring data store named name and having either a 192.168.1.100 or a hope.mbp14.local value.

An element name in the filter criteria in an entity filter criteria component A B can correspond to an element name in an entity name component e.g. entity name component A B an element name in an alias component e.g. alias component A D or an element name in an informational field component not shown in at least one entity definition A B in a service monitoring data store. The filter criteria can be applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store based on the execution type and execution parameter in the entity filter criteria component A B.

In one implementation an entity association indicator component A B is added to the service definition for each entity definition that satisfies any of the filter criteria in the entity filter criteria component A B for the service. The entity association indicator component A B can include an element name element value pair to associate the particular entity definition with the service definition. For example the entity definition record A satisfies the rule dest 192. and the entity association indicator component A is added to the service definition record to associate the entity definition record A with the TestService specified in the service definition record .

In one implementation for each entity definition that has been identified as satisfying any of the filter criteria in the entity filter criteria components A B for a service a service association component A B is added to the entity definition A B. The service association component A B can include an element name element value pair to associate the particular service definition with the entity definition A. For example the entity definition A satisfies the filter criterion dest 192. associated with the service definition and the service association component A is added to the entity definition A to associate the TestService with the entity definition A.

In one implementation the entity definitions A B that satisfy any of the filter criteria in the service definition are associated with the service definition automatically. For example an entity association indicator component A B can be automatically added to the service definition . In one example an entity association indicator component A B can be added to the service definition when the respective entity definition has been identified.

As described above the entity definitions A B can include alias components A D for associating machine data e.g. machine data 1 4 with a particular entity being represented by a respective entity definition A B. For example entity definition A includes alias component A B to associate machine data 1 and machine data 2 with the entity named foobar . When any of the entity definition components of an entity definition satisfy filter criteria in a service definition all of the machine data that is associated with the entity named foobar can be used for the service being represented by the service definition . For example the alias component A in the entity definition A satisfies the filter criteria in entity filter criteria A. If a KPI is being determined for the service TestService that is represented by service definition the KPI can be determined using machine data 1 and machine data 2 that are associated with the entity represented by the entity definition A even though only machine data 1 and not machine data 2 is associated with the entity represented by definition record A via alias A the alias used to associate entity definition record A with the service represented by definition record via filter criteria A .

When filter criteria in the entity filter criteria components A B are applied to the entity definitions dynamically changes that are made to the entity definitions A B in the service monitoring data store can be automatically captured by the entity filter criteria components A B and reflected for example in KPI determinations for the service even after the filter criteria have been defined. The entity definitions that satisfy filter criteria for a service can be associated with the respective service definition even if a new entity is created significantly after a rule has already been defined.

For example a new machine may be added to an IT environment and a new entity definition for the new machine may be added to the service monitoring data store. The new machine has an IP address containing 192. and may be associated with machine data X and machine data Y. The filter criteria in the entity filter criteria component can be applied to the service monitoring data store and the new machine can be identified as satisfying the filter criteria. The association of the new machine with the service definition for TestService is made without user interaction. An entity association indicator for the new machine can be added to the service definition and or a service association can be added to the entity definition of the new machine. A KPI for the TestService can be calculated that also takes into account machine data X and machine data Y for the new machine.

As described above in one implementation a service definition stores no more than one component having a name component type. The service definition can store zero or more components having an entity filter criteria component type and can store zero or more components having an informational field component type. In one implementation user input is received via a GUI e.g. service definition GUI to add one or more other service definition components to a service definition record.

Various implementations may use a variety of data representation and or organization for the component information in a service definition record based on such factors as performance data density site conventions and available application infrastructure for example. The structure e.g. structure in of a service definition can include rows entries or tuples to depict components of an entity definition. A service definition component can be a normalized tabular representation for the component as can be used in an implementation such as an implementation storing the entity definition within an RDBMS. Different implementations may use different representations for component information for example representations that are not normalized and or not tabular. Different implementations may use various data storage and retrieval frameworks a JSON based database as one example to facilitate storing entity definitions entity definition records . Further within an implementation some information may be implied by for example the position within a defined data structure or schema where a value such as 192. in is stored rather than being stored explicitly. For example in an implementation having a defined data structure for a service definition where the first data item is defined to be the value of the name element for the name component of the service only the value need be explicitly stored as the service component and the element name name are known from the data structure definition.

At block the computing machine causes display of a graphical user interface GUI that enables a user to specify filter criteria for identifying one or more entity definitions. An example GUI that enables a user to specify filter criteria is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine receives user input specifying one or more filter criteria corresponding to a rule. A rule with a single filter criterion can include an element name element value pair where there is a single value. For example the single filter criterion may be name 192.168.1.100 . A rule with multiple filter criteria can include an element name and multiple values. The multiple values can be treated disjunctively. For example the multiple criteria may be name 192.168.1.100 or hope.mbp14.local . In one example an element name in the filter criteria corresponds to an element name of an alias component in at least one entity definition in a data store. In another example an element name in the filter criteria corresponds to an element name of an informational field component in at least one entity definition in the data store.

At block the computing machine receives user input specifying an execution type and execution parameter for each rule. The execution type specifies how the filter criteria should be applied to the entity definitions. The execution type can be static execution or dynamic execution. The execution parameter specifies when the filter criteria should be applied to the entity definitions. User input can be received designating the execution type and execution parameter for a particular rule via a GUI as described below in conjunction with .

Referring to at block the computing machine stores the filter criteria in association with a service definition. The filter criteria can be stored in one or more entity filter criteria components. In one implementation the entity filter criteria components e.g. entity filter criteria components B in are stored in association with a service definition. In another implementation the entity filter criteria components e.g. entity filter criteria components A in are stored within a service definition.

At block the computing machine stores the execution type for each rule in association with the service definition. As described above the execution type for each rule can be stored in a respective entity filter criteria component.

At block the computing machine applies the filter criteria to identify one or more entity definitions satisfying the filter criteria. The filter criteria can be applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store based on the execution type and the execution parameter that has been specified for a rule to which the filter criteria pertains. For example if the execution type is static execution the computing machine can apply the filter criteria a single time. For a static execution type the computing machine can apply the filter criteria a single time when user input which accepts the filter criteria that are specified via the GUI is received. In another example the computing machine can apply the filter criteria a single time the first KPI is being calculated for the service.

If the execution type is dynamic execution the computing machine can apply the filter criteria multiple times. For example for a dynamic execution type the computing machine can apply the filter criteria each time a change to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store is detected. The computing machine can monitor the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store to detect any change that is made to the entity definitions. The change can include for example adding a new entity definition to the service monitoring data store editing an existing entity definition deleting an entity definition etc. In another example the computing machine can apply the filter criteria each time a KPI is calculated for the service.

At block the computing machine associates the identified entity definitions with the service definition. The computing machine stores an association indicator in a stored service definition or a stored entity definition.

A static filter criterion can be executed once or on demand . Static execution of the filter criteria for a particular rule can produce one or more entity associations with the service definition. For example a rule may have the static filter criterion name 192.168.1.100 . The filter criterion name 192.168.1.100 may be applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store once and a search query is performed to identify the entity definition records that satisfy name 192.168.1.100 . The result may be a single entity definition and the single entity definition is associated with the service definition. The association will not the static filter criterion name 192.168.1.100 is applied another time e.g. on demand .

Dynamic filter criterion can be run multiple times automatically i.e. manual vs. automatic. Dynamic execution of the filter criteria for a particular rule can produce a dynamic entity association with the service definition. The filter criteria for the rule can be executed at multiple times and the entity associations may be different from execution to execution. For example a rule may have the dynamic filter criterion name 192. . When the filter criterion name 192. is applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store at time X a search query is performed to identify the entity definitions that satisfy name 192. . The result may be one hundred entity definitions and the one hundred entity definitions are associated with the service definition. One week later a new data center may be added to the IT environment and the filter criterion name 192. may be again applied to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store at time Y. A search query is performed to identify the entity definitions that satisfy name 192. . The result may be four hundred entity definitions and the four hundred entity definitions are associated with the service definition. The filter criterion name 192.168.1.100 can be applied multiple times and the entity definitions that satisfy the filter criterion may differ from time to time.

GUI can include a service definition status bar that displays the various stages for creating a service definition using the GUIs of the service monitoring system. The stages can include for example and are not limited to a service information stage a key performance indicator KPI stage and a service dependencies stage. The status bar can be updated to display an indicator e.g. shaded circle corresponding to a current stage.

GUI can include a save button and a save and next button . For each stage if the save button is activated the settings that have been specified via the GUI for a particular stage e.g. service information stage can be stored in a data store without having to progress to a next stage. For example if user input for the service name description and entity filter criteria has been received and the save button is selected the specified service name description and entity filter criteria can be stored in a service definition record e.g. service definition record in and stored in the service monitoring data store without navigating to a subsequent GUI to specify any KPI or dependencies for the service. If the save and next button is activated the settings that have been specified via the GUI for a particular stage can be stored in a data store and a GUI for the next stage can be displayed. In one implementation user interaction with the save button or the save and next button produces the same save operation that stores service definition information in the service monitoring data store. Unlike the save button save and next button has a further operation of navigating to a subsequent GUI. GUI includes a previous button which when selected displays the previous GUI for creating the service definition.

GUI can facilitate user input specifying a name and optionally a description for the service definition for a service. For example user input of the name TestService and the description Service that contains entities is received.

GUI can include one or more buttons e.g. Yes button No button that can be selected to specify whether entities are associated with the service. A selection of the No button indicates that the service being defined will not be associated with any entities and the resulting service definition has no associations with any entity definitions. For example a service may not be associated with any entities if an end user intends to use the service and corresponding service definition for testing purposes and or experimental purposes. In another example a service may not be associated with any entities if the service is dependent on one or more other services and the service is being monitored via the entities of the one or more other services upon which the service depends upon. For example an end user may wish to use a service without entities as a way to track a business service based on the services which the business service depends upon.

If the Yes button is selected an entity portion enabling a user to specify filter criteria for identifying one or more entity definitions to associate with the service definition is displayed. The filter criteria can correspond to a rule. The entity portion can include a button which when selected displays a button and text box to receive user input specifying an element name and one or more corresponding element values for filter criteria corresponding to a rule as described below in conjunction with .

Referring to the entity portion can include preview information that displays information pertaining to any entity definitions in the service monitoring data store that satisfy the particular filter criteria for the rule. The preview information can be updated as the filter criteria are being specified as described in greater detail below. GUI can include a link which when activated can display a GUI that presents a list of the matching entity definitions as described in greater detail below.

In one implementation the list is populated using the element names that are in the alias components that are in the entity definition records that are stored in the service monitoring data store. In one implementation the list is populated using the element names from the informational field components in the entity definitions. In one implementation the list is populated using field names that are specified by a late binding schema that is applied to events. In one implementation the list is populated using any combination of alias component element names informational field component element names and or field names.

User input can be received that specifies one or more values for the specified element name. For example a user can provide a string for specifying one or more values via text box . In another example a user can select text box and a list of values that correspond to the specified element name can be displayed as described below.

One or more values from the list can be specified for the filter criteria of a rule. For example the filter criteria for rule can include the value 192.168.1.100 and the value hope.mbp14.local . In one implementation when multiple values are part of the filter criteria for a rule the rule treats the values disjunctively. For example when the rule is to be executed the rule triggers a search query to be performed to search for entity definition records that have either an element name name and a corresponding 192.168.1.100 value or have an element name name and a corresponding hope.mbp14.local value.

A service definition can include multiple sets of filter criteria corresponding to different rules. In one implementation the different rules are treated disjunctively as described below.

Rule has multiple filter criteria that include an element name name and multiple element values e.g. the value 192.168.100 and the value hope.mbp14.local . In one implementation the multiple filter criteria are processed disjunctively. For example rule can be processed to search for entity definitions that satisfy name 192.168.1.100 or name hope.mbp14.local . Rule has a single filter criterion that includes element name dest and a single element value 192. for a single filter criterion of dest 192. .

In one example an element value for filter criteria of a rule can be expressed as an exact string e.g. 192.168.1.100 and hope.mbp14.local and the rule can be executed to perform a search query for an exact string match. In another example an element value for filter criteria of a rule can be expressed as a combination of characters and one or more wildcard characters. For example the value 192. for rule contains an asterisk as a wildcard character. A wildcard character in a value can denote that when the rule is executed a wildcard search query is to be performed to identify entity definitions using pattern matching. In another example an element value for a filter criteria rule can be expressed as a regular expression regex as another possible option to identify entity definitions using pattern matching.

In one implementation when multiple sets of filter criteria for different rules are specified for a service definition the multiple rules are processed disjunctively. The entity definitions that satisfy any of the rules are the entity definitions that are to be associated with the service definition. For example any entity definitions that satisfy name 192.168.1.100 or hope.mbp14.local or dest 192. are the entity definitions that are to be associated with the service definition.

GUI can display for each rule being specified a button A B for selecting the execution parameter for the particular rule. GUI can display for each rule being specified a button A B for selecting the execution type e.g. static execution type dynamic execution type for the particular rule. For example rule has a static execution type and rule has a dynamic execution type.

A user may wish to select a static execution type for a rule for example if the user anticipates that one or more entity definitions may not satisfy a rule that has a wildcard based filter criterion. For example a service may already have the rule with filter criterion dest 192. but the user may wish to also associate a particular entity which does not have 192 in its address with the service. A static rule that searches for the particular entity by entity name such as rule with filter criterion name hope.mbp14.local can be added to the service definition.

In another example a user may wish to select a static execution type for a rule for example if the user anticipates that only certain entities will ever be associated with the service. The user may not want any changes to be made inadvertently to the entities that are associated with the service by the dynamic execution of a rule.

GUI can display preview information for the entity definitions that satisfy the filter criteria for the rule s . The preview information can include a number of the entity definitions that satisfy the filter criteria and or the execution type of the rule that pertains to the particular entity definition. For example preview information includes the type static and the number 2 . In one implementation when the execution type is not displayed the preview information represents a dynamic execution type. For example preview information and preview information pertain to rules that have a dynamic execution type.

The preview information can represent execution of a particular rule. For example preview information is for rule . A combination of the preview information can represent execution of all of the rules for the service. For example the combination of preview information and preview information is a summary of the execution of rule and rule .

GUI can include one or more buttons which when selected can re apply the corresponding rule s to update the corresponding preview information. For example the filter criteria for rule may be edited to dest 192.168. and button can be selected to apply the edited filter criteria for rule to the entity definitions in the service monitoring data store. The corresponding preview information and the preview information in the summary may or may not change depending on the search results.

In one implementation the preview information includes a link which when selected can display a list of the entity definitions that are being represented by the preview information. For example preview information for rule indicates that there are 4 entity definitions that satisfy the rule dest 192. . The preview information can include a link which when activated can display a list of the 4 entity definition as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . Referring to GUI can include a link which when selected can display a list of all of the entity definitions that satisfy all of the rules having both static and dynamic execution types such as rule and rule for the service definition.

At block the computing machine receives input e.g. user input of a name for a KPI to monitor a service or an aspect of the service. For example a user may wish to monitor the service s response time for requests and the name of the KPI may be Request Response Time. In another example a user may wish to monitor the load of CPU s for the service and the name of the KPI may be CPU Usage. 

At block the computing machine creates a search query to produce a value indicative of how the service or the aspect of the service is performing. For example the value can indicate how the aspect e.g. CPU usage memory usage request response time is performing at point in time or during a period of time. Some implementations for creating a search query are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . In one implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input via a graphical interface of search processing language defining the search query. Some implementations for creating a search query from input of search processing language are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . In one implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input for defining the search query using a data model. Some implementations for creating a search query using a data model are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine sets one or more thresholds for the KPI. Each threshold defines an end of a range of values. Each range of values represents a state for the KPI. The KPI can be in one of the states e.g. normal state warning state critical state depending on which range the value falls into. Some implementations for setting one or more thresholds for the KPI are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

At block the computing machine receives input e.g. user input specifying a field to use to derive a value indicative of the performance of a service or an aspect of the service to be monitored. As described above machine data can be represented as events. Each of the events is raw data. A late binding schema can be applied to each of the events to extract values for fields defined by the schema. The received input can include the name of the field from which to extract a value when executing the search query. For example the received user input may be the field name spent that can be used to produce a value indicating the time spent to respond to a request.

At block the computing machine optionally receives input specifying a statistical function to calculate a statistic using the value in the field. In one implementation a statistic is calculated using the value s from the field and the calculated statistic is indicative of how the service or the aspect of the service is performing. As discussed above the machine data used by a search query for a KPI to produce a value can be based on a time range. For example the time range can be defined as Last 15 minutes which would represent an aggregation period for producing the value. In other works if the query is executed periodically e.g. every 5 minutes the value resulting from each execution can be based on the last 15 minutes on a rolling basis and the value resulting from each execution can be based on the statistical function. Examples of statistical functions include and are not limited to average count count of distinct values maximum mean minimum sum etc. For example the value may be from the field spent the time range may be Last 15 minutes and the input may specify a statistical function of average to define the search query that should produce the average of the values of field spent for the corresponding 15 minute time range as a statistic. In another example the value may be a count of events satisfying the search criteria that include a constraint for the field e.g. if the field is response time and the KPI is focused on measuring the number of slow responses e.g. response time below x issued by the service .

At block the computing machine defines the search query based on the specified field and the statistical function. The computing machine may also optionally receive input of an alias to use for a result of the search query. The alias can be used to have the result of the search query to be compared to one or more thresholds assigned to the KPI.

In one implementation the search query is defined from input e.g. user input received via a graphical interface of search processing language defining the search query. GUI can include a button for facilitating user input of search processing language defining the search query. If button is selected a GUI for facilitating user input of search processing language defining the search query can be displayed as discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Referring to in another implementation the search query is defined using a data model. GUI can include a button for facilitating user input of a data model for defining the search query. If button is selected a GUI for facilitating user input for defining the search query using a data model can be displayed as discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The input can optionally specify a statistical function e.g. avg that should be used to calculate a statistic based on the value corresponding to a late binding schema being applied to an event. The late binding schema will extract a portion of event data corresponding to the field e.g. spent . For example the value associated with the field spent can be extracted from an event by applying a late binding schema to the event. The input may specify that the average of the values corresponding to the field spent should be produced by the search query. The input can optionally specify an alias e.g. rsp time to use e.g. as a virtual field name for a result of the search query e.g. avg spent . The alias can be used to have the result of the search query to be compared with one or more thresholds assigned to the KPI.

GUI can display a link to facilitate user input to request that the search criteria be tested by running the search query for the KPI. In one implementation when input is received requesting to test the search criteria for the search query a search GUI is displayed.

In some implementations GUI can facilitate user input for creating one or more thresholds for the KPI. The KPI can be in one of multiple states e.g. normal warning critical . Each state can be represented by a range of values. During a certain time the KPI can be in one of the states depending on which range the value which is produced at that time by the search query for the KPI falls into. GUI can include a button for creating the threshold for the KPI. Each threshold for a KPI defines an end of a range of values which represents one of the states. Some implementations for creating one or more thresholds for the KPI are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI can include a button for editing which entity definitions to use for the KPI. Some implementations for editing which entity definitions to use for the KPI are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

In some implementations GUI can include a button to receive input assigning a weight to the KPI to indicate an importance of the KPI for the service relative to other KPIs defined for the service. The weight can be used for calculating an aggregate KPI score for the service to indicate an overall performance for the service as discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . GUI can include a button to receive input to define how often the KPI should be measured e.g. how often the search query defining the KPI should be executed for calculating an aggregate KPI score for the service to indicate an overall performance for the service as discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . The importance e.g. weight of the KPI and the frequency of monitoring e.g. a schedule for executing the search query of the KPI can be used to determine an aggregate KPI score for the service. The score can be a value of an aggregate of the KPIs of the service. Some implementations for using the importance and frequency of monitoring for each KPI to determine an aggregate KPI score for the service are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI can display an input box for a field to which the threshold s can be applied. In particular a threshold can be applied to the value produced by the search query defining the KPI. Applying a threshold to the value produced by the search query is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

If button is selected GUI in is displayed for facilitating user input for selecting a data model to assist with defining the search query. illustrates an example of a GUI of a service monitoring system for facilitating user input for selecting a data model and an object of the data model to use for defining the search query in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. GUI can include a drop down menu which when expanded displays a list of available data models. When a data model is selected GUI can display a list of objects pertaining to the selected data model. For example the data model Performance is selected and the objects pertaining to the Performance data model are included in the list . Objects of a data model are described in greater detail below in conjunction with . When an object in the list is selected GUI can display a list of fields pertaining to the selected object. For example the CPU object is selected and the fields pertaining to the CPU object are included in the list . GUI can facilitate user input of a selection of a field in the list . The selected field e.g. cpu load percent is the field to use for the search query to derive a value indicative of the performance of an aspect e.g. CPU usage of the service. The derived value can be for example the field s value extracted from an event when the search query is executed a statistic calculated based on one or more values of the field in one or more events located when the search query is executed a count of events satisfying the search criteria that include a constraint for the field e.g. if the field is response time and the KPI is focused on measuring the number of slow responses e.g. response time below x issued by the service .

Referring to GUI can display a button for optionally selecting a statistical function to calculate a statistic using the value s from the field e.g. cpu load percent . If a statistic is calculated the result from calculating the statistic becomes the produced value from the search query which indicates how an aspect of the service is performing. When button is selected GUI can display a drop down list of statistics. The list of statistics can include and are not limited to average count count of distinct values maximum mean minimum sum etc. For example a user may select average and the value produced by the search query may be the average of the values of field cpu load percent for a specified time range e.g. Last 15 minutes . illustrates an example of a GUI of a service monitoring system for displaying a selected statistic e.g. average in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure.

Referring to GUI can facilitate user input for creating one or more thresholds for the KPI. GUI can include a button for creating the threshold s for the KPI. Some implementations for creating one or more thresholds for the KPI are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI can include a button for editing which entity definitions to use for the KPI. Some implementations for editing which entity definitions to use for the KPI are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

GUI can include a button for saving a definition of a KPI and an association of the defined KPI with a service. The KPI definition and association with a service can be stored in a data store.

The value for the KPI can be produced by executing the search query of the KPI. In one example the search query defining the KPI can be executed upon receiving a request e.g. user request . For example a service monitoring dashboard which is described in greater detail below in conjunction with can display a KPI widget providing a numerical or graphical representation of the value for the KPI. A user may request the service monitoring dashboard to be displayed and the computing machine can cause the search query for the KPI to execute in response to the request to produce the value for the KPI. The produced value can be displayed in the service monitoring dashboard

In another example the search query defining the KPI can be executed based on a schedule. For example the search query for a KPI can be executed at one or more particular times e.g. 6 00 am 12 00 pm 6 00 pm etc. and or based on a period of time e.g. every 5 minutes . In one example the values produced by a search query for a KPI by executing the search query on a schedule are stored in a data store and are used to calculate an aggregate KPI score for a service as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . An aggregate KPI score for the service is indicative of an overall performance of the KPIs of the service.

Referring to GUI can include a button to receive input specifying a frequency of monitoring schedule for determining the value produced by the search query of the KPI. The frequency of monitoring e.g. schedule of the KPI can be used to determine a resolution for an aggregate KPI score for the service. The aggregate KPI score for the service is indicative of an overall performance of the KPIs of the service. The accuracy of the aggregate KPI score for the service for a given point in time can be based on the frequency of monitoring of the KPI. For example a higher frequency can provide higher resolution which can help produce a more accurate aggregate KPI score.

The machine data used by a search query defining a KPI to produce a value can be based on a time range. The time range can be a user defined time range or a default time range. For example in the service monitoring dashboard example above a user can select via the service monitoring dashboard a time range to use e.g. Last 15 minutes to further specify for example based on time stamps which machine data should be used by a search query defining a KPI. In another example the time range may be to use the machine data since the last time the value was produced by the search query. For example if the KPI is assigned a frequency of monitoring of 5 minutes then the search query can execute every 5 minutes and for each execution use the machine data for the last 5 minutes relative to the execution time. In another implementation the time range is a selected e.g. user selected point in time and the definition of an individual KPI can specify the aggregation period for the respective KPI. By including the aggregation period for an individual KPI as part of the definition of the respective KPI multiple KPIs can run on different aggregation periods which can more accurately represent certain types of aggregations such as distinct counts and sums improving the utility of defined thresholds. In this manner the value of each KPI can be displayed at a given point in time. In one example a user may also select real time as the point in time to produce the most up to date value for each KPI using its respective individually defined aggregation period.

GUI can include a button to receive input assigning a weight to the KPI to indicate an importance of the KPI for the service relative to other KPIs defined for the service. The importance e.g. weight of the KPI can be used to determine an aggregate KPI score for the service which is indicative of an overall performance of the KPIs of the service. Some implementations for using the importance and frequency of monitoring for each KPI to determine an aggregate KPI score for the service are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . illustrates an example of a GUI of a service monitoring system for editing which entity definitions to use for a KPI in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. GUI may be displayed in response to the user activation of button in GUI of . GUI can include a button for creating a new entity definition. If button is selected GUI in can be displayed and an entity definition can be created as described above in conjunction with and .

Referring to GUI can display buttons for receiving a selection of whether to include all of the entity definitions which are associated with the service via the service definition for the KPI. If the Yes button is selected the search query for the KPI can produce a value derived from the machine data pertaining to all of the entities represented by the entity definitions that are included in the service definition for the service. If the No button is selected a member list is displayed. The member list includes the entity definitions that are included in the service definition for the service. GUI can include a filter box to receive input for filtering the member list of entity definitions to display a subset of the entity definitions.

GUI can facilitate user input for selecting one or more entity definitions from the member list and dragging the selected entity definition s to an exclusion list to indicate that the entities identified in each selected entity definition should not be considered for the current KPI. This exclusion means that the search criteria of the search query defining the KPI is changed to no longer search for machine data pertaining to the entities identified in the entity definitions from the exclusion list . For example entity definition e.g. webserver07.splunk.com can be selected and dragged to the exclusion list . When the search query for the KPI produces a value the value will be derived from machine data which does not include machine data pertaining to webserver07.splunk.com.

At block the computing machine identifies a service definition for a service. In one implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input selecting a service definition. The computing machine accesses the service definition for a service from memory.

At block the computing machine identifies a KPI for the service. In one implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input selecting a KPI of the service. The computing machine accesses data representing the KPI from memory.

At block the computing machine causes display of one or more graphical interfaces enabling a user to set a threshold for the KPI. The KPI can be in one of multiple states. Example states can include and are not limited to unknown trivial state informational state normal state warning state error state and critical state. Each state can be represented by a range of values. At a certain time the KPI can be in one of the states depending on which range the value which is produced by the search query for the KPI falls into. Each threshold defines an end of a range of values which represents one of the states. Some examples of graphical interfaces for enabling a user to set a threshold for the KPI are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with to .

At block the computing machine receives through the graphical interfaces an indication of how to set the threshold for the KPI. The computing machine can receive input e.g. user input via the graphical interfaces specifying the field or alias that should be used for the threshold s for the KPI. The computing machine can also receive input e.g. user input via the graphical interfaces of the parameters for each state. The parameters for each state can include for example and not limited to a threshold that defines an end of a range of values for the state a unique name and one or more visual indicators to represent the state.

In one implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input via the graphical interfaces to set a threshold and to apply the threshold to the KPI as determined using the machine data from the aggregate of the entities associated with the KPI.

In another implementation the computing machine receives input e.g. user input via the graphical interfaces to set a threshold and to apply the threshold to a KPI as the KPI is determine using machine data on a per entity basis for the entities associated with the KPI. For example the computing machine can receive a selection e.g. user selection to apply thresholds on a per entity basis and the computing machine can apply the thresholds to the value of the KPI as the value is calculated per entity.

For example the computing machine may receive input e.g. user input via the graphical interfaces to set a threshold of being equal or greater than 80 for the KPI for Avg CPU Load and the KPI is associated with three entities e.g. Entity 1 Entity 2 and Entity 3 . When the KPI is determined using data for Entity 1 the value for the KPI for Avg CPU Load may be at 50 . When the KPI is determined using data for Entity 2 the value for the KPI for Avg CPU Load may be at 50 . When the KPI is determined using data for Entity 3 the value for the KPI for Avg CPU Load may be at 80 . If the threshold is applied to the values of the aggregate of the entities two at 50 and one at 80 the aggregate value of the entities is 60 and the KPI would not exceed the 80 threshold. If the threshold is applied using an entity basis for the thresholds applied to the individual KPI values as calculated pertaining to each entity the computing machine can determine that the KPI pertaining to one of the entities e.g. Entity 3 satisfies the threshold by being equal to 80 .

At block the computing machine determines whether to set another threshold for the KPI. The computing machine can receive input via the graphical interface indicating there is another threshold to set for the KPI. If there is another threshold to set for the KPI the computing machine returns to block to set the other threshold.

If there is not another threshold to set for the KPI block the computing machine determines whether to set a threshold for another KPI for the service at block . The computing machine can receive input via the graphical interface indicating there is a threshold to set for another KPI for the service. In one implementation there are a maximum number of thresholds that can be set for a KPI. In one implementation a same number of states are to be set for the KPIs of a service. In one implementation a same number of states are to be set for the KPIs of all services. The service monitoring system can be coupled to a data store that stores configuration data that specifies whether there is a maximum number of thresholds for a KPI and the value for the maximum number whether a same number of states is to be set for the KPIs of a service and the value for the number of states and whether a same number of states is to be set for the KPIs of all of the service and the value for the number of states. If there is a threshold to set for another KPI the computing machine returns to block to identity the other KPI.

At block the computing machine stores the one or more threshold settings for the one or more KPIs for the service. The computing machine associates the parameters for a state defined by a corresponding threshold in a data store that is coupled to the computing machine.

As will be discussed in more detail below implementations of the present disclosure provide a service monitoring dashboard that includes KPI widgets widgets to visually represent KPIs of the service. A widget can be a Noel gauge a spark line a single value or a trend indicator. A Noel gauge is indicator of measurement as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . A widget of a KPI can present one or more values indicating how a respective service or an aspect of a service is performing at one or more points in time. The widget can also illustrate e.g. using visual indicators such as color shading shape pattern trend compared to a different time range etc. the KPI s current state defined by one or more thresholds of the KPI.

GUI in can include a statistical function to be used for producing a value when executing the search query of the KPI. As shown the statistical function is a count and the resulting statistic the count value should be compared with one or more thresholds of the KPI. The GUI also includes a button for creating the threshold s for the KPI. When either button is selected from GUI or button is selected from GUI GUI of is displayed.

The search of is represented by search processing language for defining a search query that produces a value derived from machine data pertaining to the entities that provide the service and which are identified in the service definition. The value can indicate a current state of the KPI e.g. normal warning critical . An entity identifier of specifies one or more fields e.g. dest ip address that can be used to identify one or more entities whose machine data should be used in the search of . The threshold field GUI element enables specification of one or more fields from the entities machine data that should be used to derive a value produced by the search of . One or more thresholds can be applied to the value associated with the specified field s of . In particular the value can be produced by a search query using the search of and can be for example the value of threshold field associated with an event satisfying search criteria of the search query when the search query is executed a statistic calculated based on values for the specified threshold field of associated with the one or more events satisfying the search criteria of the search query when the search query is executed or a count of events satisfying the search criteria of the search query that include a constraint for the threshold field of etc. In the example illustrated in GUI the designated threshold field of is cpu load percent which may represent the percentage of the maximum processor load currently being utilized on a particular machine. In other examples the threshold s may be applied a field specified in which may represent other metrics such as total memory usage remaining storage capacity server response time or network traffic for example.

In one implementation the search query includes a machine data selection component and a determination component. The machine data selection component is used to arrive at a set of machine data from which to calculate a KPI. The determination component is used to derive a representative value for an aggregate of the set of machine data. In one implementation the machine data selection component is applied once to the machine data to gather the totality of the machine data for the KPI and returns the machine data sorted by entity to allow for repeated application of the determination component to the machine data pertaining to each entity on an individual basis. In one implementation portions of the machine data selection component and the determination component may be intermixed within search language of the search query the search language depicted in as an example of search language of a search query .

KPI monitoring parameters refer to parameters that indicate how to monitor the state of the KPI defined by the search of . In one embodiment KPI monitoring parameters include the importance indicator of the calculation frequency indicator of and the calculation period indicator of element .

GUI element may include a drop down menu with various interval options for the calculation frequency indicator. The interval options indicate how often the KPI search should run to calculate the KPI value. These options may include for example every minute every 15 minutes every hour every 5 hours every day every week etc. Each time the chosen interval is reached the KPI is recalculated and the KPI value is populated into a summary index allowing the system to maintain a record indicating the state of the KPI over time.

GUI element may include individual GUI elements for multiple calculation parameters such as drop down menus for various statistic options periods of time options and bucketing options . The statistic options drop down indicates a selected one i.e. Average of the available methods in the drop down not shown that can be applied to the value s associated with the threshold field of . The expanded drop down may display available methods such as average maximum minimum median etc. The periods of time options drop down indicates a selected one i.e. Last Hour of the available options not shown . The selected period of time option is used to identify events by executing the search query associated with a specific time range i.e. the period of time and each available option represents the period over which the KPI value is calculated such as the last minute last 15 minutes last hour last 4 hours last day last week etc. Each time the KPI is recalculated e.g. at the interval specified using the values are determined according to the statistic option specified using over the period of time specified using . The bucketing options of drop down each indicate a period of time from which the calculated values should be grouped together for purposes of determining the state of the KPI. The bucketing options may include by minute by 15 minutes by hour by four hours by day by week etc. For example when looking at data over the last hour and when a bucketing option of 15 minutes is selected the calculated values may be grouped every 15 minutes and if the calculated values e.g. the maximum or average for the 15 minute bucket cross a threshold into a particular state the state of the KPI for the whole hour may be set to that particular state.

Importance indicator of may include a drop down menu with various weighting options. As discussed in more detail with respect to the weighting options indicate the importance of the associated KPI value to the overall health of the service. These weighting options may include for example values from 1 to 10 where the higher values indicate higher importance of the KPI relative to the other KPIs for the service. When determining the overall health of the service the weighting values of each KPI may be used as a multiplier to normalize the KPIs so that the values of KPIs having different weights may be combined together. In one implementation a weighting option of may be available as an overriding weight. The overriding weight is a weight that overrides the weights of all other KPIs of the service. For example if the state of the KPI which has the overriding weight is warning but all other KPIs of the service have a normal state then the service may only be considered in a warning state and the normal state s for the other KPIs can be disregarded.

Referring to if button is selected three times there will be three thresholds for the KPI. Each threshold defines an end of a range of values which represents one of the states. GUI can display a UI element e.g. column that includes sections representing the defined states for the KPI as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . GUI can facilitate user input to specify a maximum value and a minimum value for defining a scale for a widget that can be used to represent the KPI on the service monitoring dashboard. Some implementations of widgets for representing KPIs are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with and .

Referring to GUI can optionally include a button for receiving input indicating whether to apply the threshold s to the aggregate of the KPIs of the service or to the particular KPI. Some implementations for applying the threshold s to the aggregate of the KPIs of the service or to a particular KPI are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Each state of the KPI can have a name and can be represented by a range of values and a visual indicator. The range of values is defined by one or more thresholds that can provide the minimum end and or the maximum end of the range of values for the state. The characteristics of the state e.g. the name the range of values and a visual indicator can be edited via input fields of the respective GUI element.

In the example shown in GUI includes three GUI elements representing three different states of the KPI based on three added thresholds. These states include states and .

For each state GUI can include a GUI element that displays a name e.g. a unique name for that KPI a threshold and a visual indicator e.g. an icon having a distinct color for each state . The unique name a threshold and a visual indicator can be displayed based on user input received via the input fields of the respective GUI element. For example the name Normal can be specified for state the name Warning can be specified for state the name Critical can be specified for state .

The visual indicator can be for example an icon having a distinct visual characteristic such as a color a pattern a shade a shape or any combination of color pattern shade and shape as well as any other visual characteristics. For each state the GUI element can display a drop down menu which when selected displays a list of available visual characteristics. A user selection of a specific visual characteristic e.g. a distinct color can be received for each state.

For each state input of a threshold value representing the minimum end of the range of values for the corresponding state of the KPI can be received via the threshold portion of the GUI element. The maximum end of the range of values for the corresponding state can be either a preset value or can be defined by or based on the threshold associated with the succeeding state of the KPI where the threshold associated with the succeeding state is higher than the threshold associated with the state before it.

For example for Normal state the threshold value 0 may be received to represent the minimum end of the range of KPI values for that state. The maximum end of the range of KPI values for the Normal state can be defined based on the threshold associated with the succeeding state e.g. Warning state of the KPI. For example the threshold value 50 may be received for the Warning state of the KPI. Accordingly the maximum end of the range of KPI values for the Normal state can be set to a number immediately preceding the threshold value of 50 e.g. it can be set to 49 if the values used to indicate the KPI state are integers .

The maximum end of the range of KPI values for the Warning state is defined based on the threshold associated with the succeeding state e.g. Critical state of the KPI. For example the threshold value 75 may be received for the Critical state of the KPI which may cause the maximum end of the range of values for the Warning state to be set to 74. The maximum end of the range of values for the highest state e.g. Critical state can be a preset value or an indefinite value.

When input is received for a threshold value for a corresponding state of the KPI and or a visual characteristic for an icon of the corresponding state of the KPI GUI reflects this input by dynamically modifying a visual appearance of a vertical UI element e.g. column that includes sections that represent the defined states for the KPI. Specifically the sizes e.g. heights of the sections can be adjusted to visually illustrate ranges of KPI values for the states of the KPI and the threshold values can be visually represented as marks on the column . In addition the appearance of each section is modified based on the visual characteristic e.g. color pattern selected by the user for each state via a drop down menu . In some implementations once the visual characteristic is selected for a specific state it is also illustrated by modified appearance e.g. modified color or pattern of icon positioned next to a threshold value associated with that state.

For example if the color green is selected for the Normal state a respective section of column can be displayed with the color green to represent the Normal state . In another example if the value 50 is received as input for the minimum end of a range of values for the Warning state a mark is placed on column to represent the value 50 in proportion to other marks and the overall height of the column . As discussed above the size e.g. height of each section of the UI element e.g. column is defined by the minimum end and the maximum end of the range of KPI values of the corresponding state.

In one implementation GUI displays one or more pre defined states for the KPI. Each predefined state is associated with at least one of a pre defined unique name a pre defined value representing a minimum end of a range of values or a predefined visual indicator. Each pre defined state can be represented in GUI with corresponding GUI elements as described above.

GUI can facilitate user input to specify a maximum value and a minimum value for the combination of the KPI states to define a scale for a widget that represents the KPI. Some implementations of widgets for representing KPIs are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with and . GUI can display a button for receiving input indicating whether to apply the threshold s to the aggregate KPI of the service or to the particular KPI or both. The application of threshold s to the aggregate KPI of the service or to a particular KPI is discussed in more detail below in conjunction with .

In GUI of the user has adjusted the position of mark thereby decreasing the end of the range of values for the Critical state to 10 GB. Horizontal line is also lowered to reflect the change. In one implementation the user may click and drag mark down to the desired value. In another implementation the user may type in the desired value. The user can tell that the KPI values now drop below the end of the only once thereby limiting the number of alerts associated with the defined threshold.

In GUI of different threshold types are presented. Threshold types include an aggregate threshold type a per entity threshold type and a combined threshold type. An aggregate threshold type represents thresholds applied to a KPI which represents contributions of all KPI entities in the service. With an aggregate threshold type a current KPI state can be determined by applying the determination component of the search query to an aggregate of machine data pertaining to all individual KPI entities to produce a KPI value and applying at least one aggregate threshold to the KPI value.

A per entity threshold type represents thresholds applied separately to KPI contributions of individual KPI entities of the service. With a per entity threshold type a current KPI state can be determined by applying the determination component to an aggregate of machine data pertaining to an individual KPI entity to determine a KPI contribution of the individual KPI entity comparing at least one per entity threshold with a KPI contribution separately for each individual KPI entity and selecting the KPI state based on a threshold comparison with a KPI contribution of a single entity. In other words a contribution of an individual KPI entity can define the current state of the KPI of the service. For example if the KPI of the service is below a critical threshold corresponding to the start of a critical state but a contribution of one of the KPI entities is above the critical threshold the state of the KPI can be determined as critical.

A combined threshold type represents discrete thresholds applied separately to the KPI values for the service and to the KPI contributions of individual entities in the service. With a combined threshold type a current KPI state can be determined twice first by comparing at least one aggregate threshold with the KPI of the service and second by comparing at least one per entity threshold with a KPI contribution separately for each individual KPI entity.

In the example of the aggregate threshold type has been selected using a respective GUI element e.g. one of buttons and thresholds have been provided to define different states for the KPI of the service. In response to the selection of the aggregate threshold type GUI presents an interface component including line chart that visualizes predefined KPI states and how a current state of the KPI changes over a period of time selected from the monitoring GUI . In one implementation the interface component includes a horizontal axis representing the selected period of time e.g. last 60 minutes and a vertical axis representing the range of possible KPI values. The various states of the KPI are represented by horizontal bands such as displayed along the horizontal length of the interface component. In one implementation when a mark is added to column indicating the start or end of a range of values for a particular state a corresponding horizontal band is also displayed. The marks in column can be dragged up and down to vary the KPI thresholds and correspondingly the ranges of values that correspond to each different state. Line chart represents KPI values for the current KPI over a period of time selected from the monitoring GUI and determined by the determination component of the search query as described above. The KPI values are plotted over the period of time on a horizontal axis and against a range of values set by the maximum value and minimum value on a vertical axis. The horizontal bands make it easy to visually correlate the KPI values represented by line chart with the start and end of the range of values of a particular state. For example in with the Critical state having a range above 69.34 the horizontal band indicates that the KPI value exceeds the start of the range one time. Since line chart represents the KPI of the service the values plotted by line chart may include the average of the average cpu load percent of all KPI entities in the service calculated over the selected period of time. Accordingly the state of the KPI may only change when the aggregate contribution of all KPI entities crosses the threshold from one band to another .

In GUI of adjacent to column an interface component with two line charts and is displayed. In this implementation the per entity threshold type has been selected using a respective GUI element e.g. one of buttons . Accordingly the line charts and represent the KPI contributions of individual entities in the service over the period of time selected from the monitoring GUI . The per entity contributions are plotted over the period of time on a first horizontal axis and against a range of values set by the maximum value and minimum value on a second vertical axis. Since line charts and represent per entity KPI contributions the values plotted by line chart may include the average cpu load percent of a first entity over the selected period of time while the values plotted by line chart may include the average cpu load percent of a second entity over the same period of time. In one implementation the determination component of the search query determines a contribution of an individual KPI entity from an aggregate of machine data corresponding to the individual KPI entity applies at least one entity threshold to the contribution of the individual KPI entity and selects a KPI state based at least in part on the determined contribution of the individual KPI entity in view of the applied threshold. Accordingly the state of the KPI may change when any of the per entity contributions cross the threshold from one band to another .

In GUI of the combined threshold type has been selected using a respective GUI element e.g. one of buttons . Accordingly GUI includes two separate interface components with one line chart on a first set of axes that represents the KPI of the service in the first interface component and two additional line charts and on a second set of axes that represent the per entity KPI contributions in the second interface component. Both sets of axes represent the same period of time on the horizontal axes however the range of values on the vertical axes may differ. Similarly separate thresholds may be applied to the service KPI represented by line chart and to the per entity KPI contributions represented by line charts and . Since line chart represents the service KPI the values plotted by line chart may include the average of the average cpu load percent of all entities in the service calculated over the selected period of time. Accordingly the state of the KPI may only change when the aggregate value crosses the thresholds that separate any of bands or . Since line charts and represent per entity contributions for the KPI the values plotted by line chart may include the average cpu load percent of a first entity over the selected period of time while the values plotted by line chart may include the average cpu load percent of a second entity over the same period of time. Accordingly the state of the KPI may change when any of the per entity values cross the thresholds that separate any of bands or . In cases where the aggregate thresholds and per entity thresholds result in different states for the KPI in one implementation the more severe state may take precedence and be set as the state of the KPI. For example if the aggregate threshold indicates a state of Medium but one of the per entity thresholds indicates a state of High the more severe High state may be used as the overall state of the KPI.

In one implementation a visual indicator also referred to herein as a lane inspector may be present in any of the GUIs . The lane inspector includes for example a line or other indicator that spans vertically across the bands at a given point in time along the horizontal time axis. The lane inspector may be user manipulable such that it may be moved along the time axis to different points. In one implementation the lane inspector includes a display of the point in time at which it is currently located. In one implementation the lane inspector further includes a display of a KPI value reflected in each of the line charts at the current point in time illustrated by the lane inspector. Additional details of the lane inspector are described below but are equally applicable to this implementation.

At block the computing machine causes display of a GUI that presents information specifying a service definition for a service and a specification for determining a KPI for the service. In one implementation the service definition identifies a service provided by a plurality of entities each having corresponding machine data. The specification for determining the KPI refers to the KPI definitional information e.g. which entities which records fields from machine data what time frame etc. that is being defined and is stored as part of the service definition or in association with the service definition. In one implementation the KPI is defined by a search query that produces a value derived from the machine data pertaining to one or more KPI entities selected from among the plurality of entities. The KPI entities may include a set of entities of the service i.e. service entities whose relevant machine data is used in the calculation of the KPI. Thus the KPI entities may include either whole set or a subset of the service entities. The value produced by the search query may be indicative of a performance assessment for the service at a point in time or during a period of time. In one implementation the search query includes a machine data selection component that is used to arrive at a set of data from which to calculate a KPI and a determination component to derive a representative value for an aggregate of machine data. The determination component is applied to the identified set of data to produce a value on a per entity basis a KPI contribution of an individual entity . In one alternative the machine data selection component is applied once to the machine data to gather the totality of the machine data for the KPI and returns the machine data sorted by entity to allow for repeated application of the determination component to the machine data pertaining to each entity on an individual basis.

At block the computing machine receives user input specifying one or more entity thresholds for each of the KPI entities. The entity thresholds each represent an end of a range of values corresponding to a particular KPI state from among a set of KPI states as described above.

At block the computing machine stores the entity thresholds in association with the specification for determining the KPI for the service. In one implementation the entity thresholds are added to the service definition.

At block the computing machine makes the stored entity thresholds available for determining a state of the KPI. In one implementation determining the state of the KPI includes determining a contribution of an individual KPI entity by applying the determination component to an aggregate of machine data corresponding to the individual KPI entity and then applying at least one entity threshold to a KPI contribution of the individual KPI entity. Further the computing machine selects a KPI state based at least in part on the determined contribution of the individual KPI entity in view of the applied entity threshold. In one implementation the entity thresholds are made available by exposing them through an API. In one implementation the entity thresholds are made available by storing information for referencing them in an index of definitional components. In one implementation the entity thresholds are made available as an integral part of storing them in a particular logical or physical location such as logically storing them as part of a KPI definitional information collection associated with a particular service definition. In such an implementation a single action or process then may accomplish both the storing of the entity thresholds and the making available of the entity thresholds.

At block the computing machine identifies a service to evaluate. The service is provided by one or more entities. The computing system can receive user input via one or more graphical interfaces selecting a service to evaluate. The service can be represented by a service definition that associates the service with the entities as discussed in more detail above.

At block the computing machine identifies key performance indicators KPIs for the service. The service definition representing the service can specify KPIs available for the service and the computing machine can determine the KPIs for the service from the service definition of the service. Each KPI can pertain to a different aspect of the service. Each KPI can be defined by a search query that derives a value for that KPI from machine data pertaining to entities providing the service. As discussed above the entities providing the service are identified in the service definition of the service. According to a search query a KPI value can be derived from machine data of all or some entities providing the service.

In some implementations not all of the KPIs for a service are used to calculate the aggregate KPI score for the service. For example a KPI may solely be used for troubleshooting and or experimental purposes and may not necessarily contribute to providing the service or impacting the performance of the service. The troubleshooting experimental KPI can be excluded from the calculation of the aggregate KPI score for the service.

In one implementation the computing machine uses a frequency of monitoring that is assigned to a KPI to determine whether to include a KPI in the calculation of the aggregate KPI score. The frequency of monitoring is a schedule for executing the search query that defines a respective KPI. As discussed above the individual KPIs can represent saved searches. These saved searches can be scheduled for execution based on the frequency of monitoring of the respective KPIs. In one example the frequency of monitoring specifies a time period e.g. 1 second 2 minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes etc. for executing the search query that defines a respective KPI which then produces a value for the respective KPI with each execution of the search query. In another example the frequency of monitoring specifies particular times e.g. 6 00 am 12 00 pm 6 00 pm etc. for executing the search query. The values produced for the KPIs of the service based on the frequency of monitoring for the KPIs can be considered when calculating a score for an aggregate KPI of the service as discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Alternatively the frequency of monitoring can specify that the KPI is not to be measured that the search query for a KPI is not to be executed . For example a troubleshooting KPI may be assigned a frequency of monitoring of zero.

In one implementation if a frequency of monitoring is unassigned for a KPI the KPI is automatically excluded in the calculation for the aggregate KPI score. In one implementation if a frequency of monitoring is unassigned for a KPI the KPI is automatically included in the calculation for the aggregate KPI score.

The frequency of monitoring can be assigned to a KPI automatically without any user input based on default settings or based on specific characteristics of the KPI such as a service aspect associated with the KPI a statistical function used to derive a KPI value e.g. maximum versus average etc. For example different aspects of the service can be associated with different frequencies of monitoring and KPIs can inherit frequencies of monitoring of corresponding aspects of the service.

Values for KPIs can be derived from machine data that is produced by different sources. The sources may produce the machine data at various frequencies e.g. every minute every 10 minutes every 30 minutes etc. and or the machine data may be collected at various frequencies e.g. every minute every 10 minutes every 30 minutes etc. . In another example the frequency of monitoring can be assigned to a KPI automatically without any user input based on the accessibility of machine data associated with the KPI associated through entities providing the service . For example an entity may be associated with machine data that is generated at a medium frequency e.g. every 10 minutes and the KPI for which a value is being produced using this particular machine data can be automatically assigned a medium frequency for its frequency of monitoring.

Alternatively frequency of monitoring can be assigned to KPIs based on user input. illustrates an example GUI for creating and or editing a KPI including assigning a frequency of monitoring to a KPI based on user input in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. GUI for can include a button to receive a user request to assign a frequency of monitoring to the KPI being created or modified. Upon activating button a user can enter e.g. via another GUI or a command line interface a frequency e.g. a user defined value for the KPI or select a frequency from a list presented to the user. In one example the list may include various frequency types where each frequency type is mapped to a pre defined and or user defined time period. For example the frequency types may include Real Time e.g. 1 second High Frequency e.g. 2 minutes Medium Frequency e.g. 10 minutes Low Frequency e.g. 30 minutes Do Not Measure e.g. no frequency .

The assigned frequency of monitoring of KPIs can be included in the service definition specifying the KPIs or in a separate data structure together with other settings of a KPI.

Referring to at block the computing machine derives one or more values for each of the identified KPIs. The computing machine can cause the search query for each KPI to execute to produce a corresponding value. In one implementation as discussed above the search query for a particular KPI is executed based on a frequency of monitoring assigned to the particular KPI. When the frequency of monitoring for a KPI is set to a time period for example High Frequency e.g. 2 minutes a value for the KPI is derived each time the search query defining the KPI is executed every 2 minutes. The derived value s for each KPI can be stored in an index. In one implementation when a KPI is assigned a frequency of monitoring of Do Not Measure or is assigned a zero frequency no frequency no value is produced the search query for the KPI is not executed for the respective KPI and no values for the respective KPI are stored in the data store.

At block the computing machine calculates a value for an aggregate KPI score for the service using the value s from each of the KPIs of the service. The value for the aggregate KPI score indicates an overall performance of the service. For example a Web Hosting service may have 10 KPIs and one of the 10 KPIs may have a frequency of monitoring set to Do Not Monitor. The other nine KPIs may be assigned various frequencies of monitoring. The computing machine can access the values produced for the nine KPIs in the data store to calculate the value for the aggregate KPI score for the service as discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . Based on the values obtained from the data store if the values produced by the search queries for 8 of the 9 KPIs indicate that the corresponding KPI is in a normal state then the value for an aggregate KPI score may indicate that the overall performance of the service is normal.

An aggregate KPI score can be calculated by adding the values of all KPIs of the same service together. Alternatively an importance of each individual KPI relative to other KPIs of the service is considered when calculating the aggregate KPI score for the service. For example a KPI can be considered more important than other KPIs of the service if it has a higher importance weight than the other KPIs of the service.

In some implementations importance weights can be assigned to KPIs automatically without any user input based on characteristics of individual KPIs. For example different aspects of the service can be associated with different weights and KPIs can inherit weights of corresponding aspects of the service. In another example a KPI deriving its value from machine data pertaining to a single entity can be automatically assigned a lower weight than a KPI deriving its value from machine data pertaining to multiple entities etc.

Alternatively importance weights can be assigned to KPIs based on user input. Referring again to GUI can include a button to receive a user request to assign a weight to the KPI being created or modified. Upon selecting button a user can enter e.g. via another GUI or a command line interface a weight e.g. a user defined value for the KPI or select a weight from a list presented to the user. In one implementation a greater value indicates that a greater importance is placed on a KPI. For example the set of values may be 1 10 where the value 10 indicates high importance of the KPI relative to the other KPIs for the service. For example a Web Hosting service may have three KPIs 1 CPU Usage 2 Memory Usage and 3 Request Response Time. A user may provide input indicating that the Request Response Time KPI is the most important KPI and may assign a weight of 10 to the Request Response Time KPI. The user may provide input indicating that the CPU Usage KPI is the next most important KPI and may assign a weight of 5 to the CPU Usage KPI. The user may provide input indicating that the Memory Usage KPI is the least important KPI and may assign a weight of 1 to the Memory Usage KPI.

In one implementation a KPI is assigned an overriding weight. The overriding weight is a weight that overrides the importance weights of the other KPIs of the service. Input e.g. user input can be received for assigning an overriding weight to a KPI. The overriding weight indicates that the status state of KPI should be used a minimum overall state of the service. For example if the state of the KPI which has the overriding weight is warning and one or more other KPIs of the service have a normal state then the service may only be considered in either a warning or critical state and the normal state s for the other KPIs can be disregarded.

In another example a user can provide input that ranks the KPIs of a service from least important to most important and the ranking of a KPI specifies the user selected weight for the respective KPI. For example a user may assign a weight of 1 to the Memory Usage KPI assign a weight of 2 to the CPU Usage KPI and assign a weight of 3 to the Request Response Time KPI. The assigned weight of each KPI may be included in the service definition specifying the KPIs or in a separate data structure together with other settings of a KPI.

Alternatively or in addition a KPI can be considered more important than other KPIs of the service if it is measured more frequently than the other KPIs of the service. In other words search queries of different KPIs of the service can be executed with different frequency as specified by a respective frequency of monitoring and queries of more important KPIs can be executed more frequently than queries of less important KPIs.

As will be discussed in more detail below in conjunction with the calculation of a score for an aggregate KPI may be based on ratings assigned to different states of an individual KPI. Referring again to a user can select button for defining threshold settings including state ratings for a KPI to display GUI in . illustrates an example GUI for defining threshold settings including state ratings for a KPI in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. Similarly to GUI of GUI includes horizontal GUI elements e.g. in the form of input boxes and that represent specific states of the KPI. For each state a corresponding GUI element can display a name a threshold and a visual indicator e.g. an icon having a distinct color for each state . The name a threshold and a visual indicator can be displayed based on user input received via the input fields of the respective GUI element. GUI can include a vertical GUI element e.g. a column that changes appearance e.g. the size and color of its sectors based on input received for a threshold value for a corresponding state of the KPI and or a visual characteristic for an icon of the corresponding state of the KPI. In some implementations once the visual characteristic is selected for a specific state via the menu it is also illustrated by the modified appearance e.g. modified color or pattern of icon positioned next to a threshold value associated with that state.

In addition GUI provides for configuring a rating for each state of the KPI. The ratings indicate which KPIs should be given more or less consideration in view of their current states. When calculating an aggregate KPI a score of each individual KPI reflects the rating of that KPI s current state as will be discussed in more detail below in conjunction with . Ratings for different KPI states can be assigned automatically e.g. based on a range of KPI values for a state or specified by a user. GUI can include a field that displays an automatically generated rating or a rating entered or selected by a user. Field may be located next to or in the same row as a horizontal GUI element representing a corresponding state. Alternatively field can be part of the horizontal GUI element. In one example a user may provide input assigning a rating of 1 to the Normal State a rating of 2 to the Warning State and a rating of 3 to the Critical State.

In one implementation GUI displays a button for receiving input indicating whether to apply the threshold s to the aggregate KPI of the service or to the particular KPI or both. If a threshold is configured to be applied to a certain individual KPI then a specified action e.g. generate alert add to report will be triggered when a value of that KPI reaches or exceeds the individual KPI threshold. If a threshold is configured to be applied to the aggregate KPI of the service then a specified action e.g. create notable event generate alert add to incident report will be triggered when a value e.g. a score of the aggregate KPI reaches or exceeds the aggregate KPI threshold. In some implementations a threshold can be applied to both or either the individual or aggregate KPI and different actions or the same action can be triggered depending on the KPI to which the threshold is applied. The actions to be triggered can be pre defined or specified by the user via a user interface e.g. a GUI or a command line interface while the user is defining thresholds or after the thresholds have been defined. The action to be triggered in view of thresholds can be included in the service definition identifying the respective KPI s or can be stored in a data structure dedicated to store various KPI settings of a relevant KPI.

At block the computing machine identifies a service to be evaluated. The service is provided by one or more entities. The computing system can receive user input via one or more graphical interfaces selecting a service to evaluate.

At block the computing machine identifies key performance indicators KPIs for the service. The computing machine can determine the KPIs for the service from the service definition of the service. Each KPI indicates how a specific aspect of the service is performing at a point in time.

As discussed above in some implementations a KPI pertaining to a specific aspect of the service also referred to herein as an aspect KPI can be defined by a search query that derives a value for that KPI from machine data pertaining to entities providing the service. Alternatively an aspect KPI may be a sub service aggregate KPI. Such a KPI is sub service in the sense that it characterizes something less than the service as a whole. Such a KPI is an aspect KPI in the almost definitional sense that something less than the service as a whole is an aspect of the service. Such a KPI is an aggregate KPI in the sense that the search which defines it produces its value using a selection of accumulated KPI values in the data store or of contemporaneously produced KPI values or a combination rather than producing its value using a selection of event data directly. The selection of accumulated KPI values for such a sub service aggregate KPI includes values for as few as two different KPI s defined for a service which stands in varying degrees of contrast to a selection including values for all or substantially all of the active KPI s defined for service as is the case with a service level KPI. A KPI is an active KPI when its definitional search query is enabled to execute on a scheduled basis in the service monitoring system. See the related discussion in regards to . Unless otherwise indicated discussion herein related to KPI s associated with a service or the like may presume the reference is to active KPI definitions particularly where the context relates to available KPI values such that the notion of all may reasonably be understood to represent something corresponding to technically less than all of the relevant extant KPI definitions. A method for determining e.g. by calculating a service level aggregate KPI is discussed in relation to the flow diagram of . A person of ordinary skill in the art now will understand how the teachings surrounding may be adapted to determine or produce an aggregate KPI that is a sub service aggregate KPI. Similarly a person of skill in the art now will understand how teachings herein regarding GUIs for creating establishing modifying viewing or otherwise processing KPI definitions such as GUIs discussed in relation to may be adapted to accommodate a KPI having a defining search query that produces its value using a selection of accumulated KPI values in the data store or of contemporaneously produced KPI values or a combination rather than producing its value using a selection of event data directly.

At block the computing machine optionally identifies a weighting e.g. user selected weighting or automatically assigned weighting for each of the KPIs of the service. As discussed above the weighting of each KPI can be determined from the service definition of the service or a KPI definition storing various setting of the KPI.

At block the computing machine derives one or more values for each KPI for the service by executing a search query associated with the KPI. As discussed above each KPI is defined by a search query that derives the value for a corresponding KPI from the machine data that is associated with the one or more entities that provide the service.

As discussed above the machine data associated with the one or more entities that provide the same service is identified using a user created service definition that identifies the one or more entities that provide the service. The user created service definition also identifies for each entity identifying information for locating the machine data pertaining to that entity. In another example the user created service definition also identifies for each entity identifying information for a user created entity definition that indicates how to locate the machine data pertaining to that entity. The machine data can include for example and is not limited to unstructured data log data and wire data. The machine data associated with an entity can be produced by that entity. In addition or alternatively the machine data associated with an entity can include data about the entity which can be collected through an API for software that monitors that entity.

The computing machine can cause the search query for each KPI to execute to produce a corresponding value for a respective KPI. The search query defining a KPI can derive the value for that KPI in part by applying a late binding schema to machine data or more specifically to events containing raw portions of the machine data. The search query can derive the value for the KPI by using a late binding schema to extract an initial value and then performing a calculation on e.g. applying a statistical function to the initial value.

The values of each of the KPIs can differ at different points in time. As discussed above the search query for a KPI can be executed based on a frequency of monitoring assigned to the particular KPI. When the frequency of monitoring for a KPI is set to a time period for example Medium Frequency e.g. 10 minutes a value for the KPI is derived each time the search query defining the KPI is executed every 10 minutes. The derived value s for each KPI can be stored in a data store. When a KPI is assigned a zero frequency no frequency no value is produced the search query for the KPI is not executed for the respective KPI.

The derived value s of a KPI is indicative of how an aspect of the service is performing. In one example the search query can derive the value for the KPI by applying a late binding schema to machine data pertaining to events to extract values for a specific fields defined by the schema. In another example the search query can derive the value for that KPI by applying a late binding schema to machine data pertaining to events to extract an initial value for a specific field defined by the schema and then performing a calculation on e.g. applying a statistical function to the initial value to produce the calculation result as the KPI value. In yet another example the search query can derive the value for the KPI by applying a late binding schema to machine data pertaining to events to extract an initial value for specific fields defined by the late binding schema to find events that have certain values corresponding to the specific fields and counting the number of found events to produce the resulting number as the KPI value.

At block the computing machine optionally maps the value produced by a search query for each KPI to a state. As discussed above each KPI can have one or more states defined by one or more thresholds. In particular each threshold can define an end of a range of values. Each range of values represents a state for the KPI. At a certain point in time or a period of time the KPI can be in one of the states e.g. normal state warning state critical state depending on which range the value which is produced by the search query of the KPI falls into. For example the value produced by the Memory Usage KPI may be in the range representing a Warning State. The value produced by the CPU Usage KPI may be in the range representing a Warning State. The value produced by the Request Response Time KPI may be in the range representing a Critical State.

At block the computing machine optionally maps the state for each KPI to a rating assigned to that particular state for a respective KPI e.g. automatically or based on user input . For example for a particular KPI a user may provide input assigning a rating of 1 to the Normal State a rating of 2 to the Warning State and a rating of 3 to the Critical State. In some implementations the same ratings are assigned to the same states across the KPIs for a service. For example the Memory Usage KPI CPU Usage KPI and Request Response Time KPI for a Web Hosting service may each have Normal State with a rating of 1 a Warning State with a rating of 2 and a Critical State with a rating of 3. The computing machine can map the current state for each KPI as defined by the KPI value produced by the search query to the appropriate rating. For example the Memory Usage KPI in the Warning State can be mapped to 2. The CPU Usage KPI in the Warning State can be mapped to 2. The Request Response Time KPI in the Critical State can be mapped to 3. In some implementations different ratings are assigned to the same states across the KPIs for a service. For example the Memory Usage KPI may each have Critical State with a rating of 3 and the Request Response Time KPI may have Critical State with a rating of 5.

At block the computing machine calculates an impact score for each KPI. In some implementations the impact score of each KPI can be based on the importance weight of a corresponding KPI e.g. weight KPI value . In other implementations the impact score of each KPI can be based on the rating associated with a current state of a corresponding KPI e.g. rating KPI value . In yet other implementations the impact score of each KPI can be based on both the importance weight of a corresponding KPI and the rating associated with a current state of the corresponding KPI. For example the computing machine can apply the weight of the KPI to the rating for the state of the KPI. The impact of a particular KPI at a particular point in time on the aggregate KPI can be the product of the rating of the state of the KPI and the importance weight assigned to the KPI. In one implementation the impact score of a KPI can be calculated as follows Impact Score of KPI weight rating of state 

For example when the weight assigned to the Memory Usage KPI is 1 and the Memory Usage KPI is in a Warning State the impact score of the Memory Usage KPI 1 2. When the weight assigned to the CPU Usage KPI is 2 and the CPU Usage KPI is in a Warning State the impact score of the CPU Usage KPI 2 2. When the weight assigned to the Request Response Time KPI is 3 and the Request Response Time KPI is in a Critical State the impact score of the Request Response Time KPI 3 3.

In another implementation the impact score of a KPI can be calculated as follows Impact Score of KPI weight rating of state value 

In yet some implementations the impact score of a KPI can be calculated as follows Impact Score of KPI weight value 

At block the computing machine calculates an aggregate KPI score score for the service based on the impact scores of individual KPIs of the service. The score for the aggregate KPI indicates an overall performance of the service. The score of the aggregate KPI can be calculated periodically as configured by a user or based on a default time interval and can change over time based on the performance of different aspects of the service at different points in time. For example the aggregate KPI score may be calculated in real time continuously calculated until interrupted . The aggregate KPI score may be calculated may be calculated periodically e.g. every second .

In some implementations the score for the aggregate KPI can be determined as the sum of the individual impact scores for the KPIs of the service. In one example the aggregate KPI score for the Web Hosting service can be as follows Aggregate KPI weight rating of state weight rating of state weight rating of state 1 2 2 2 3 3 15.

In another example the aggregate KPI score for the Web Hosting service can be as follows Aggregate KPI weight rating of state value weight rating of state value weight rating of state value 1 2 60 2 2 55 3 3 80 1060.

In yet some other implementations the impact score of an aggregate KPI can be calculated as a weighted average as follows Aggregate KPI weight rating of state weight rating of state weight rating of state weight weight weight 

A KPI can have multiple values produced for the particular KPI for different points in time for example as specified by a frequency of monitoring for the particular KPI. The multiple values for a KPI can be that in a data store. In one implementation the latest value that is produced for the KPI is used for calculating the aggregate KPI score for the service and the individual impact scores used in the calculation of the aggregate KPI score can be the most recent impact scores of the individual KPIs based on the most recent values for the particular KPI stored in a data store. Alternatively a statistical function e.g. average maximum minimum etc. is performed on the set of the values that is produced for the KPI is used for calculating the aggregate KPI score for the service. The set of values can include the values over a time period between the last calculation of the aggregate KPI score and the present calculation of the aggregate KPI score. The individual impact scores used in the calculation of the aggregate KPI score can be average impact scores maximum impact score minimum impact scores etc. over a time period between the last calculation of the aggregate KPI score and the present calculation of the aggregate KPI score.

The individual impact scores for the KPIs can be calculated over a time range since the last time the KPI was calculated for the aggregate KPI score . For example for a Web Hosting service the Request Response Time KPI may have a high frequency e.g. every 2 minutes the CPU Usage KPI may have a medium frequency e.g. every 10 minutes and the Memory Usage KPI may have a low frequency e.g. every 30 minutes . That is the value for the Memory Usage KPI can be produced every 30 minutes using machine data received by the system over the last 30 minutes the value for the CPU Usage KPI can be produced every 10 minutes using machine data received by the system over the last 10 minutes and the value for the Request Response Time KPI can be produced every 2 minutes using machine data received by the system over the last 2 minutes. Depending on the point in time for when the aggregate KPI score is being calculated the value e.g. and thus state of the Memory Usage KPI may not have been refreshed the value is stale because the Memory Usage KPI has a low frequency e.g. every 30 minutes . Whereas the value e.g. and thus state of the Request Response Time KPI used to calculate the aggregate KPI score is more likely to be refreshed reflect a more current state because the Request Response Time KPI has a high frequency e.g. every 2 minutes . Accordingly some KPIs may have more impact on how the score of the aggregate KPI changes overtime than other KPIs depending on the frequency of monitoring of each KPI.

In one implementation the computing machine causes the display of the calculated aggregate KPI score in one or more graphical interfaces and the aggregate KPI score is updated in the one or more graphical interfaces each time the aggregate KPI score is calculated. In one implementation the configuration for displaying the calculated aggregate KPI in one or more graphical interfaces is received as input e.g. user input stored in a data store coupled to the computing machine and accessed by the computing machine.

At block the computing machine compares the score for the aggregate KPI to one or more thresholds. As discussed above with respect to one or more thresholds can be defined and can be configured to apply to a specific individual KPI and or an aggregate KPI including the specific individual KPI. The thresholds can be stored in a data store that is coupled to the computing machine. If the thresholds are configured to be applied to the aggregate KPI the computing machine compares the score of the aggregate KPI to the thresholds. If the computing machine determines that the aggregate KPI score exceeds or reaches any of the thresholds the computing machine determines what action should be triggered in response to this comparison.

Referring to at block the computing machine causes an action be performed based on the comparison of the aggregate KPI score with the one or more thresholds. For example the computing machine can generate an alert if the aggregate KPI score exceeds or reaches a particular threshold e.g. the highest threshold . In another example the computing machine can generate a notable event if the aggregate KPI score exceeds or reaches a particular threshold e.g. the second highest threshold . In one implementation the KPIs of multiple services is aggregated and used to create a notable event. In one implementation the configuration for which of one or more actions to be performed is received as input e.g. user input stored in a data store coupled to the computing machine and accessed by the computing machine.

In one implementation rather than having the user manually configure thresholds by adjusting the sliders or inputting numeric values as described above the system may be configured to generate suggested thresholds whether for aggregate per entity or both. In one implementation the suggested thresholds may be recommendations that can be applied to the data or that can serve as a starting point for further adjustment by the system user. The suggestions may be referred to as automatic thresholds or auto thresholds in various implementations.

At block the computing machine receives user input requesting generation of threshold suggestions. In one implementation a user may select a generate suggestions button that when selected initiates an auto threshold determination process. Rather than having the user manually configure thresholds by adjusting the sliders or inputting numeric values as described above the system may be configured to generate suggested thresholds whether for aggregate per entity or both.

At block the computing machine receives user input indicating a method of threshold generation. For example upon selection of the generate suggestions button a threshold configuration GUI may be displayed. The threshold configuration GUI may have a number of selectable tabs that allow the user to select the method of auto threshold determination. In one implementation the methods include even splits percentiles and standard deviation. The even splits method takes the range of values displayed in a graph and divides that range into a number of threshold ranges that each correspond to a KPI state for the selected service. In one implementation the threshold ranges are all evenly sized. In another implementation the threshold ranges may vary in size. In one implementation the threshold ranges may be referred to as Fixed Intervals such that the size of the range does not change but that one range may be of a different size than another range. The percentiles method takes the calculated KPI values and shows the distribution of those values divided into some number of percentile groups that each correspond to a KPI state for the selected service. The standard deviation method takes the calculated KPI values and shows the distribution of those values divided into some number of groups based on standard deviation from the mean value that each correspond to a KPI state for the selected service.

At block the computing machine receives user input indicating the severity ordering of the thresholds. The severity ordering refers to whether higher or lower values correspond to a more severe KPI state. In one implementation a drop down menu may be provided that allows the user to select a severity ordering from among three options including higher values are more critical lower values are more critical and higher and lower values are more critical. When the higher values are more critical option is selected the state names are ordered such that they proceed in descending order from higher threshold values to lower threshold values. The descending order of state names refers to a progression from most severe to least severe. The ascending order of state names refers to the a progression from least severe to most severe. When the lower values are more critical option is selected the state names are ordered such that they proceed in ascending order from lower threshold values to higher threshold values. When the higher and lower values are more critical option is selected the state names are ordered such that they proceed in descending order from higher threshold values to some lower threshold values and then back up again on the severity scale as the threshold values continue to decrease. In such a case the state names may appear as though they are reflected in order about a center point with state names associated with greater severity ordered farther from the center.

At block depending on the selected method of threshold generation the computing machine optionally receives user input indicating the time range of data for calculating threshold suggestions. The computing machine may analyze data from the selected time range in order to generate the threshold suggestions rather than analyzing all available data at least some of which may be stale or not relevant. The actual values that correspond to the boundaries of the threshold groups may not be determined until a period of time over which the values are to be calculated is selected from a pull down menu. Examples of the period of time may include the last 60 minutes the last day the last week etc. In one implementation a period of time over which the values are to be calculated is selected when the method of auto thresholding includes percentiles or standard deviation. In one implementation no period of time is required when the even splits method is suggested.

At block the computing machine generates threshold suggestions based on the received user input. Upon selection of the period of time the actual values that correspond to the boundaries of the threshold groups are calculated and displayed in the GUI. The user may be able to adjust edit add or delete thresholds from this GUI as described above.

In GUI of a number of tabs may be provided that allow the user to select the method of auto threshold determination. In one implementation the even splits tab may be selected. The even splits method takes the range of values from the second vertical axis displayed in the graph and divides that range into a number of even threshold ranges that each correspond to a state of the selected service. In one embodiment there may be a default number of threshold ranges e.g. each corresponding to a different state i.e. critical high medium low normal . In one implementation the threshold ranges are displayed in GUI along with the state corresponding to each range and what percentage of the total range of values from graph are represented by each threshold range. The actual values that correspond to the boundaries of the threshold ranges may also be displayed in GUI . According to the example illustrated in AD the range of values for the access latency on disks of a storage appliance from graph include 101.14 to 915.74 milliseconds. GUI shows that the critical state includes values above 83.3 which corresponds to values above 745.921 milliseconds. Similarly the high state includes values between 66.7 and 83.3 which corresponds to values between 577.119 milliseconds and 745.921 milliseconds and so on. GUI provides the ability for the user to rename the states adjust the associated percentages that correspond to each state and to add or remove displayed states as well. When the even splits tab is selected upon the addition or removal of a state GUI may display recalculated values so that the range of values corresponding to each state remains equal in size.

Once configuration of thresholds in the even splits tab is completed horizontal bands corresponding to each state may be displayed on chart as illustrated in . As shown the range of values represented by each band is equal since the thresholds were set using the even splits method. In one implementation the names of the states and corresponding values representing the end of the threshold ranges are also displayed adjacent to chart . The user may similarly be able to adjust edit add or delete thresholds from this GUI as described above.

In GUI of a drop down menu may be provided that allows the user to select a severity ordering. In one implementation there are three options for severity ordering including higher values are more critical lower values are more critical and higher and lower values are more critical. When the higher values are more critical option is selected the state names are ordered such that they proceed in descending order from higher threshold values to lower threshold values e.g. high is above 661.52 medium is between 661.52 and 407.3 normal is between 407.3 and 153.08 and so on . The severity ordering may be selected depending on the underlying KPI values. For example a user may desire to set thresholds that warn them when certain values are getting too high e.g. processor load but when other values are getting too low e.g. memory space remaining . In GUI of the user has selected the option for lower values are more critical . When the lower values are more critical option is selected the state names are ordered such that they proceed in descending order from lower threshold values to higher threshold values e.g. high is below 68.679 medium is between 68.679 and 237.481 low is between 237.481 and 407.3 and so on . The corresponding order of states would also be reflected in chart .

In GUI of the user has selected the option for higher and lower values are more critical. When the higher and lower values are more critical option is selected the state names are ordered such that they proceed in descending order from higher threshold values to lower threshold values and then back up again on the severity scale as the threshold values continue to decrease e.g. high is above 704.229 or between 110.371 and 25.97 medium is between 704.229 and 618.811 or between 195.789 and 110.371 low is between 618.811 and 534.41 or between 280.19 and 195.789 and so on . The higher and lower values are more critical option could be applicable to any KPI where the user wants to be warned if the value differs from an expected value by a certain amount in either direction e.g. temperature . The corresponding order of states would also be reflected in chart as shown in . Once configuration of thresholds is completed horizontal bands corresponding to each state may be displayed on chart . As shown the range of values represented by each band is equal since the thresholds were set using the even splits method. In one implementation the names of the states and corresponding values representing the end of the threshold ranges are also displayed adjacent to chart . The user may similarly be able to adjust edit add or delete thresholds from this GUI as described above.

In GUI of the method of auto threshold determination is selected using the percentiles tab . The percentiles method takes the calculated KPI values and shows the distribution of those values divided into some number of percentile groups that each correspond to a state of the selected service. In one embodiment there may be a default number of threshold groups e.g. 5 each corresponding to a different state i.e. critical high medium low normal . In one implementation the threshold groups are displayed in GUI along with the state and percentile corresponding to each. The actual values that correspond to the boundaries of the threshold groups are not displayed until a period of time over which the values are to be calculated is selected from pull down menu . Examples of the period of time may include the last 60 minutes the last day the last week etc.

Upon selection of the period of time the actual values that correspond to the boundaries of the threshold groups are displayed in GUI as shown in . According to the example illustrated in the critical state includes values above the 90percentile indicating that 90 of the calculated values are below this state which corresponds to an actual value of 401.158 milliseconds. Similarly the high state includes values between the 90and 75percentiles which correspond to values between 401.158 milliseconds and 341.737 milliseconds and so on. GUI provides the ability for the user to rename the states adjust the associated percentages that correspond to each state and to add or remove displayed states as well. Once configuration of thresholds in the percentiles tab is completed horizontal bands corresponding to each state may be displayed on chart as illustrated in . As shown the range of values represented by each band varies according to the distribution of the data since the thresholds were set using the percentiles method. In one implementation the names of the states and corresponding values representing the end of the threshold ranges are also displayed adjacent to chart . The user may similarly be able to adjust edit add or delete thresholds from this GUI as described above.

In GUI of the method of auto threshold determination is selected using the standard deviation tab . The standard deviation method takes the calculated KPI values and shows the distribution of those values divided into some number of groups based on standard deviation from the mean value that each correspond to a state of the selected service. In one embodiment there may be a default number of threshold groups e.g. 5 each corresponding to a different state i.e. critical high medium low normal . In one implementation the threshold groups are displayed in GUI along with the state and number of standard deviations corresponding to each. The actual values that correspond to the boundaries of the threshold groups are not displayed until a period of time over which the values are to be calculated is selected from pull down menu .

Upon selection of the period of time the actual values that correspond to the boundaries of the threshold groups are displayed in GUI as shown in FIG. AN. According to the example illustrated in the critical state includes values above the 2 standard deviations from the mean which corresponds to an actual value of 582.825 milliseconds. Similarly the high state includes values between 1 and 2 standard deviations from the mean which corresponds to values between 582.825 milliseconds and 436.704 milliseconds and so on. GUI provides the ability for the user to rename the states adjust the associated percentages that correspond to each state and to add or remove displayed states as well. Once configuration of thresholds in the standard deviation tab is completed horizontal bands corresponding to each state may be displayed on chart as illustrated in . As shown the range of values represented by each band varies according to the distribution of the data since the thresholds were set using the standard deviation method. In one implementation the names of the states and corresponding values representing the end of the threshold ranges are also displayed adjacent to chart . The user may similarly be able to adjust edit add or delete thresholds from this GUI as described above.

As discussed above the aggregate KPI score a service can be used to generate notable events and or alarms according to one or more implementations of the present disclosure. In another implementation a correlation search is created and used to generate notable event s and or alarm s . A correlation search can be created to determine the status of a set of KPIs for a service over a defined window of time. Thresholds can be set on the distribution of the state of each individual KPI and if the distribution thresholds are exceeded then an alert alarm can be generated.

The correlation search can be based on a discrete mathematical calculation. For example the correlation search can include for each KPI included in the correlation search the following sum crit threshold crit sum crit sum warn threshold crit threshold warn sum crit sum warn sum normal threshold crit threshold warn threshold normal 

Input e.g. user input can be received that defines one or more thresholds for the counts of each state in a defined e.g. user defined time window for each KPI. The thresholds define a distribution for the respective KPI. The distribution shift between states for the respective KPI can be determined. When the distribution for a respective KPI shifts toward a particular state e.g. critical state the KPI can be categorized accordingly. The distribution shift for each KPI can be determined and each KPI can be categorized accordingly. When the KPIs for a service a categorized the categorized KPIs can be compared to criteria for triggering a notable event. If the criteria are satisfied a notable event can be triggered.

For example a Web Hosting service may have three KPIs 1 CPU Usage 2 Memory Usage and 3 Request Response Time. The counts for each state a defined e.g. user defined time window for the CPU Usage KPI can be determined and the distribution thresholds can be applied to the counts. The distribution for the CPU Usage KPI may shift towards a critical state and the CPU Usage KPI is flagged as critical accordingly. The counts for each state in a defined time window for the Memory Usage KPI can be determined and the distribution thresholds for the Memory Usage KPI may also shift towards a critical state and the Memory Usage KPI is flagged as critical accordingly.

The counts of each state in a defined time window for the Request Response Time KPI can be determined and the distribution thresholds for the Request Response Time KPI can be applied to the counts. The distribution for the Request Response Time KPI may also shift towards a critical state and the Request Response Time KPI is flagged as critical accordingly. The categories for the KPIs can be compared to the one or more criteria for triggering a notable event and a notable event is triggered as a result of each of the CPU Usage KPI Memory Usage KPI and Request Response Time KPI being flagged as critical.

Input e.g. user input can be received specifying one or more criteria for triggering a notable event. For example the criteria may be that when all of the KPIs in the correlation search for a service are flagged categorized a critical state a notable event is triggered. In another example the criteria may be that when a particular KPIs is flagged a particular state for a particular number of times a notable event is triggered. Each KPI can be assigned a set of criteria.

For example a Web Hosting service may have three KPIs 1 CPU Usage 2 Memory Usage and 3 Request Response Time. The counts of each state in a defined e.g. user defined time window for the CPU Usage KPI can be determined and the distribution thresholds can be applied to the counts. The distribution for the CPU Usage KPI may shift towards a critical state and the CPU Usage KPI is flagged as critical accordingly. The counts of each state in a defined time window for the Memory Usage KPI can be determined and the distribution thresholds for the Memory Usage KPI can be applied to the counts. The distribution for the Memory Usage KPI may also shift towards a critical state and the Memory Usage KPI is flagged as critical accordingly. The counts of each state in a defined time window for the Request Response Time KPI can be determined and the distribution thresholds for the Request Response Time KPI can be applied to the counts. The distribution for the Request Response Time KPI may also shift towards a critical state and the Request Response Time KPI is flagged as critical accordingly. The categories for the KPIs can be compared to the one or more criteria for triggering a notable event and a notable event is triggered as a result of each of the CPU Usage KPI Memory Usage KPI and Request Response Time KPI being flagged as critical.

Referring to each time a KPI value is calculated for each KPI A B the value can be mapped to a state A B e.g. Critical C High H Medium M Low L Normal N and Informational I based on for example the KPI thresholds that are set for a particular KPI. The thresholds that map a KPI value to a KPI state may differ between KPIs. For example a value of 75 may be calculated for KPI1 A and the value 75 may map to a High state for KPI1 A. In another example the same value of 75 may be calculated for KPI2 BA but the value 75 may map to a Critical state for KPI2 B. One implementation for configuring thresholds for a KPI is described above in conjunction with .

Referring to each time a value and corresponding state is determined for each KPI the KPI value and corresponding KPI state are stored as part of KPI data for the particular KPI in a service monitoring data store. The service monitoring data store can store KPI data for any number of KPIs for any number of services.

A KPI correlation search definition can be specified for searching the KPI data in the service monitoring data store to identify particular KPI data and evaluating the particular KPI data for a trigger determination to determine whether to cause a defined action. A KPI correlation search definition can contain i information for a search ii information for a triggering determination and iii a defined action that may be performed based on the triggering determination.

The information for the search identifies the KPI names and corresponding KPI information such as values or states to search for in the service monitoring data store. The search information can pertain to multiple KPIs. For example in response to user input the search information may pertain to KPI1 A and KPI2 B. A KPI that is used for the search can be an aspect KPI that indicates how a particular aspect of a service is performing or an aggregate KPI that indicates how the service as a whole is performing. The KPIs that are used for the search can be from different services.

The search information can include one or more KPI name State value pairs KPI State pair for each KPI that is selected for the KPI correlation search. Each KPI State pair identifies which KPI and which state to search for. For example the KPI1 Critical pair specifies to search for KPI values of KPI1 A that are mapped to a Critical State A. The KPI1 High pair specifies to search for KPI values of KPI1 A that are mapped to a High State B.

The information for the search can include a duration A B specifying the time period to arrive at data that should be used for the search. For example the duration A B may be the Last 60 minutes which indicates that the search should use the last 60 minutes of data. The duration A B can be applied to each KPI State pair.

The information for the search can include a frequency specifying when to execute the KPI correlation search. For example the frequency may be every 30 minutes. For example when the KPI correlation search is executed at time in timeline a search may be performed to identify KPI values of KPI1 A that are mapped to a Critical State A within the last 60 minutes A and to identify KPI values of KPI1 A that are mapped to a High State B within the last 60 minutes A.

For KPI2 B the search may be performed at time based on three KPI State pairs. For example the search may be performed to identify KPI values of KPI2 B that are mapped to a Critical State A within the last 60 minutes B KPI values of KPI2 B that are mapped to a High State B within the last 60 minutes B and KPI values of KPI2 B that are mapped to a Medium State C within the last 60 minutes B.

The information for a trigger determination can include one or more trigger criteria A E for evaluating the results e.g. KPIs having particular states of executing the search specified by the search information to determine whether to cause a defined action . There can be a trigger criterion A E for each KPI State pair that is specified in the search information. The trigger criterion A E for each KPI State pair can include a contribution threshold A E that represents a statistic related to occurrences of a particular KPI state. In one implementation a contribution threshold A E includes an operator e.g. greater than greater than or equal to equal to less than and less than or equal to a threshold value and a statistical function e.g. percentage count . For example the contribution threshold A for the trigger criterion A may be greater than 29.5 which is directed to the number of occurrences of the critical KPI state for KPI1 A that exceeds 29.5 of the total number of all KPI states determined for KPI1 A over the last 60 minutes. For example the state for KPI A is determined 61 times over the last 60 minutes and the KPI correlation search evaluates whether KPI A has been in a critical state more than 29.5 of the 61 determinations. The total number of states in the duration is determined by the quotient of duration and frequency. The total number can be calculated based upon KPI monitoring frequency defined in a KPI definition and search time defined in the KPI correlation search. For example total selected time frequency time .

In one implementation when there are multiple trigger criteria pertaining to a particular KPI the KPI correlation search processes the multiple trigger criteria pertaining to the particular KPI disjunctively i.e. their results are logically OR ed . For example the KPI correlation search can include trigger criterion A and trigger criterion B pertaining to KPI1 A. If either trigger criterion A or trigger criterion B is satisfied the KPI correlation search positively indicates the satisfaction of trigger criteria for KPI1 A. In another example the KPI correlation search can include trigger criterion C trigger criterion D and trigger criterion E pertaining to KPI2 B. If any one or more of trigger criterion C trigger criterion D and trigger criterion E is satisfied the KPI correlation search positively indicates the satisfaction of trigger criteria for KPI2 B.

In one implementation when multiple KPIs e.g. KPI1 and KPI2 are specified in the search information the KPI correlation search treats the multiple KPIs conjunctively in determining whether the correlation search trigger condition has been met. That is to say the KPI correlation search must positively indicate the satisfaction of trigger criteria for every KPI in the search or the defined action will not be performed. For example only after the KPI correlation search positively indicates the satisfaction of trigger criteria for both KPI1 A and KPI2 B will the determination be made that the correlation search trigger condition has been met and defined action can be performed. Said another way satisfaction of the trigger criteria for a correlation search is determined by first logically OR ing together evaluations of the trigger criteria within each KPI and then logically AND ing together those OR ed results from all the KPI s.

The KPI correlation search definition structure includes one or more components. A component may pertain to search information or trigger determination information for the KPI correlation search definition. Each KPI correlation search definition component relates to a characteristic of the KPI correlation search. For example there is a KPI correlation search name component one or more record selection components for the information for the search a duration component a frequency component for the frequency of executing the KPI correlation search one or more contribution threshold components for the information for the triggering determination one or more action components one or more related services components and one or more components for other information . The characteristic of the KPI correlation search being represented by a particular component is the particular KPI correlation search definition component s type.

One or more of the KPI correlation search definition components can store information for an element. The information can include an element name and one or more element values for the element. In one implementation an element name element value s pair within a KPI correlation search definition component can serve as a field name field value pair for a search query. In one implementation the search query is directed to search a service monitoring data store storing service monitoring data pertaining to the service monitoring system. The service monitoring data can include and is not limited to KPI data e.g. KPI values KPI states timestamps etc. and KPI specifications.

In one example an element name element value pair in the search information in the KPI correlation search definition can be used to search the KPI data in the service monitoring data store for the KPI data that has matching values for the elements that are named in the search information .

The search information can include one or more record selection components to identify the KPI names and or corresponding KPI states to search for in the service monitoring data store e.g. KPI state pairs . For example the record selection component can include a KPH Critical pair that specifies a search for values for KPH corresponding to a Critical state. In one implementation there are multiple KPI state pairs in a record selection component to represent various states that are selected for a particular KPI for the KPI correlation search definition. For example two states for KPI1 may be selected for the KPI correlation search definition. The record selection component can include another KPI state pair KPI1 High pair that specifies a search for values for KPI1 corresponding to a High state. In one implementation a single KPI name can correspond to multiple state values. For example the record selection component can include a KPI state pair KPI1 Critical High . In one implementation the multiple values are treated disjunctively. For example a search query may search for values for KPI1 corresponding to a Critical state or a High state. In one implementation the KPI is continuously monitored and the states of the KPI are stored in the service monitoring data store. The KPI correlation search searches the service monitoring data store for the particular states specified in the search information in the KPI correlation search.

There can be one or multiple components having the same KPI correlation search definition component type. For example there can be multiple record selection components to represent multiple KPIs. For example there can be a record selection component to store KPI state value pairs for KPI1 and another record selection component to store KPI state value pairs for KPI2. In one implementation some combination of a single and multiple components of the same type are used to store information pertaining to a KPI correlation search in a KPI correlation search definition.

In one implementation the search information includes a duration component to specify the time period to arrive at data that should be searched for the KPI state pairs. For example the duration may be the Last 60 minutes and the KPI states that are to be extracted by execution of the KPI correlation search can be from the last 60 minutes. In another implementation the duration component is not part of the search information .

The trigger determination information can include one or more trigger criteria for evaluating the results of executing the search specified by the search information to determine whether to cause a defined action. The trigger criteria can include a contribution threshold component for each KPI state pair in the record selection components . Each contribution threshold component can include an operator e.g. greater than greater than or equal to equal to less than and less than or equal to a threshold value and a statistical function e.g. percentage count . For example the contribution threshold may be greater than 29.5 .

The action component can specify an action to be performed when the trigger criteria are considered to be satisfied. An action can include and is not limited to generating a notable event sending a notification and displaying information in an incident review interface as described in greater detail below in conjunction with . The related services component can include information identifying services to which the KPI s specified in the search information pertain. The frequency component can include information specifying when to execute the KPI correlation search. For example the KPI correlation search may be executed every 30 minutes.

A KPI correlation search definition can include a single KPI correlation search name component that contains the identifying information e.g. name title key and or identifier for the KPI correlation search. The value in the name component can be used as the KPI correlation search identifier for the KPI correlation search being represented by the KPI correlation search definition. For example the name component may include an element name of name and an element value of KPI Correlation 1846a1cf 8eef 4 . The value KPI Correlation 1846a1cf Beef 4 becomes the KPI correlation search identifier for the KPI correlation search that is being represented by KPI correlation search definition.

Various implementations may use a variety of data representation and or organization for the component information in a KPI correlation search definition based on such factors as performance data density site conventions and available application infrastructure for example. The structure e.g. structure in of a KPI correlation search definition can include rows entries or tuples to depict components of a KPI correlation search definition. A KPI correlation search definition component can be a normalized tabular representation for the component as can be used in an implementation such as an implementation storing the KPI correlation search definition within an RDBMS. Different implementations may use different representations for component information for example representations that are not normalized and or not tabular. Different implementations may use various data storage and retrieval frameworks a JSON based database as one example to facilitate storing KPI correlations search definitions KPI correlation search definition records . Further within an implementation some information may be implied by for example the position within a defined data structure or schema where a value such as Critical is stored rather than being stored explicitly. For example in an implementation having a defined data structure for a KPI correlation search definition where the first data item is defined to be the value of the name element for the name component of the KPI correlation search only the value need be explicitly stored as the KPI correlation search component and the element name name are known from the data structure definition.

At block the computing machine causes display of a graphical user interface GUI that includes a correlation search portion that enables a user to specify information for a KPI correlation search definition. An example GUI that enables a user to specify information for a KPI correlation search definition is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Referring to the KPI correlation search definition can include i information for a search ii information for a triggering determination and iii a defined action that may be performed based on the triggering determination. The information for the search identifies KPI values in a data store. Each KPI value is indicative of a KPI state. Each of the KPI values in the data store is derived from machine data pertaining to one or more entities identified in a service definition for a service using a search query specified by a KPI definition associated with the service.

The information for the trigger determination includes trigger criteria. The trigger determination evaluates the identified KPI values using the trigger criteria to determine whether to cause a defined action.

At block the computing machine causes display of a trigger criteria interface for a particular KPI definition that is specified in the KPI correlation search definition. An example trigger criteria interface is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Referring to at block the computing machine receives user input via the trigger criteria interface for the particular KPI definition KPI selecting one or more states. The KPI can be associated with one or more states. Example states can include and are not limited to Critical High Medium Low Normal and Informational. The states can be configurable. The trigger criteria interface is populated based on the states that are defined for the particular KPI for example via GUI in .

Referring to at block the computing machine receives user input specifying a contribution threshold for each selected state via the trigger criteria interface. In one implementation a contribution threshold includes an operator e.g. greater than greater than or equal to equal to less than and less than or equal to a threshold value and a statistical function e.g. percentage count . For example the contribution threshold for a particular state may be greater than 29.5 .

At block the computing machine determines whether one or more contribution thresholds are to be specified for another KPI that is included in the KPI correlation search definition. The KPI correlation search definition may specify multiple KPIs e.g. KPH A and KPI2 B in .

If one or more contribution thresholds are to be specified for another KPI the computing machine returns to block to cause the display of a trigger criteria interface that corresponds to the other KPI and user input can be received selecting one or more states at block . User input can be received specifying a contribution threshold for each selected state at block .

If no other contribution thresholds are to be specified for another KPI block the computing machine stores the contribution threshold s as trigger criteria information of the KPI correlation search definition at block . In one implementation the contribution threshold s are stored in contribution threshold components e.g. contribution threshold components in in a KPI correlation search definition.

GUI can include a list of correlation searches that have been defined. GUI can include a button for creating a new correlation search. When the button is activated a list of the types of correlation search e.g. correlation search KPI correlation search that can be created is displayed. A KPI correlation search includes searching for specific data produced for one or more KPI s and evaluating that data against a trigger condition so as to cause a predefined action when satisfied. In one embodiment the KPI correlation search in this context of GUI element includes a search for KPI state values or indicators for one or more KPI s and evaluating that data against a trigger condition specified using state related trigger criteria for each KPI so as to cause a predefined action such as posting a notable event when satisfied. A correlation search in the context of GUI element includes searching for specified data and evaluating that data against a trigger condition so as to cause a predefined action when satisfied as described in greater detail in conjunction with . When an item in the list for creating a KPI correlation search is activated a GUI for defining a KPI correlation search is displayed as described below.

In one implementation the services in the list are ranked. In one implementation the ranking of the services in the list is based on the KPI values of the services in the service monitoring data store. As described above for each KPI of a service the KPI values can be calculated for a service based on a monitoring period that is set for the KPI. The calculated KPI values can be stored as part of KPI data in the service monitoring data store. The ranking of the services can be based on for example the number of KPI values that are stored for a service the timestamps for the KPI values etc. For example the monitoring period for a KPI may be every 5 minutes and the values are calculated for the KPI every 5 minutes. In another example the monitoring period for a KPI may be set to zero and the KPI values may not be calculated. For example if Sample Service has 10 KPIs but the monitoring period for each of the KPIs has been set to zero then the values for the 10 KPIs will not have been calculated and stored in the service monitoring data store. Sample Service will then be ranked below than other services with KPI monitoring periods greater than zero in the list .

One or more services in the list can be selected via a selection box e.g. check box that is displayed for each service in the list . When a service e.g. Monitor CPU Load is selected from the list via a corresponding check box dependency boxes can be displayed for the corresponding selected service. The dependency boxes allow a user to optionally further specify whether to select the service s that depend on the selected service e.g. Monitor CPU Load and or to select the services which the selected service e.g. Monitor CPU Load depends upon. As described above a particular service can depend on one or more other services and or one or more other services can depend on the particular service.

When one or more services are selected from the list the KPIs that correspond to the selected services can be displayed in the KPI portion in the GUI . For example the KPI KPI for CPU Load corresponds to the selected service Monitor CPU Load and the KPI Memo Load corresponds to the selected service Check Mem Load on Environment . When a service is selected from the list and its Depends on or Impacts check box is selected the KPI s that correspond to the services having the indicated dependency relationship with the selected service can be displayed in the KPI portion in the GUI as well. The KPI portion can be populated using data e.g. KPI definitions KPI values KPI thresholds etc. that is stored in the service monitoring data store.

The KPI portion can include KPI data for the KPIs of the selected services. In one implementation the KPI data is presented in a tabular format in the KPI portion . The KPI data can include a header row and followed by one or more data rows. Each data row can correspond to a particular KPI. The KPI data can include one or more columns for each row. The header row can include column identifiers to represent the KPI data that is being presented in the KPI portion . For example the KPI data can include for each row a column that has the KPI name a column for the service name of the service that pertains to the particular KPI and a column for a KPI health indicator .

The KPI health indicator for each KPI can represent the performance of the corresponding KPI for a duration specified via button . For example the duration of the Last 15 Minutes has been selected as indicated by button and the KPI health indicator for each KPI can represent the performance of the corresponding KPI for the last 15 minutes relative to the point in time when the KPI data was displayed in the GUI .

In one implementation GUI includes a filtering text box to provide an index based case sensitive search functionality to filter out services. For example if the service name is Cpu load monitor service a user can search using different options such as C . c cpu Cpu load and cpu load monitor service . In one implementation GUI includes a filtering text box to provide an index based case insensitive search for KPI name service name and severity name. The text box can support key value index based case insensitive search. For example for a selected service Cpu load monitor service there may be a KPI with named Cpu percent load which is monitored every minute and has state data with low 2 critical 9 high 4. A user can perform a search using for example a name KPI or Service key value pair. For example 1 2 or low 2 can return all KPIs where low 2. In another example where high 4 the search can return all KPIs where high value is 4.

When button is activated for example to select a different duration a GUI enabling a user to specify a duration for determining the performance of the KPI is displayed. illustrates an example GUI for facilitating user input specifying a duration to use for a KPI correlation search in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. When button is activated list can be displayed. The list can include buttons A E for selecting a duration for specifying the time period to arrive at data that should be searched for the KPI state pairs. When button A is selected a list of preset durations is displayed. The list can include durations e.g. Last 15 minutes that are relative to the execution of the KPI correlation search and other types of preset durations e.g. All time . For example the duration that is selected may be the Last 15 minutes which points to the last 15 minutes of data from the time the KPI correlation search is executed that should be searched for the KPI state pairs.

When button B is selected an interface for defining a relative duration is displayed. The interface can include a text box for specifying a string indicating the relative duration to use. For example user input can be received via the text box specifying the Last 3 days as the duration. When button C is selected an interface for defining a date range for the duration is displayed. For example user input can be received specifying the date range between 12 18 2014 and 12 19 2014 as the duration. When button D is selected an interface for defining a date and time range for the duration is displayed. For example user input can be received specifying the earliest date time of 12 18 2014 12 24 00 and the latest date time of 12 158 2014 13 24 56 as the duration. When button E is selected an interface for an advanced definition for the duration is displayed. For example user input can be received specifying the duration using search processing language. The selected duration can be stored in a duration component e.g. duration component in in a KPI correlation search definition.

Referring to the KPI portion can display an expansion button for each KPI in the KPI data . When an expansion button is activated the KPI portion displays detailed performance data for the corresponding KPI for the selected duration e.g. Last 15 minutes .

The detailed performance interface can include a list of states that have been defined for the particular KPI. In one implementation the states in the list are defined for the particular KPI via GUIs in described above. Referring to in one implementation the states are displayed in a color that corresponds to a color that was defined for the particular state when the KPI thresholds for the particular KPI were defined.

The detailed performance interface can include a statistic for each state in the list which corresponds to the occurrences of a specific KPI state over duration . For example the KPI KPI for CPU Load may have a monitoring period of every one minute and the value for the KPI KPI for CPU Load is calculated every minute. The statistic e.g. 61 indicates how the KPI KPI for CPU Load performs during time period of Last 60 Minutes which shows that the KPI has been in a Medium state 61 times over the time period of Last 60 Minutes. The total for the counts in the list corresponds to the number of calculations performed according to the monitoring period e.g. every minute of the KPI during time period e.g. for the last 60 minutes specified for the KPI correlation search.

The detailed performance interface can include an open KPI search button which when selected displays a search GUI presenting the search query defining the KPI. The detailed performance interface can include an edit KPI button which when selected can display a GUI for editing the definition of the particular KPI. The detailed performance interface can include a deep dive button which when selected can display a GUI for presenting a deep dive visualization for the particular KPI.

Referring to one or more KPIs in the KPI portion can be selected for the KPI correlation search definition. Each KPI in the KPI portion can have a selection box and or a selection link for selecting individual KPIs. The KPI portion can include a bulk selection box for selecting all of the KPIs in the KPI portion . A bulk action link e.g. add to selection link A view in deep dive link B can be activated to apply an action e.g. select for KPI correlation search definition view in deep dive to the selected KPIs.

The one or more KPIs that have been selected from the KPI portion can be used to populate the correlation search portion as described in greater detail below. In one implementation when one or more KPIs have been selected from the KPI portion a trigger criteria interface for a particular KPI is displayed. In one implementation the trigger criteria interface for the first selected KPI in the KPI portion is displayed. For example if the KPI KPI for CPU Load and the KPI Mem Load have been selected the trigger criteria interface for the KPI KPI for CPU Load is displayed as described below in conjunction with .

The trigger criteria interface enables a user to specify triggering conditions for the particular KPI to trigger a defined action e.g. generate a notable event send notification display information in an incident review interface etc. . The trigger criteria interface can display for each state defined for the particular KPI a selection box a slider bar with a slider element an operator indicator a value text box a statistical function indicator and a state identifier .

In one implementation when the trigger criteria interface is first displayed for example in response to a user selection of the particular KPI the trigger criteria interface automatically displays the information reflecting the current performance of the states for the particular KPI based on the selected duration e.g. Last 60 minutes . For example the performance of the KPI as illustrated by indicators A and B can be presented in the trigger criteria interface . For example the trigger criteria interface may initially only display the information in portion indicating that the KPI was in the Low state 100 for the last 60 minutes. A user may use the currently displayed data as a contribution threshold for the particular state.

User input selecting one or more states can be received for example via the selection box slider element and value text box for a particular state. A contribution threshold can be specified for each selected state via user interaction with the trigger criteria interface as described in greater detail below.

For each selected state user input of a contribution threshold can be received. The user input can include an operator e.g. greater than greater than or equal to equal to less than and less than or equal to a threshold value and a statistical function e.g. percentage count . The user input for the operator can be received via an operator indicator which when selected can display a list of operators to select from. For example a greater than e.g. operator has been selected.

The user input of the statistical function to be used can be received via a statistical function indicator which when selected can display a list of statistical functions e.g. percent count etc. to select from. For example the percentage function has been selected.

The user input for the threshold value can be received for example via a value entered in the text box and or via a slider element . In one implementation when a user slides the slider element across a corresponding slider bar to select a value the corresponding value can be displayed in the corresponding text box . In one implementation when a user provides a value in the text box the slider element is moved e.g. automatically without any user interaction to a position in the slider bar that corresponds to the value. Text box and slider control element are accordingly operatively coupled. For example the value 29.5 has been selected. In one embodiment slider bar appears in relationship with an actuals data graph bar. The actuals data graph bar depicts a value determined from actual data for the associated KPI in the associated state over the current working time interval e.g. the Last 60 minutes of of . The actuals data graph bar can be narrower or wider than the slider bar appear in front of or behind the slider bar be centered on axis with the slider bar be visually distinct from the slider bar e.g. a darker lighter variant or different color or have a different pattern texture or fill than the slider bar and have the same scaling as the slider bar.

In one implementation when a trigger criterion has been specified for a particular state one or more visual indicators are presented in the trigger criteria interface for the particular state. For example the contribution threshold for the Critical state may be greater than 29.5 and the contribution threshold for the High state may be greater than 84.5 and visual indicators are displayed for the two trigger criteria A B that have been specified.

For example for the Critical state the trigger criteria interface can present the selection box as being enabled the slider bar as having a distinct visual characteristic to visually represent a corresponding value using a scale of the slider bar the slider element as being shaded or colored an operator indicator as being highlighted a value being displayed in a text box a statistical function indicator being highlighted and or a state identifier being highlighted. The distinct visual characteristic for the slider bar can be a color a pattern a shade a shape or any combination of color pattern shade and shape as well as any other visual characteristics.

In one implementation when multiple trigger criteria are specified for a particular KPI the trigger criteria are processed disjunctively. For example the trigger criteria of the KPI can be considered satisfied if either the KPI is in the Critical state more than 29.5 within the duration e.g. Last 60 minutes or the KPI is in the High state more than 84.5 within the duration.

GUI can include a save button which when activated can display another trigger criteria interface that corresponds to another KPI if another KPI has been selected for the KPI correlation search. If no other KPIs have been selected for the KPI correlation search a GUI for creating the KPI correlation search based on the KPI correlation search definition is displayed.

The information for each KPI can include the name of the KPI the service which the KPI pertains to KPI performance indicator and a trigger criteria indicator A for the particular KPI. The correlation search portion can include a selection button and or a link for each KPI for receiving user input specifying that the selected KPI should be removed from the KPI correlation search definition.

The trigger criteria indicators A B for a particular KPI can display the number of trigger criteria that has been specified for the KPI. For example KPI A may have two trigger criteria e.g. Critical state more than 29.5 within the duration High state more than 84.5 within the duration .

In one implementation the trigger criteria indicators A B are links which when selected can display a corresponding trigger criteria interface e.g. trigger criteria interface in for the particular KPI to enable a user to edit the trigger criteria.

The correlation search portion can include summary information that includes the information for a trigger determination for the KPI correlation search to determine whether to cause a defined action e.g. generate notable event sending a notification display information in an incident review interface . The summary information can include the number of KPIs that are specified in the KPI correlation search definition and the total number of trigger criteria for the KPI correlation search.

As described above in one implementation when there are multiple trigger criteria that pertain to a particular KPI the trigger criteria are processed disjunctively. For example if one of the two triggers that have been specified for KPI A are satisfied then the trigger criteria for KPI A are considered satisfied. If any one of the three triggers that have been specified for KPI B are satisfied then the trigger criteria for KPI B are considered satisfied.

In one implementation when there are multiple KPIs that are specified in the KPI correlation search definition the multiple KPIs are treated conjunctively. Each KPI must have at least one trigger criteria satisfied in order for all of the triggering criteria that are specified in the KPI correlation search definition to be considered satisfied. For example when any of the two trigger criteria for KPI1 A is satisfied and any of the three trigger criteria for KPI2 B is satisfied then the trigger condition determined using five trigger criteria is considered satisfied for the KPI correlation search and a defined action can be performed. If none of the two trigger criteria for KPI1 is satisfied A or none of the three trigger criteria for KPI2 B is satisfied then the trigger condition for the KPI correlation search is considered as not being satisfied.

The correlation search portion can include a create button which when activated displays a GUI for creating the KPI correlation search as a saved search based on the KPI correlation search definition that has been specified using for example GUI .

A user e.g. business analyst can provide a name for the KPI correlation search optionally a title for the KPI correlation search and optionally a description for the KPI correlation search. In one implementation when a title is specified the title is used when an action is performed. For example if no title is specified the name can be displayed in an incident review interface if an action of displaying information in the incident review interface has been triggered. In another example if a title is specified the title can be displayed in an incident review interface if an action of displaying information in the incident review interface has been triggered. In another example if a title is specified the title can be included in the information of a notable event that is posted as the result of the trigger condition being satisfied for the KPI correlation search.

User input can be received via a selection of a schedule type via a type button A B for executing the KPI correlation search. The type can be a Cron schedule type or a basic schedule type. For example if the basic schedule type is selected user input may be received via a button specifying that the KPI correlation search should be performed every 30 minutes. When button is activated a list of various frequencies is displayed which a user can select from. GUI can automatically be populated with the duration e.g. Last 60 minutes that is selected for example via button in .

Referring to user input can be received for assigning a severity level to an action that is performed from the KPI correlation search via a list of severity types. For example if the action is to display information in an incident review interface and the selected severity is Medium when the action is performed the severity Medium will be displayed with the information for the KPI correlation search in the incident review interface. Similarly if the action is to post a notable event and the severity selected is Medium information for the notable event will include an indication of the Medium severity when the action is performed.

In one implementation default values for schedule type and severity are displayed. The default values can be configurable. User input can be received via button for storing the definition of the KPI correlation search. The KPI correlation search definition can include the parameters that have been specified via GUI and can be stored in a structure such as structure in .

Implementations of the present disclosure are described for providing a GUI that presents notable events pertaining to one or more KPIs of one or more services. Such a notable event can be generated by a correlation search associated with a particular service. A correlation search associated with a service can include a search query a triggering determination or triggering condition and one or more actions to be performed based on the triggering determination a determination as to whether the triggering condition is satisfied . In particular a search query may include search criteria pertaining to one or more KIPs of the service and may produce data using the search criteria. For example a search query may produce KPI data for each occurrence of a KPI reaching a certain threshold over a specified period of time. A triggering condition can be applied to the data produced by the search query to determine whether the produced data satisfies the triggering condition. Using the above example the triggering condition can be applied to the produced KPI data to determine whether the number of occurrences of a KPI reaching a certain threshold over a specified period of time exceeds a value in the triggering condition. If the produced data satisfies the triggering condition a particular action can be performed. Specifically if the data produced by the search query satisfies the triggering condition a notable event can be generated.

A notable event generated by a correlation search associated with a service can represent anomalous incidents or patterns in the state s of one or more KPIs of the service. In one implementation an aggregate KPI for a service can be used by a correlation search to generate notable events. Alternatively or in addition one or more aspect KPIs of the service can be used by the correlation search to generate notable events.

As discussed above a graphical user interface is presented that allows a user to review notable events or other incidents created by the system. This interface may be referred to herein as the Incident Review interface. The Incident Review interface may allow the user to view notable events that have been created. In order to focus the user s review the interface may have controls that allow the user to filter the notable events by such criteria as severity status owner name service period of time etc. The notable events that meet the filtering criteria may be displayed in a results section of the interface. A user may select any one or more of the notable events in the result section to edit or delete the notable event view additional details of the notable event or take subsequent action on the notable event e.g. view the machine data corresponding to the notable event in a deep dive interface . Additional details of the Incident Review interface are provided below.

At block the computing machine performs a correlation search associated with a service provided by one or more entities that each have corresponding machine data. The service may include one or more key performance indicators KPIs that each indicate a state of a particular aspect of the service or a state of the service as a whole at a point in time or during a period of time. Each KPI can be derived from the machine data pertaining to the corresponding entities. Depending on the implementation the KPIs can include an aggregate KPI and or one or more aspect KPIs. A value of an aggregate KPI indicates how the service as a whole is performing at a point in time or during a period of time. A value of each aspect KPI indicates how the service in part i.e. with respect to a certain aspect of the service is performing at a point in time or during a period of time. As discussed above the correlation search associated with the service may include search criteria pertaining to the one or more KPIs i.e. an her aggregate KPI and or one or more aspect KPIs and a triggering condition to be applied to data produced by a search query using the search criteria.

At block the computing machine stores a notable event in response to the data produced by the search query satisfying the triggering condition. A notable event may represent a system occurrence that is likely to indicate a security threat or operational problem. Notable events can be detected in a number of ways 1 an analyst can notice a correlation in the data and can manually identify a corresponding group of one or more events as notable or 2 an analyst can define a correlation search specifying criteria for a notable event and every time one or more events satisfy the criteria the system can indicate that the one or more events are notable. An analyst can alternatively select a pre defined correlation search provided by the application. Note that correlation searches can be run continuously or at regular intervals e.g. every hour to search for notable events. Upon detection notable events can be stored in a dedicated notable events index which can be subsequently accessed to generate various visualizations containing security related information. As discussed above the creation of a notable event may be the resulting action taken in response to the KPI correlation search producing data that satisfies the defined triggering condition. In addition a notable event may also be created as a result of a correlation search also referred to as a trigger based search that does not rely on a KPI or the state of the KPI or of the corresponding service but rather operates on any values produced in the system being monitored and has a triggering condition and one or more actions that correspond to the triggering condition.

At block the computing machine causes display of a graphical user interface presenting information pertaining to a stored notable event. The presented information may include an identifier of the correlation search that triggered the storing of the notable event and an identifier of the service associated with the correlation search. In other implementations the graphical user interface may present additional information pertaining to the stored notable event and may receive user input to modify or take action with respect to the notable event as will be described further below.

Severity chart may visually differentiate e.g. using different colors between different severity levels and include numbers of notable events that have been categorized into different severity levels. The severity levels may include for example critical high medium low info etc. In one implementation the number corresponding to each of the severity levels in severity chart indicates the number of notable events that have been categorized into that severity level out of all notable events that meet the remaining filtering criteria in filtering controls section . During creation of a KPI correlation search a corresponding severity level may be defined such that if the data produced by the search query satisfies the triggering condition the resulting notable event will be categorized into the defined severity level. In addition different triggering conditions may be associated with different severity levels. In one implementation each severity level in severity chart may be selectable to filter the notable events displayed in results section . When one or more severity levels in severity chart are selected the notable events displayed in results section may be limited to notable events having the selected severity level s .

Status field may receive user input to filter the notable events displayed in results section by status. In one implementation status field may include a drop down menu from which the user can select one or more status values. One example of drop down menu is shown in .

Referring to the available options for filtering the status of a notable event in drop down menu may include for example all unassigned new in progress pending resolved closed or other options. During creation of a KPI correlation search a default initial status may be defined such that if the data produced by the search query satisfies the triggering condition the resulting notable event will be assigned an initial status e.g. new . In addition different initial status values may be associated with different notable events. In one implementation a notable event may be edited in GUI in order to update or modify the current status. For example if an analyst is assigned to investigate a particular notable event to determine its cause or whether additional action is needed the status of a notable event can be updated from its initial status e.g. new to a different status e.g. pending or resolved to reflect the current situation.

Referring again to name field may receive user input to filter the notable events displayed in results section by name and or title. During creation of a KPI correlation search a name and or title of the KPI correlation search may be defined such that if the data produced by the search query satisfies the triggering condition the resulting notable event will be associated with that name. When the notable event is stored one piece of associated information is the name of the correlation search from which the notable event is generated. Multiple notable events that are generated as a result of the same correlation search may then be given the same name although they may have different timestamps to allow for differentiation. Accordingly the notable events can be filtered by name in response to user input from name field .

Owner field may receive user input to filter the notable events displayed in results section by owner. In one implementation owner field may include a drop down menu from which the user can select one or more possible owners. During creation of a KPI correlation search the owner of the KPI correlation search may be defined such that if the data produced by the search query satisfies the triggering condition the resulting notable event will be associated with that owner. The owner may include for example the name of an individual who created the correlation search the name of an individual responsible for maintaining the service an organization or team of people etc. When the notable event is stored one piece of associated information is the owner of correlation search from which the notable event is generated. Multiple notable events that are generated as a result of the same correlation search or different correlation searches may then have the same owner. Accordingly the notable events can be filtered by name in response to user input from owner field .

Search field may receive user input to filter the notable events displayed in results section by keyword. When one or more search terms is input to search field those search terms may be compared against the data in each field of each stored notable event to determine if any keywords in the notable event s match the search terms. As a result the notable events displayed in results section can be filtered by keyword in response to user input from search field .

Service field may receive user input to filter the notable events displayed in results section by service. During creation of a KPI correlation search the related services of the KPI correlation search may be defined such that if the data produced by the search query satisfies the triggering condition the resulting notable event will be associated with those services. Since the KPI correlation search whether an aggregate KPI or aspect KPI indicates a state of a service at a point in time or during a period of time and derives values from corresponding machine data for the one or more entities that make up the service the service associated with the notable event generated from the KPI correlation search is known. When the notable event is stored one piece of associated information is the associated service s of the correlation search from which the notable event is generated. In one implementation other services having a dependency relationship with the KPI may also be stored as part of the notable event record. A dependency relationship may include an inbound or outbound dependency relationship i.e. an is depended on by or a depends upon relationship. Accordingly the notable events can be filtered by service in response to user input from service field .

Some implementations for causing display of a service monitoring dashboard based on the dashboard template are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The Noel gauge widget can display a label e.g. Request Response Time to describe the KPI and the metric unit e.g. ms milliseconds used for the KPI value. If the KPI value exceeds the maximum value represented by the second end of the shape of the Noel gauge widget the shape is displayed as being fully filled and can include an additional visual indicator representing that the KPI value exceeded the maximum value represented by the second end of the shape of the Noel gauge widget .

The value can be produced by executing the search query of the KPI. The execution can be real time continuous execution until interrupted or relative based on a specific request or scheduled time . In addition the machine data used by the search query to produce each value can be based on a time range. The time range can be user defined time range. For example before displaying a service monitoring dashboard generated based on the dashboard template a user can provide input specifying the time range. The input can be received for example via a drop down menu in GUI in . The initial time range received via GUI can be stored with the dashboard template in a data store and subsequently used for producing the values for the KPI to be displayed in the service monitoring dashboard.

When drop down menu is selected by a user GUI in can be displayed. illustrates an example GUI for facilitating user input specifying a time range to use when executing a search query defining a KPI in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. For real time execution for example used to update the service monitoring dashboard in real time the time range for machine data can be a specified time window e.g. 30 second window 1 minute window 1 hour window etc. from the execution time e.g. each time the query is executed the events with timestamps within the specified time window from the query execution time will be used . For relative execution the time range can be historical e.g. yesterday previous week etc. or based on a specified time window from the requested time or scheduled time e.g. last 15 minutes last 4 hours etc. . For example the historical time range Yesterday can be selected for relative execution. In another example the window time range Last 15 minutes can be selected for relative execution.

In one implementation for a service related KPI e.g. a KPI that is associated with a service interface can specify the end parameter for a search query defining the service related KPI and the service related KPI definition can specify the start parameter for the search query. For example for a particular service related KPI the range of data four hours of data can be specified by a user via a service related KPI definition GUI e.g. Monitoring portion of GUI in described above . The four hours of data that are used for the search query can be relative to an end date and time that is specified via interface .

In one implementation for an adhoc KPI i.e. a KPI that is not associated with a service interface can specify the end parameter for a search query defining the adhoc KPI and the particular type e.g. spark line single value of widget used for the adhoc KPI can specify the start parameter for the search query. In one implementation the use of a single value widget for an adhoc KPI specifies a time range of 30 minutes . In one implementation the use of a spark line widget for an adhoc KPI specifies a time range of 30 minutes . In one implementation the use of a single value delta widget also referred to as a trend indicator widget for an adhoc KPI specifies a time range of 60 minutes . The time range associated with a particular widget type can be configurable.

The interface can present a list of preset end parameters e.g. end date and or end time which a user can select from. The list can include end parameters e.g. 15 minutes ago etc. that are relative to the execution of the KPI search queries. For example if the 15 minutes ago is selected the search queries can run using data for a time range e.g. last 4 hours up until 15 minutes ago .

The interface can include a button which when selected can run the search queries for the KPIs e.g. service related KPIs adhoc KPIs in the modifiable dashboard template and update the KPIs e.g. KPI and KPI in the modifiable dashboard template in response to executing the correspond search queries.

The interface can include one or more boxes A B enabling a user to specify a particular end date and time. In one implementation when one of the boxes A B is selected an interface enabling a user to specify the particular date or time is displayed. In one implementation user input specifying the particular data and time is received via boxes A B. For example 01 07 2015 at midnight is specified. If the button is selected the search queries for KPI and KPI can be executed using four hours of data up until midnight on 01 07 2015.

When Now is selected the search query for each KPI e.g. service KPI adhoc KPI that is being represented in a service monitoring dashboard is executed using a pre defined time range and the current information for the corresponding KPI is displayed in the service monitoring dashboard. In one implementation the pre defined time range for the Now option is 2 minutes . The search queries can be executed every 2 minutes using four hours of data up until 2 minutes ago. The pre defined time range can be configurable.

When a historical preset end parameter e.g. Yesterday is selected the end parameter is relative to when the search queries for the KPI are executed for the service monitoring dashboard. For example if the search queries for the KPI are executed for the service monitoring dashboard at 1 pm today then the search queries use a corresponding range of data e.g. four hours of data up until 1 pm yesterday.

Referring to the KPI may be for Request Response Time for a Web Hosting service. The time range Last 15 minutes may be selected for the service monitoring dashboard presented to a user and the value e.g. 1.41 produced by the search query defining the Request Response Time KPI can be the average response time using the last 15 minutes of machine data associated with the entities providing the Web Hosting service from the time of the request. illustrates an example GUI illustrating a search query and a search result for a Noel gauge widget a single value widget and a trend indicator widget in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. A single value widget is discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . A trend indicator widget is discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with . Referring to the KPI may be for Request Response Time. The KPI may be defined by a search query that outputs a search result having a single value e.g. 1.41 for a Noel gauge widget a single value widget and or a trend indicator widget. The search query can include a statistical function e.g. average to produce the single value e.g. value to represent response time using machine data from the Last 15 minutes .

The machine data used by the search query to produce the value is based on a time range e.g. user selected time range . For example the KPI may be fore Request Response Time for a Web Hosting service. The time range Last 15 minutes may be selected for the service monitoring dashboard presented to a user. The value e.g. 1.41 produced by the search query defining the Request Response Time KPI can be the average response time using the last 15 minutes of machine data associated with the entities providing the Web Hosting service from the time of the request.

Another shape e.g. rectangular box in the spark line widget can include a graph e.g. line graph which is described in greater detail below that includes multiple data points. The shape e.g. rectangular box containing the graph can be colored using a color representative of the state e.g. normal warning critical of which a corresponding data point e.g. latest data point falls into. The graph can be colored using a color representative of the state e.g. normal warning critical of which a corresponding data point falls into. For example the graph may be a line graph that transitions between green yellow red depending on the value of a data point in the line graph. In one implementation input e.g. user input can be received via the service monitoring dashboard of a selection device hovering over a particular point in the line graph and information e.g. data value time and color corresponding to the particular point in the line graph can be displayed in the service monitoring dashboard for example in the spark line widget . The spark line widget can display a label to describe the KPI and the metric unit used for the KPI.

The spark line widget is showing data in a time series graph with the graph as compared to a single value widget e.g. single value widget and a Noel gauge widget e.g. Noel gauge widget that display a single data point for example as illustrated in . The data points in the graph can represent what the values produced by the search query defining the KPI have been over a time range e.g. time range selected in GUI . illustrates an example GUI illustrating a search query and search results for a spark line widget in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. The KPI may be for Request Response Time. The KPI may be defined by a search query that produces multiple values for example to be used for a spark line widget. A user may have selected a time range of Last 15 minutes e.g. time range selected in GUI . The machine data used by the search query to produce the search results can be based on the last 15 minutes. For example the search results can include a value for each minute in the last 15 minutes. The values in the search results can be used as data points to plot a graph e.g. graph in in the spark line widget. Referring to the graph is from data over a period of time e.g. Last 15 minutes . The graph is made of data points e.g. 15 values in search results in . Each data point is an aggregate from the data for a shorter period of time e.g. unit of time . For example if the time range Last 15 minutes is selected each data point in the graph represents a unit of time in the last 15 minutes. For example the unit of time may be one minute and the graph contains 15 data points one for each minute for the last 15 minutes. Each data point can be the average response time e.g. avg spent in search query in for the corresponding minute. In another example if the time range Last 4 hours is selected and the unit of time used for the graph is 15 minutes then the graph would be made from 16 data points.

In one implementation the value in the other shape e.g. box in the spark line widget represents the latest value in the time range. For example the value e.g. 1.32 can represent the last data point in the graph . If the time range Last 15 minutes is selected the value e.g. 1.32 can represent the average response time of the data in that last minute of the 15 minute time range.

In another implementation the value is the first data point in the graph . In another implementation the value represents an aggregate of the data in the graph . For example a statistical function can be performed on using the data points for the time range e.g. Last 15 minutes for the value . For example the value may be the average of all of the points in the graph the maximum value from all of the points in the graph the mean of all of the points in the graph . Input e.g. user input can be received for example via the dashboard creation graphical interface specifying type e.g. latest first average maximum mean of value to be represented by value .

When a user hovers for example a point over a point in time in the graph data that corresponds to the point in time can be displayed in a box . The data can include for example and is not limited to a value time and a state corresponding to the KPI at that point in time. In one implementation a line indicator is displayed that corresponds to the point in time.

The arrow can indicate a trend pertaining to the KPI by pointing in a direction. For example the arrow can point in a general up direction to indicate a positive or increasing trend the arrow can point in a general down direction to indicate a negative or decreasing trend or the arrow can point in a general horizontal direction to indicate no change in the KPI. The direction of the arrow in the trend indicator widget may change when a KPI is being updated for example in a service monitoring dashboard depending on the current trend at the time the KPI is being updated.

In one implementation a color is assigned to each trend e.g. increasing trend decreasing trend . The arrow can be of a nominal color or can be of a color representative of the determined trend. A user can provide input via the dashboard creation graphical interface indicating whether to apply a nominal color or color representative of the trend. The shape can be of a nominal color or can be of a color representative of the determined trend. A user can provide input via the dashboard creation graphical interface indicating whether to apply a nominal color or color representative of the trend.

In one implementation the trend represented by the arrow is of whether the value has been increasing or decreasing in a selected time range relative to the last time the KPI was calculated. For example if the time range Last 15 minutes is selected the average of the data points of the last 15 minutes is calculated and the arrow can indicate whether the average of the data points of the last 15 minutes is greater that than the average calculated from the time range e.g. 15 minutes prior. In one implementation the trend indicator widget includes a percentage indicator indicating a percentage of the value increasing or decreasing in a selected time range relative to the last time the KPI was calculated.

In another implementation the arrow indicates whether the last value for the last data point in the last 15 minutes is greater than the value immediately before the last data point.

The machine data used by the search query to produce the value is based on a time range e.g. user selected time range . For example the KPI may be fore Request Response Time for a Web Hosting service. The time range Last 15 minutes may be selected for the service monitoring dashboard presented to a user. The value e.g. 1.41 produced by the search query defining the Request Response Time KPI can be the average response time using the last 15 minutes of machine data associated with the entities providing the Web Hosting service from the time of the request.

As discussed above once the dashboard template is defined it can be saved and then used to generate a service monitoring dashboard for display. The dashboard template can identify the KPIs selected for the service monitoring dashboard KPI widgets to be displayed for the KPIs in the service monitoring dashboard locations in the service monitoring dashboard for displaying the KPI widgets visual characteristics of the KPI widgets and other information e.g. the background image for the service monitoring dashboard an initial time range for the service monitoring dashboard .

When an action is selected one or more additional GUIs can be displayed for facilitating user input pertaining to the action as described in greater detail below. For example button can be selected and an editing action can be selected to display a GUI e.g. GUI in described below for editing the Web Arch service monitoring dashboard.

GUI can display application information for each service monitoring dashboard in the list . The application information can indicate an application that is used for creating and or editing the particular service monitoring dashboard. GUI can display owner information for each service monitoring dashboard in the list . The owner information can indicate a role that is assigned to the owner of the particular service monitoring dashboard.

GUI can display permission information for each service monitoring dashboard in the list . The permission information can indicate a permission level e.g. application level private level . An application level permission level allows any user that is authorized to access to the service monitoring dashboard creation and or editing GUIs permission to access and edit the particular service monitoring dashboard. A private level permission level allows a single user e.g. owner creator permission to access and edit the particular service monitoring dashboard. In one implementation a permission level include permissions by role. In one implementation one or more specific users can be specified for one or more particular levels.

GUI can include a button which when selected can display GUI in for specifying information for a new service monitoring dashboard.

A KPI that is being represented by a widget in the modifiable dashboard template can be a service related KPI or an adhoc KPI. A service related KPI is a KPI that is related to one or more services and or one or more entities. A service related KPI can be defined using service monitoring GUIs as described in above in conjunction with . An ad hoc KPI is a key performance indicator that is not related to any service or entity. For example service related KPI named Web performance is represented by Noel gauge widget . The Web performance can be a KPI that is related to Splunk Service .

The configuration interface can display data that pertains to a KPI e.g. service related KPI adhoc KPI that is selected in the modifiable dashboard template . For example an adhoc KPI can be defined via GUI . For example an adhoc search button can be activated and a location e.g. location can be selected in the modifiable dashboard template . A widget for the adhoc KPI can be displayed at the selected location . In one implementation a default widget e.g. single value widget is displayed for the adhoc KPI.

The configuration interface can display data that pertains to the adhoc KPI. For example configuration interface can display source information for the adhoc KPI. The source information can indicate whether the adhoc KPI is derived from an adhoc search or data model. An adhoc KPI can be defined by a search query. The search query can be derived from a data model or an adhoc search query. An adhoc search query is a user defined search query.

In one implementation when the adhoc search button is activated for creating an adhoc KPI the adhoc KPI is derived from an adhoc search query by default and the adhoc type button is displayed as enabled. The adhoc type button can also be user selected to indicate that the adhoc KPI is to be derived from an adhoc search query.

When the adhoc type button is enabled a text box can be displayed for the search language defining the adhoc search query. In one implementation the text box is populated with the search language for a default adhoc search query. In one implementation the default adhoc search query is a count of events and the search language index internal  timechart count is displayed in the text box . A user can edit the search language via the text box to change the adhoc search query.

When the data model type button is selected the configuration interface can display an interface for using a data model to define the adhoc KPI is displayed. illustrates an example interface for using a data model to define an adhoc KPI in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. If button is selected a GUI is displayed that enables a user to specify a data model an object of the data model and a field of the object for defining the adhoc KPI. If button is selected a GUI is displayed that enables a user to select a statistical function e.g. count distinct count to calculate a statistic using the value s from the field.

Referring to one or more types of KPI widgets can support the configuration of thresholds for the adhoc KPI. For example a Noel gauge widget a spark line widget and a trend indicator widget also referred to as a single value delta widget throughout this document can support setting one or more thresholds for the adhoc KPI. For example if the Noel gauge button is activated the configuration interface can display an interface for setting one or more thresholds for the adhoc KPI.

Referring to if the update button e.g. update button in is activated the widget can be updated to display a Noel gauge widget. If the adhoc KPI is being defined using a data model the configuration interface can display the user selected settings for the adhoc KPI that have been specified for example using GUI in .

Referring to if a service related KPI widget is selected in the modifiable dashboard template the configuration interface can display information pertaining to the service related KPI. For example the Noel gauge widget can be selected and the configuration interface can display information pertaining to the Web performance KPI that is related to the Splunk Service .

Referring to if the run search link is activated a search GUI that displays information e.g. search language search result set for a KPI e.g. service KPI adhoc KPI that is selected in the modifiable dashboard template .

One or more items can be overlaid with each other. The layers that correspond to the overlaid items can form a stack of layers in the modifiable dashboard template . For example items A H form a stack of layers.

A current layer for an item can be relative to the other layers in the stack. The configuration interface can include layering buttons A D for changing the layer for an item that is selected in the modifiable dashboard template . A layering button can change the layer order one layer at a time for an item. For example there can be a Bring Forward button C to bring a selected item one layer forward and there can be a Send Backward button D to send a selected item one layer backward. A layering button can change the layer order more than one layer at a time. For example there can be a Bring to Front button A to bring a selected item to the most forward layer and there can be a Send to Back button B to send a selected item to the most backward layer. For example item F can be selected and the Send to Back button B can be activated. In response to activating the Send to Back button B the items F can be displayed in the most backward layer in the stack. illustrates an example GUI for editing layers for items in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. Item is displayed in the most backward layer in a stack defined by selected items.

GUI can include a panning button to enable panning mode for the modifiable dashboard template . When panning mode is enabled the items in the modifiable dashboard template can be moved within the modifiable dashboard template using a panning function. In one implementation the modifiable dashboard template is processed as having an infinite size.

GUI can include an image button which when selected can display a GUI for selecting one or more images to import into the modifiable dashboard template . For example image has been imported into the modifiable dashboard template . When an image is selected in the modifiable dashboard template the image can be resized based on user interaction with the image. For example a user can select an image click a corner of the image and drag the image to resize the image.

The configuration interface can include a lock position button for locking one or more selected items in a position in the modifiable dashboard template . In one implementation when an auto layout button is activated an item that has a locked position is not affected by the auto layout function.

When the auto layout button is activated the modifiable dashboard template automatically displays the unlocked widgets e.g. service related KPI widgets adhoc KPI widgets in a serial order in the modifiable dashboard template . In one implementation the order is based when the widgets were added to the modifiable dashboard template . In one implementation the order is based on the layers that correspond to the widgets. In one implementation when a layer is changes for a widget the order uses the current layer. In one implementation the order is based on the last KPI state that is associated with the particular widget. In one implementation the order is based on any combination of the above.

In one implementation the modifiable dashboard template automatically displays one or more items e.g. widget line text image shape connector etc. in a serial order in the modifiable dashboard template . In one implementation the order is based when the items were added to the modifiable dashboard template . In one implementation the order is based on the layers that correspond to the items. In one implementation when a layer is changes for an item the order uses the current layer. In one implementation the order is based on the type e.g. widget line text image shape connector etc. of item. In one implementation the order is based on any combination of the above.

The direction of the arrow can correspond to the selection of the first item and the second item . The type of connector e.g. single arrow double arrow and no arrow and the direction of the connector can be edited based on user input received via the modifiable dashboard template . In one implementation when one of the connected items e.g. first item second item is moved in the modifiable dashboard template the connector moves accordingly.

When a connector is selected the configuration interface can display text boxes and or lists for editing the connector. For example the color stroke width stoke type e.g. solid line dashed line etc. and label of a connector can be edited via user input received via the text boxes and or lists. For example the configuration interface can display a list of colors which a user can select from and apply to the connector.

GUI can include buttons for adding shape s to the modifiable dashboard template . For example when button is activated a rectangular type of shape can be added to the modifiable dashboard template . When button is activated an elliptical type of shape can be added to the modifiable dashboard template . When a shape e.g. square is selected the configuration interface can display text boxes and or lists for editing the shape. For example the fill color fill pattern border color border width and border type e.g. solid line dashed line double line etc. of a shape can be edited via user input received via the text boxes and or lists.

GUI can include a button for adding line s to the modifiable dashboard template . For example when button is activated a line can be added to the modifiable dashboard template . When a line is selected the configuration interface can display text boxes and or lists for editing the line. For example the fill color fill pattern border color border width and line type e.g. solid line dashed line double line etc. of a line can be edited via user input received via the text boxes and or lists.

At block the computing machine identifies one or more key performance indicators KPIs for one or more services to be monitored via a service monitoring dashboard. A service can be provided by one or more entities. Each entity can be associated with machine data. The machine data can include unstructured data log data and or wire data. The machine data associated with an entity can include data collected from an API for software that monitors that entity.

A KPI can be defined by a search query that derives one or more values from machine data associated with the one or more entities that provide the service. Each KPI can be defined by a search query that is either entered by a user or generated through a graphical interface. In one implementation the computing machine accesses a dashboard template that is stored in a data store that includes information identifying the KPIs to be displayed in the service monitoring dashboard. In one implementation the dashboard template specifies a service definition that associates the service with the entities providing the service specifies the KPIs of the service and also specifies the search queries for the KPIs. As discussed above the search query defining a KPI can derive one or more values for the KPI using a late binding schema that it applies to machine data. In some implementations the service definition identified by the dashboard template can also include information on predefined states for a KPI and various visual indicators that should be used to illustrate states of the KPI in the dashboard.

The computing machine can optionally receive input e.g. user input identifying one or more ad hoc searches to be monitored via the service monitoring dashboard without selecting services or KPIs.

At block the computing machine identifies a time range. The time range can be a default time range or a time range specified in the dashboard template. The machine data can be represented as events. The time range can be used to indicate which events to use for the search queries for the identified KPIs.

At block for each KPI the computing machine identifies a KPI widget style to represent the respective KPI. In one implementation the computing machine accesses the dashboard template that includes information identifying the KPI widget style to use for each KPI. As discussed above examples of KPI widget styles can include a Noel gauge widget style a single value widget style a spark line widget style and a trend indicator widget style. The computing machine can also obtain from the dashboard template additional visual characteristics for each KPI widget such as the name of the widget the metric unit of the KPI value settings for using nominal colors or colors to represent states and or trends the type of value to be represented in KPI widget e.g. the type of value to be represented by value in a spark line widget etc.

The KPIs widget styles can display data differently for representing a respective KPI. The computing machine can produce a set of values and or a value depending on the KPI widget style for a respective KPI. If the KPI widget style represents the respective KPI using values for multiple points in time in the time range method proceeds to block . Alternatively if the KPI widget style represents the respective KPI using a single value during the time range method proceeds to block .

At block if the KPI widget style represents the respective KPI using a single value the computing machine causes a value to be produced from a set of machine data or events whose timestamps are within the time range. The value may be a statistic calculated based on one or more values extracted from a specific field in the set of machine data or events when the search query is executed. The statistic may be an average of the extracted values a mean of the extracted values a maximum of the extracted values a last value of the extracted values etc. A single value widget style a Noel gauge widget style and trend indicator widget style can represent a KPI using a single value.

The search query that defines a respective KPI may produce a single value which a KPI widget style can use. The computing machine can cause the search query to be executed to produce the value. The computing machine can send the search query to an event processing system. As discussed above machine data can be represented as events. The machine data used to derive the one or more KPI values can be identifiable on a per entity basis by referencing entity definitions that are aggregated into a service definition corresponding to the service whose performance is reflected by the KPI.

The event processing system can access events with time stamps falling within the time period specified by the time range identify which of those events should be used e.g. from the one or more entity definitions in the service definition for the service whose performance is reflected by the KPI produce the result e.g. single value using the identified events and send the result to the computing machine. The computing machine can receive the result and store the result in a data store.

At block if the KPI widget style represents the respective KPI using a set of values the computing machine causes a set of values for multiple points in time in the time range to be produced. A spark line widget style can represent a KPI using a set of values. Each value in the set of values can represent an aggregate of data in a unit of time in the time range. For example if the time range is Last 15 minutes and the unit of time is one minute then each value in the set of values is an aggregate of the data in one minute in the last 15 minutes.

If the search query that defines a respective KPI produces a single value instead of a set of multiple values as required by the KPI widget style e.g. for the graph of the spark line widget the computing machine can modify the search query to produce the set of values e.g. for the graph of the spark line widget . The computing machine can cause the search query or modified search query to be executed to produce the set of values. The computing machine can send the search query or modified search query to an event processing system. The event processing system can access events with time stamps falling within the time period specified by the time range identify which of those events should be used produce the results e.g. set of values using the identified events and send the results to the computing machine. The computing machine can store the results in a data store.

At block for each KPI the computing machine generates the KPI widget using the KPI widget style and the value or set of values produced for the respective KPI. For example if a KPI is being represented by a spark line widget style the computing machine generates the spark line widget using a set of values produced for the KPI to populate the graph in the spark line widget. The computing machine also generates the value e.g. value in spark line widget in for the spark line widget based on the dashboard template. The dashboard template can store the selection of the type of value that is to be represented in a spark line widget. For example the value may represent the first data point in the graph the last data point the graph an average of all of the points in the graph the maximum value from all of the points in the graph or the mean of all of the points in the graph.

In addition in some implementations the computing machine can obtain KPI state information e.g. from the service definition specifying KPI states a range of values for each state and a visual characteristic e.g. color associated with each state. The computing machine can then determine the current state of each KPI using the value or set of values produced for the respective KPI and the state information of the respective KPI. Based on the current state of the KPI a specific visual characteristic e.g. color can be used for displaying the KPI widget of the KPI as discussed in more detail above.

At block the computing machine generates a service monitoring dashboard with the KPI widgets for the KPIs using the dashboard template and the KPI values produced by the respective search queries. In one implementation the computing machine accesses a dashboard template that is stored in a data store that includes information identifying the KPIs to be displayed in the service monitoring dashboard. As discussed above the dashboard template defines locations for placing the KPI widgets and can also specify a background image over which the KPI widgets can be placed.

At block the computing machine causes display of the service monitoring dashboard with the KPI widgets for the KPIs. Each KPI widget provides a numerical and or graphical representation of one or more values for a corresponding KPI. Each KPI widget indicates how an aspect of the service is performing at one or more points in time. For example each KPI widget can display a current KPI value and indicate the current state of the KPI using a visual characteristic associated with the current state. In one implementation the service monitoring dashboard is displayed in a viewing investigation mode based on a user selection to view the service monitoring dashboard is displayed in the viewing investigation mode.

At block the computing machine optionally receives a request for detailed information for one or more KPIs in the service monitoring dashboard. The request can be received for example from a selection e.g. user selection of one or more KPI widgets in the service monitoring dashboard.

At block the computing machine causes display of the detailed information for the one or more KPIs. In one implementation the computing machine causes the display of a deep dive visual interface which includes detailed information for the one or more KPIs. A deep dive visual interface is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The service monitoring dashboard may allow a user to change a time range. In response the computing machine can send the search query and the new time range to an event processing system. The event processing system can access events with time stamps falling within the time period specified by the new time range identify which of those events should be used produce the result e.g. one or more values using the identified events and send the result to the computing machine. The computing machine can then cause the service monitoring dashboard to be updated with new values and modified visual representations of the KPI widgets.

Each service is provided by one or more entities. Each entity is associated with machine data. The machine data can include for example and is not limited to unstructured data log data and wire data. The machine data that is associated with an entity can include data collected from an API for software that monitors that entity. The machine data used to derive the one or more values represented by a KPI is identifiable on a per entity basis by referencing entity definitions that are aggregated into a service definition corresponding to the service whose performance is reflected by the KPI.

Each KPI is defined by a search query that derives the one or more values represented by the corresponding KPI widget from the machine data associated with the one or more entities that provide the service whose performance is reflected by the KPI. The search query for a KPI can derive the one or more values for the KPI it defines using a late binding schema that it applies to machine data.

In one implementation the GUI includes one or more search result widgets e.g. widget displaying a value produced by a respective search query as specified by the dashboard template. For example widget may represent the results of a search query producing a stats count for a particular entity.

In one implementation GUI facilitates user input for displaying detailed information for one or more KPIs. A user can select one or more KPI widgets to request detailed information for the KPIs represented by the selected KPI widgets. The detailed information for each selected KPI can include values for points in time during the period of time. The detailed information can be displayed via one or more deep dive visual interfaces. A deep dive visual interface is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Referring to GUI facilitates user input for changing a time range. The machine data used by a search query to produce a value for a KPI is based on a time range. As described above in conjunction with the time range can be a user defined time range. For example if the time range Last 15 minutes is selected the last 15 minutes would be an aggregation period for producing the value. GUI can be updated with one or more KPI widgets that each represent one or more values for a corresponding KPI indicating how a service provided is performing at one or more points in time based on the change to the time range.

GUI can display the items e.g. service related KPI widgets adhoc KPI widgets images connectors text shapes line etc. as specified using the KPI selection interface modifiable dashboard template configuration interface and customization tool bar.

In one implementation one or more widgets e.g. service related KPI widgets adhoc KPI widgets that are presented in view mode can be selected by a user to display one or more GUIs presenting more detailed information for example in a deep dive visualization as described in greater detail below.

For example a service related KPI widget for a particular KPI can be displayed in view mode. When the service related KPI widget is selected a deep dive visualization can be displayed that presents data pertaining to the service related KPI. The service related KPI is related to a particular service and one or more other services based on dependency. The data that is presented in the deep dive visualization can include data for all of the KPIs that are related to the particular service and or all of the KPIs from one or more dependent services.

When an adhoc KPI widget is displayed in view mode and is selected a deep dive visualization can be displayed that presents data pertaining to the adhoc search for the adhoc KPI.

GUI can include a button for displaying an interface e.g. interface in for specifying an end date and time for a time range to use when executing a search query defining a KPI displayed in GUI .

At block the computing machine receives a request to display a service monitoring page also referred to herein as a service monitoring home page or simply as a home page . In one implementation the service monitoring page includes visual representations of the health of a system that can be easily viewed by a user e.g. a system administrator with a quick glance. The system may include one or more services. The performance of each service can be monitored using an aggregate KPI characterizing the respective service as a whole. In addition various aspects e.g. CPU usage memory usage response time etc. of a particular service can be monitored using respective aspect KPIs typifying performance of individual aspects of the service. For example a service may have 10 separate aspect KPIs each monitoring a various aspect of the service.

As discussed above each KPI is associated with a service provided by one or more entities and each KPI is defined by a search query that produces a value derived from machine data pertaining to the one or more entities. A value of each aggregate KPI indicates how the service in whole is performing at a point in time or during a period of time. A value of each aspect KPI indicates how the service in part with respect to a certain aspect of the service is performing at a point in time or during a period of time.

At block the computing machine can determine data associated with one or more aggregate KPI definitions and one or more aspect KPI definitions useful for creating the home page GUI. In an implementation determining the data can include referencing service definitions in a data store and or referencing KPI definitions is a data store and or referencing stored KPI values and or executing search queries to produce KPI values. In an implementation determining the data can include determining KPI related information for each of a set of aggregate KPI definitions and for each of a set of aspect KPI definitions. The KPI related information for each aggregate or aspect KPI definition may include a KPI state. At block the computing machine may determine an order for both the set of aggregate KPI definitions and the set of aspect KPI definitions. Information related to the KPI definition may vicariously represent the KPI definition in the ordering process such that if the information related to the KPI definition is ordered with respect to the information related to other KPI definitions the KPI definition is considered equivalently ordered by implication. Many criteria are possible on which to base the ordering of a set of KPI definitions including for example the most recently produced KPI value or the most recently indicated KPI state.

At block the computing machine causes display of the requested service monitoring page having a services summary region and a services aspects region. The service summary region contains an ordered plurality of interactive summary tiles. In one implementation each summary tile corresponds to a respective service and provides a character or graphical representation of at least one value for an aggregate KPI characterizing the respective service as a whole. The services aspects region contains an ordered plurality of interactive aspect tiles. In one implementation each aspect tile corresponds to a respective aspect KPI and provides a character or graphical representation of one or more values for the respective aspect KPI. Each aspect KPI may have an associated service and may typify performance for an aspect of the associated service.

The requested service monitoring page may also include a notable events region presenting an indication of one or more correlation searches that generate the highest number of notable events in a given period of time. In one implementation the notable events region includes the indication of each correlation search a value representing the number of notable events generated in response to execution of each correlation search and a graphical representation of the number of notable events generated over the given period of time.

In one implementation the computing machine is a client device that causes display of the requested service monitoring page by receiving a service monitoring web page or a service monitoring UI document from a server and rendering the service monitoring web page using a web browser on the client device or rendering the service monitoring UI document using a mobile application app on the client device. Alternatively the computing machine is a server computer that causes display of the requested service monitoring page by creating a service monitoring web page or a service monitoring UI document and providing it to a client device for display via a web browser or a mobile application app on the client device.

In one implementation creating a service monitoring web page or a service monitoring UI document includes determining the current and past values of the aggregate and aspect KPIs determining the states of the aggregate and aspect KPIs and identifying the most critical aggregate and aspect KPIs. In one implementation various aspects e.g. CPU usage memory usage response time etc. of a particular service can be monitored using a search query defined for an aspect KPI which is executed against raw machine data from entities that make up the service. The values from the raw machine data that are returned as a result of the defined search query represent the values of the aspect KPI. An aggregate KPI can be configured and calculated for a service to represent an overall summary of a service. The overall summary of a service in an embodiment may convey the health of the service i.e. its sufficiency for meeting or satisfaction of operational objectives. In one example a service may have multiple separate aspect KPIs. The separate aspect KPIs for a service can be combined e.g. averaged weighted averaged etc. to create an aggregate KPI whose value is representative of the overall performance of the service. In one implementation various thresholds can be defined for either aggregate KPIs or aspect KPIs. The defined thresholds correspond to ranges of values that represent the various states of the service. The values of the aggregate KPIs and or aspect KPIs can be compared to the corresponding thresholds to determine the state of the aggregate or aspect KPI. The various states have an ordered severity that can be used to determine which KPIs should be displayed in service monitoring page. In one implementation the states include critical high medium normal and low in order from most severe to least severe. In one implementation some number of aggregate and aspect KPIs that have the highest severity level according to their determined state may be displayed in the corresponding region of the service monitoring page. Additional details of thresholding state determination and severity are described above with respect to .

At block the computing machine performs monitoring related to the homepage. Such monitoring may include receiving notification of an operating system event such as a timer pop or receiving notification of a GUI event such as a user input. Blocks through each signify a determination as to whether a particular monitored event has occurred and the processing that should result if it has. In one embodiment each of blocks may be associated with the execution of an event handler. At block a determination is made whether notification has been received indicating that dynamic update or refresh of the homepage should occur. The notification may ensue from a user clicking a refresh button of the GUI or from the expiration of a refresh interval timer established for the homepage for example. If so processing returns to block in one embodiment. At block a determination is made whether notification has been received indicating that a display mode for the homepage should be changed. The notification may ensue from a user clicking a display mode button of the GUI such as one selecting a network operations center display mode over a standard display mode for example. If so processing returns to block where the homepage is caused to be displayed in accordance presumably with the user input. At block a determination is made whether notification has been received indicating some other user interaction or input. If so processing proceeds to block where an appropriate response to the user input is executed.

In one implementation the visual representations in services summary region contain an ordered plurality of interactive summary tiles . Each of interactive summary tiles corresponds to a respective service in the system e.g. Activesync Outlook Outlook RPC and provides a character or graphical representation of at least one value for an aggregate KPI characterizing the respective service as a whole. In one implementation each of interactive summary tiles includes an indication of the corresponding service i.e. the name or other identifier of the service a numerical value indicating the aggregate KPI and a sparkline indicating how the value of the aggregate KPI has changed over time. In one implementation each of interactive summary tiles has a background color indicative of the state of the service. The state of the service may be determined by comparing the aggregate KPI of the service to one or more defined thresholds as described above. In addition each of interactive summary tiles may include a numerical value representing the state of the aggregate KPI characterizing the service and or a textual indication of the state of the aggregate KPI e.g. the name of the current state . In one implementation only a certain number of interactive summary tiles may be displayed in services summary region at one time. For example some number e.g. 15 20 etc. of the most critical services as measured by the severity of the states of their aggregate KPIs may be displayed. In another implementation tiles for user selected services may be displayed i.e. the most important services to the user . In one implementation which services are displayed as well as the number of services displayed may be configured by the user through menu element .

The interactive summary tiles of service monitoring page are depicted as rectangular tiles arranged in an orthogonal array within a region without appreciable interstices. Another implementation may include tiles that are not rectangular or arranged in a pattern that is not an orthogonal array or that has interstitial spaces grout between tiles or some combination. Another implementation may include tiles having no background color such that a tile has no clearly visible delineated shape or boundary. Another implementation may include tiles of more than one size. These and other implementations are possible.

In one implementation services summary region further includes a health bar gage . The health bar gage may indicate distribution of aggregate KPIs of all services across each of the various states rather than just the most critical services. The length of a portion of the health bar gage which is colored according to a specific KPI state depends on the number of services with aggregate KPIs in that state. In addition the health bar gage may have numeric indications of the number of services with KPIs in each state as well as the total number of services in the system being monitored.

In one implementation the visual representations in services aspects region contain an ordered plurality of interactive aspect tiles . Each of interactive aspect tiles corresponds to a respective aspect KPI and provides a character or graphical representation of one or more values for the respective aspect KPI. Each aspect KPI may have an associated service and may typify performance for an aspect of the associated service. In one implementation each of interactive aspect tiles includes an indication of the corresponding aspect KPI i.e. the name or other identifier of the aspect KPI an indication of the service with which the aspect KPI is associated a numerical value indicating the current value of the aspect KPI and a sparkline indicating how the value of the aspect KPI has changed over time. In one implementation each of interactive aspect tiles has a background color indicative of the state of the aspect KPI. The state of the aspect KPI may be determined by comparing the aspect KPI to one or more defined thresholds as described above. In addition each of interactive aspect tiles may include a numerical value representing the state of the aspect KPI and or a textual indication of the state of the aspect KPI e.g. the name of the current state . In one implementation only a certain number of interactive aspect tiles may be displayed in services aspects region at one time. For example some number e.g. 15 20 etc. of the most critical aspect KPIs as measured by the severity of the states of the KPIs may be displayed. In another implementation tiles for user selected aspect KPIs may be displayed i.e. the most important KPIs to the user . In one implementation which aspect KPIs are displayed as well as the number of aspect KPIs displayed may be configured by the user through menu element .

In one implementation services aspects region further includes an aspects bar gage . The aspects bar gage may indicate the distribution of all aspect KPIs across each of the various states rather than just the most critical KPIs. The length of a portion of the aspects bar gage that is colored according to a specific state depends on the number of aspect KPIs in that state. In addition the aspects bar gage may have numeric indications of the number of aspect KPIs in each state as well as the total number of aspect KPIs in the system being monitored.

The tiles of a region e.g. of of each occupy an ordered position within the region. In one embodiment the order of region tiles proceeds from left to right then top to bottom with the first tile located in the leftmost topmost position. In one embodiment the order of region tiles proceeds from top to bottom then left to right. In one embodiment the order of region tiles proceeds from right to left then top to bottom. In one embodiment different regions may have different ordering arrangements. Other ordering is possible. A direct use of the ordered positions of tiles within a region is for making the association between a particular KPI definition and the particular tile for displaying information related to it. For example a set of aspect KPI definitions with a determined order such as discussed in relation to block of can be mapped in order to the successively ordered tiles of an aspects region .

In one embodiment service monitoring page includes a display mode selection GUI element enabling a user to indicate a selection of a display mode. In one embodiment display mode selection element enables the user to select between a network operations center NOC display mode and a home display mode. In one embodiment tiles displaying KPI related information while in NOC mode are larger occupy more relative display area than corresponding tiles displayed while in home mode. In an embodiment display area is acquired to accommodate the larger tiles by a combination of one or more of reducing the total tile count reducing or eliminating interstitial space between tiles or between displayed elements of the GUI generally reducing or eliminating GUI elements such as any auxiliary regions area or other methods. The transformation of the GUI display from home to NOC mode changes the size of tiles relative to one or more other GUI elements and so is not a simple zoom function applied to the service monitoring page . In one embodiment an indicator within a tile displaying KPI related information while in NOC mode is larger occupies more relative display area than the corresponding indicator displayed while in home mode. For example a character type indicator within a tile may display using a larger or bolder font while in NOC mode than while in home mode. In one embodiment display area is acquired to accommodate the larger indicator by a combination of reducing or eliminating other indicators appearing within the tile. Embodiments with more than two display mode selection options such as associated with GUI element are possible.

In one implementation the notable events region includes the indication e.g. the name of each correlation search a value representing the number of notable events generated in response to execution of each correlation search and a graphical representation e.g. a sparkline of the number of notable events generated over the given period of time . In one implementation the correlation searches shown in notable events region may be sorted according to the data in each of columns and .

In one implementation only a certain number of correlation searches may be displayed in notable events region at one time. For example some number e.g. 5 10 etc. of the correlation searches that generate the most notable events in a given period of time may be displayed. In another implementation all correlation searches that generated a minimum number of notable events in a given period of time may be displayed. In one implementation which correlation searches are displayed as well as the number of correlation searches displayed may be configured by the user.

In an embodiment notable events region may be replaced by or supplemented with one or more other information regions. For example one embodiment of an other information region may display most recently used items such as most recently viewed service monitoring dashboards or most recently used deep dive displays. Each most recently used item may contain the item name or some other identifier for the item. Any notable event regions and other information regions in a GUI display may be collectively referred to as auxiliary regions. In one embodiment items displayed in auxiliary regions support user interaction. User interaction may for example provide an indication to the computing machine of a user s desire to navigate to a GUI component related to the item with which the user interacted. For example a user may click on a notable event name in the notable event region to navigate to a GUI displaying detailed information about the event. For example a user may click on the name of a most recently viewed service monitoring dashboard in an other information region to navigate to the dashboard GUI. In one embodiment auxiliary regions are displayed together in an auxiliary regions area. An auxiliary regions area may be located in a GUI display as described above for the notable events region .

In response to one or more of interactive aspect tiles being selected menu elements and may be displayed in service monitoring page . Menu element may be used to cancel the selection of any interactive aspects tiles in services aspects region . Activation of menu element may cause the selected tiles to be unselected and revert to the non selected state as shown in . Menu element may be used to view the selected aspect KPIs in a deep dive visual interface which includes detailed information for the one or more selected aspect KPIs. The deep dive visual interface displays time based graphical visualizations corresponding to the selected aspect KPIs to allow a user to visually correlate the aspect KPIs over a defined period of time. A deep dive visual interface is described in greater detail below in conjunction with .

Implementations of the present disclosure provide a GUI that provides in depth information about multiple KPIs of the same service or different services. This GUI referred to herein as a deep dive displays time based graphical visualizations corresponding to the multiple KPIs to allow a user to visually correlate the KPIs over a defined period of time.

At block the computing machine receives a selection of KPIs that each indicates a different aspect of how a service e.g. a web hosting service an email service a database service provided by one or more entities e.g. host machines virtual machines switches firewalls routers sensors etc. is performing. As discussed above each of these entities produces machine data or has its operation reflected in machine data not produced by that entity e.g. machine data collected from an API for software that monitors that entity while running on another entity . Each KPI is defined by a different search query that derives one or more values from the machine data pertaining to the entities providing the service. Each of the derived values is associated with a point in time and represents the aspect of how the service is performing at the associated point in time. In one implementation the KPIs are selected by a user using GUIs described below in connection with .

At block the computing machine derives the value s for each of the selected KPIs from the machine data pertaining to the entities providing the service. In one implementation the computing machine executes a search query of a respective KPI to derive the value s for that KPI from the machine data.

At block the computing machine causes display of a graphical visualization of the derived KPI values along a time based graph lane for each of the selected KPIs. In one implementation the graph lanes for the selected KPIs are parallel to each other and the graphical visualizations in the graph lanes are all calibrated to the same time scale. In one implementation the graphical visualizations are displayed in the visual interfaces described below in connection with .

At block the computing machine receives a request to create a graph for a KPI. Depending on the implementation the request can be made by a user from service monitoring dashboard GUI or from a GUI for creating a visual interface as described below with respect to . At block the computing machine displays the available services that are being monitored and at block receives a selection of one of the available services. At block the computing machine displays the KPIs associated with the selected service and at block receives a selection of one of the associated KPIs. In one implementation the KPIs are selected by a user using GUIs described below in connection with . At block the computing machine uses a service definition of the selected service to identify a search query corresponding to the selected KPI. At block the computing machine determines if there are more KPI graphs to create. If the user desires to create additional graphs the method returns to block and repeats the operations of blocks for each additional graph.

If there are no more KPI graphs to create at block the computing machine identifies a time range. The time range can be defined based on a user input which can include e.g. identification of a relative time or absolute time perhaps entered through user interface controls. The time range can include a portion or all of a time period where the time period corresponds to one used to indicate which values of the KPI to retrieve from a data store. In one implementation the time range is selected by a user using GUIs described below in connection with . At block the computing device creates a time axis reflecting the identified time range. The time axis may run parallel to at least one graph lane in the create visual interface and may include an indication of the amount of time represented by a time scale for the visual interface e.g. Viewport 1 h 1 m indicating that the graphical visualizations in the graph lanes display KPI values for a time range of one hour and one minute .

At block the computing device executes the search query corresponding to each KPI and stores the resulting KPI dataset values for the selected time range. At block the computing device determines the maximum and minimum values of the KPI for the selected time range and at block creates a graph lane in the visual interface for each KPI using the maximum and minimum values as the height of the lane. In one implementation a vertical scale for each lane may be automatically selected using the maximum and minimum KPI values during the current time range such that the maximum value appears at or near the top of the lane and the minimum value appears at or near the bottom of the lane. The intermediate values between the maximum and minimum may be scaled accordingly.

At block the computing device creates a graphical visualization for each lane using the KPI values during the selected time period and selected visual characteristics. In one implementation the KPI values are plotted over the time range in a time based graph lane. The graphical visualization may be generated according to an identified graph type and graph color as well as any other identified visual characteristics. At block the computing device calibrates the graphical visualizations to a same time scale such that the graphical visualization in each lane of the visual interface represents KPI data over the same period of time.

Blocks can be repeated for a new time range. Such repetition can occur e.g. after detecting an input corresponding to an identification of a new time range. The generation of a new graphical visualization can include modification of an existing graphical visualization.

In one example GUI can receive user input for a number of input fields selections from drop down menus and or selection of selection buttons or link . For example input field can receive a title for the graphical visualization being added. Input field may receive a subtitle or description of the graphical visualization. The input to input fields and may be optional in one implementation such that it is not absolutely required for addition of the graphical visualization. Input to fields and may be helpful however in identifying the graphical visualization once it is added to the visual interface. In one implementation if a title is not received in input fields or the computing machine may assign a default title to the graphical visualization being added.

Drop down menu can be used to receive a selection of a graph style and drop down menu can be used to receive a selection of a graph color for the graphical visualization being added. Additional details with respect to selection of the graph style and the graph color for the graphical visualization are described below in connection with .

Selection buttons may receive input pertaining to a search source for the graphical visualization being added. In one implementation the user may select search source of Ad Hoc Data Model or KPI. Additional details with respect to selection of the search source for the graphical visualization are described below in connection with . Input field may receive a user input search query or display a search query associated with the selected search source . Selection of link may indicate that the user wants to execute the search query in input field . When a search query is executed the search query can produce one or more values that satisfy the search criteria for the search query. Upon the entering of data and the selection menu items the selection of button may initiate the addition of the graphical visualization to the visual interface.

The graphical visualizations in each lane can all be calibrated to the same time scale. That is each graphical visualization corresponds to a different KPI reflecting how a service is performing over a given time range. The time range can be reflected by a time axis for the graphical visualizations that runs parallel to at least one graph lane. The time axis may include an indication of the amount of time represented by the time scale e.g. Viewport 1 h 1 m indicating that the graphical visualizations in graph lanes display KPI values for a time range of one hour and one minute and an indication of the actual time of day represented by the time scale e.g. 12 30 12 45 01 PM . In one implementation a bar running parallel to the time lanes including the indication of the amount of time represented by the time scale e.g. Viewport 1 h 1 m is highlighted for an entire length of time axis to indicate that the current portion of the time range being viewed includes the entire time range. In other implementations when only a subset of the time range is being viewed the bar may be highlighted for a proportional subset of the length of time axis and only in a location along time axis corresponding to the subset. In one implementation at least a portion of the time axis is displayed both above and below the graph lanes . In one implementation an indicator associated with drop down menu also indicates the selected time range e.g. Last 60 minutes for the graphical visualizations.

In one implementation when one of graph lanes is selected e.g. by hovering the cursor over the lane a grab handle is displayed in association with the selected lane . When user interaction with grab handle is detected e.g. by click and hold of a mouse button the graph lanes may be re ordered in visual interface . For example a user may use grab handle to move lane to a different location in visual interface with respect to the other lanes such as between lanes and or below lanes and . When another lane is selected a corresponding grab handle may be displayed for the selected lane and used to detect an interaction of a user indicative of an instruction to re order the graph lanes. In one implementation a grab handle is only displayed when the corresponding lane is selected and hidden from view when the lane is not selected.

While the horizontal axis of each lane is scaled according to the selected time range and may be the same for each of the lanes a scale for the vertical axis of each lane may be determined individually. In one implementation a scale for the vertical axis of each lane may be automatically selected such that the graphical visualization spans most or all of a width height of the lane. In one implementation the scale may be determined using the maximum and minimum values reflected by the graphical visualization for the corresponding KPI during the current time range such that the maximum value appears at or near the top of the lane and the minimum value appears at or near the bottom of the lane. The intermediate values between the maximum and minimum may be scaled accordingly. In one implementation a search query associated with the KPI is executed for a selected period of time. The results of the query return a dataset of KPI values as shown in . The maximum and minimum values from this dataset can be determined and used to scale the graphical visualization so that most or all of the lane is utilized to display the graphical visualization.

In one implementation visual indicator includes a display of the point in time at which it is currently located. In the illustrated example the time associated with visual indicator is 12 44 43 PM. In one implementation visual indicator further includes a display of a value reflected in each of the graphical visualizations for the different KPIs at the current point in time illustrated by visual indicator . In the illustrated example the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 3.65 the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 60 and the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 0. In one implementation units for the values of the KPIs are not displayed. In another implementation units for the values of the KPIs are displayed. In one implementation when visual indicator is located a time between two known data points i.e. between the vertices of the graphical visualization a value of the KPI at that point in time may be interpolated using linear interpolation techniques. In one implementation when one of lanes is selected e.g. by hovering the cursor over the lane a maximum and a minimum values reflected by the graphical visualization for a corresponding KPI during the current time range are displayed adjacent to visual indicator . For example in lane a maximum value of 200 is displayed and a minimum value of 0 is displayed adjacent to visual indicator . This indicates that the highest value of the KPI corresponding to the graphical visualization in lane during the time period represented by time axis is 200 and the lowest value during the same time period is 0. In other implementations the maximum and minimum values may be displayed for all lanes regardless of whether they are selected or may not be displayed for any lanes.

In one implementation visual interface may include an indication when the values for a KPI reach one of the predefined KPI thresholds. As discussed above during the creation of a KPI the user may define one or more states for the KPI. The states may have corresponding visual characteristics such as colors e.g. red yellow green . In one implementation the graph color of the graphical visualization may correspond to the color defined for the various states. For example if the graphical visualization is a line graph the line may have different colors for values representing different states of the KPI. In another implementation the current value of a selected lane displayed by visual indicator may change color to correspond to the colors defined for the various states of the KPI. In another implementation the values of all lanes displayed by visual indicator may change color based on the state regardless of which lane is currently selected. In another implementation there may be a line or bar running parallel to at least one of lanes that is colored according to the colors defined for the various KPI states when the value of the corresponding KPI reaches or passes a defined threshold causing the KPI to change states. In yet another implementation there may be horizontal lines running along the length of at least one lane to indicate where the thresholds defining different KPI states are located on the vertical axis of the lane. In other implementations the thresholds may be indicated in visual interface in some other manner.

At block the computing machine displays the determined value adjacent to lane inspector for each of the graphical visualizations in the visual interface. In the example illustrated in the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 3.65 the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 60 and the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 0. If the lane inspector is moved to a new position representing a different time the operations at blocks may be repeated.

At block the computing machine receives a selection of one of the lanes or graphical visualizations within a lane in the visual interface. In one implementation one of graph lanes is selected by hovering the cursor over the lane. At block the computing machine determines the maximum and minimum values of the KPI dataset associated with the selected lane. In one implementation a search query associated with the KPI is executed for a selected period of time. The results of the query return a dataset of KPI values as shown in . The maximum and minimum values from this dataset can be determined. At block the computing machine displays the maximum and minimum values adjacent to lane inspector . For example in lane a maximum value of 200 is displayed and a minimum value of 0 is displayed adjacent to lane inspector .

In one implementation visual indicator includes a display of the point in time at which it is currently located. In the illustrated example the time associated with visual indicator is 01 26 47 PM. In one implementation visual indicator further includes a display of a value reflected in each of the graphical visualizations including multi series lane at the current point in time illustrated by visual indicator . In one implementation in multi series lane the visual indicator displays the maximum minimum and average values among each of the multiple series at the given point in time. In the illustrated example the graphical visualizations in lane have a maximum value of 4260.11 and a minimum value of 58.95. In one implementation an indication of the series to which the maximum and minimum values correspond may also be displayed e.g. the hosts named vulcan and tristanhydra4 respectively . Further the visual indicator may display the average value of the multiple series at the given point in time e.g. 889.41 .

In one implementation GUI can receive user input for a number of input fields selections from drop down menus or selection of selection buttons or link . In one implementation input field can be used to edit the title for the graphical visualization. Input field may be used to edit the subtitle or description of the graphical visualization. In one implementation drop down menu can be used to edit the graph style and drop down menu can be used to edit the graph color for the graphical visualization. For example upon selection of drop down menu a number of available colors may be displayed for selection by the user. Upon selection of a color the corresponding graphical visualization may be displayed in the selected color. In one implementation no two graphical visualizations in the same visual interface may have the same color. Accordingly the available colors displayed for selection may not include any colors already used for other graphical visualizations. In one implementation the color of a graphical visualization may be determined automatically according to the colors associated with defined thresholds for the corresponding KPI. In such an implementation the user may not be allowed to edit the graph color in drop down menu .

Selection buttons may be used to edit a search source for the graphical visualization. In the illustrated implementation an Ad Hoc search source has been selected. In response an input field may display a user input search query. The search query may include search criteria e.g. keywords field value pairs that produce a dataset or a search result of events or other data that satisfy the search criteria. In one implementation a user may edit the search query by making changes additions or deletions to the search query displayed in input field . The Ad Hoc search query may be executed to generate a dataset of values that can be plotted over the time range as a graphical visualization e.g. as shown in visual interface . Selection of link may indicate that the user wants to execute the search query in input field . Upon the editing of data and or the selection menu items the selection of button may indicate that the editing of the graphical visualization is complete.

At block the computing device determines the maximum and minimum values in the selected subset of values for each KPI and at block adjusts the time axis of the lanes in the graphical visualization to reflect the new time range. In one implementation the subset is expanded to fill the entire length or nearly the entire length of graph lanes . The horizontal axis of each lane may be scaled according to the selected subset . At block the computing device adjusts the height of the lanes based on the new maximum and minimum values. In one implementation the vertical axis of each lane is scaled according to the maximum and minimum values reflected by the graphical visualization for a corresponding KPI during the selected subset . At block the computing device modifies the graphs based on the subsets of values and calibrates the graphs to the same time scale based on the new time range. Additional details are described with respect to .

In one implementation time access is updated according to the selected subset . The time axis may include an indication of the amount of time represented by the time scale e.g. Viewport 5 m indicating that the graphical visualizations in graph lanes display KPI values for a time range of five minutes and an indication of the actual time of day represented by the original time scale e.g. 12 30 12 45 01 PM 01 15 . In one implementation a bar running parallel to the time lanes including the indication of the amount of time represented by the time scale e.g. Viewport 1 h 1 m is highlighted for a proportional subset of the length of time axis and only in a location along time axis corresponding to the subset. In the illustrated embodiment the highlighted portion of the horizontal bar indicates that the selected subset occurs sometime between 01 PM and 01 15. In one implementation at least a portion of the time axis is displayed above the graph lanes as well. This portion of the time axis indicates the actual time of day represented by the selected subset e.g. 01 05 01 06 01 07 01 08 01 09 . In one implementation a user may return to the un zoomed view of the original time period by clicking the non highlighted portion of the horizontal bar in the time axis .

In one implementation visual indicator includes a display of the point in time at which it is currently located both in original lanes and twin lanes . In the illustrated example the times associated with visual indicator are Thu September 4 01 35 34 PM for the original lanes and Wed September 3 01 35 34 PM for the twin lanes. Thus the twin lanes show values of the same KPI from the same time range on the previous day. In one implementation visual indicator further includes a display of a value reflected in each of the graphical visualizations for the different KPIs at the point in time corresponding to the position of visual indicator . In the illustrated example the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 0 the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 1.52 the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 36 the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 31 the value of the graphical visualization in lane is 0 and lane has no data available. In one implementation the graphical visualizations in twin lanes have the same graph type and a similar graph color as the graphical visualizations in the corresponding graph lanes . In another implementation the second graphical visualizations are configurable such that the user can adjust the graph type and the graph color. In one implementation rather than being displayed in twin parallel lanes the second graphical visualizations may be overlaid on top of the original graphical visualizations.

In one implementation the notable events occurring during the period of time represented by time axis are displayed as flags or bubbles in a bubble chart in additional lane . The flags may be located at a position along time axis corresponding to when the notable event occurred. In one implementation the flags may be color coded to vindicate the severity or importance of the notable event. In one implementation when one of the flags is selected e.g. by clicking on the flag or hovering the cursor over the flag a description of the notable event may be displayed. As illustrated in the description may be displayed in a horizontal bar along the bottom of lane . In another implementation as illustrated in the description may be displayed adjacent to the selected flag . In one implementation user manipulable visual indicator may be used to select a particular flag . For example when visual indicator is slid along the length of lane a description of a corresponding notable event at the same time may be displayed.

In some implementations search queries for KPIs and correlation searches can derive values using a late binding schema that the search queries apply to machine data. Late binding schema is described in greater detail below. The systems and methods described herein above may be employed by various data processing systems e.g. data aggregation and analysis systems. In various illustrative examples the data processing system may be represented by the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system produced by Splunk Inc. of San Francisco Calif. to store and process performance data.

Modern data centers often comprise thousands of host computer systems that operate collectively to service requests from even larger numbers of remote clients. During operation these data centers generate significant volumes of performance data and diagnostic information that can be analyzed to quickly diagnose performance problems. In order to reduce the size of this performance data the data is typically pre processed prior to being stored based on anticipated data analysis needs. For example pre specified data items can be extracted from the performance data and stored in a database to facilitate efficient retrieval and analysis at search time. However the rest of the performance data is not saved and is essentially discarded during pre processing. As storage capacity becomes progressively cheaper and more plentiful there are fewer incentives to discard this performance data and many reasons to keep it.

This plentiful storage capacity is presently making it feasible to store massive quantities of minimally processed performance data at ingestion time for later retrieval and analysis at search time. Note that performing the analysis operations at search time provides greater flexibility because it enables an analyst to search all of the performance data instead of searching pre specified data items that were stored at ingestion time. This enables the analyst to investigate different implementations of the performance data instead of being confined to the pre specified set of data items that were selected at ingestion time.

However analyzing massive quantities of heterogeneous performance data at search time can be a challenging task. A data center may generate heterogeneous performance data from thousands of different components which can collectively generate tremendous volumes of performance data that can be time consuming to analyze. For example this performance data can include data from system logs network packet data sensor data and data generated by various applications. Also the unstructured nature of much of this performance data can pose additional challenges because of the difficulty of applying semantic meaning to unstructured data and the difficulty of indexing and querying unstructured data using traditional database systems.

These challenges can be addressed by using an event based system such as the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system produced by Splunk Inc. of San Francisco Calif. to store and process performance data. The SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system is the leading platform for providing real time operational intelligence that enables organizations to collect index and harness machine generated data from various websites applications servers networks and mobile devices that power their businesses. The SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system is particularly useful for analyzing unstructured performance data which is commonly found in system log files. Although many of the techniques described herein are explained with reference to the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system the techniques are also applicable to other types of data server systems.

In the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system performance data is stored as events wherein each event comprises a collection of performance data and or diagnostic information that is generated by a computer system and is correlated with a specific point in time. Events can be derived from time series data wherein time series data comprises a sequence of data points e.g. performance measurements from a computer system that are associated with successive points in time and are typically spaced at uniform time intervals. Events can also be derived from structured or unstructured data. Structured data has a predefined format wherein specific data items with specific data formats reside at predefined locations in the data. For example structured data can include data items stored in fields in a database table. In contrast unstructured data does not have a predefined format. This means that unstructured data can comprise various data items having different data types that can reside at different locations. For example when the data source is an operating system log an event can include one or more lines from the operating system log containing raw data that includes different types of performance and diagnostic information associated with a specific point in time. Examples of data sources from which an event may be derived include but are not limited to web servers application servers databases firewalls routers operating systems and software applications that execute on computer systems mobile devices and sensors. The data generated by such data sources can be produced in various forms including for example and without limitation server log files activity log files configuration files messages network packet data performance measurements and sensor measurements. An event typically includes a timestamp that may be derived from the raw data in the event or may be determined through interpolation between temporally proximate events having known timestamps.

The SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system also facilitates using a flexible schema to specify how to extract information from the event data wherein the flexible schema may be developed and redefined as needed. Note that a flexible schema may be applied to event data on the fly when it is needed e.g. at search time rather than at ingestion time of the data as in traditional database systems. Because the schema is not applied to event data until it is needed e.g. at search time it is referred to as a late binding schema. 

During operation the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system starts with raw data which can include unstructured data machine data performance measurements or other time series data such as data obtained from weblogs syslogs or sensor readings. It divides this raw data into portions and optionally transforms the data to produce timestamped events. The system stores the timestamped events in a data store and enables a user to run queries against the data store to retrieve events that meet specified criteria such as containing certain keywords or having specific values in defined fields. Note that the term field refers to a location in the event data containing a value for a specific data item.

As noted above the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system facilitates using a late binding schema while performing queries on events. A late binding schema specifies extraction rules that are applied to data in the events to extract values for specific fields. More specifically the extraction rules for a field can include one or more instructions that specify how to extract a value for the field from the event data. An extraction rule can generally include any type of instruction for extracting values from data in events. In some cases an extraction rule comprises a regular expression in which case the rule is referred to as a regex rule. 

In contrast to a conventional schema for a database system a late binding schema is not defined at data ingestion time. Instead the late binding schema can be developed on an ongoing basis until the time a query is actually executed. This means that extraction rules for the fields in a query may be provided in the query itself or may be located during execution of the query. Hence as an analyst learns more about the data in the events the analyst can continue to refine the late binding schema by adding new fields deleting fields or changing the field extraction rules until the next time the schema is used by a query. Because the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system maintains the underlying raw data and provides a late binding schema for searching the raw data it enables an analyst to investigate questions that arise as the analyst learns more about the events.

In the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system a field extractor may be configured to automatically generate extraction rules for certain fields in the events when the events are being created indexed or stored or possibly at a later time. Alternatively a user may manually define extraction rules for fields using a variety of techniques.

Also a number of default fields that specify metadata about the events rather than data in the events themselves can be created automatically. For example such default fields can specify a timestamp for the event data a host from which the event data originated a source of the event data and a source type for the event data. These default fields may be determined automatically when the events are created indexed or stored.

In some embodiments a common field name may be used to reference two or more fields containing equivalent data items even though the fields may be associated with different types of events that possibly have different data formats and different extraction rules. By enabling a common field name to be used to identify equivalent fields from different types of events generated by different data sources the system facilitates use of a common information model CIM across the different data sources.

During operation the forwarders identify which indexers will receive the collected data and then forward the data to the identified indexers. Forwarders can also perform operations to strip out extraneous data and detect timestamps in the data. The forwarders next determine which indexers will receive each data item and then forward the data items to the determined indexers .

Note that distributing data across different indexers facilitates parallel processing. This parallel processing can take place at data ingestion time because multiple indexers can process the incoming data in parallel. The parallel processing can also take place at search time because multiple indexers can search through the data in parallel.

System and the processes described below with respect to are further described in Exploring Splunk Search Processing Language SPL Primer and Cookbook by David Carasso CITO Research 2012 and in Optimizing Data Analysis With a Semi Structured Time Series Database by Ledion Bitincka Archana Ganapathi Stephen Sorkin and Steve Zhang SLAML 2010 each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Next the indexer determines a timestamp for each event at block . As mentioned above these timestamps can be determined by extracting the time directly from data in the event or by interpolating the time based on timestamps from temporally proximate events. In some cases a timestamp can be determined based on the time the data was received or generated. The indexer subsequently associates the determined timestamp with each event at block for example by storing the timestamp as metadata for each event.

Then the system can apply transformations to data to be included in events at block . For log data such transformations can include removing a portion of an event e.g. a portion used to define event boundaries extraneous text characters etc. or removing redundant portions of an event. Note that a user can specify portions to be removed using a regular expression or any other possible technique.

Next a keyword index can optionally be generated to facilitate fast keyword searching for events. To build a keyword index the indexer first identifies a set of keywords in block . Then at block the indexer includes the identified keywords in an index which associates each stored keyword with references to events containing that keyword or to locations within events where that keyword is located . When an indexer subsequently receives a keyword based query the indexer can access the keyword index to quickly identify events containing the keyword.

In some embodiments the keyword index may include entries for name value pairs found in events wherein a name value pair can include a pair of keywords connected by a symbol such as an equals sign or colon. In this way events containing these name value pairs can be quickly located. In some embodiments fields can automatically be generated for some or all of the name value pairs at the time of indexing. For example if the string dest 10.0.1.2 is found in an event a field named dest may be created for the event and assigned a value of 10.0.1.2. 

Finally the indexer stores the events in a data store at block wherein a timestamp can be stored with each event to facilitate searching for events based on a time range. In some cases the stored events are organized into a plurality of buckets wherein each bucket stores events associated with a specific time range. This not only improves time based searches but it also allows events with recent timestamps that may have a higher likelihood of being accessed to be stored in faster memory to facilitate faster retrieval. For example a bucket containing the most recent events can be stored as flash memory instead of on hard disk.

Each indexer is responsible for storing and searching a subset of the events contained in a corresponding data store . By distributing events among the indexers and data stores the indexers can analyze events for a query in parallel for example using map reduce techniques wherein each indexer returns partial responses for a subset of events to a search head that combines the results to produce an answer for the query. By storing events in buckets for specific time ranges an indexer may further optimize searching by looking only in buckets for time ranges that are relevant to a query.

Moreover events and buckets can also be replicated across different indexers and data stores to facilitate high availability and disaster recovery as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 266 812 filed on 30 Apr. 2014 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 266 817 also filed on 30 Apr. 2014.

Then at block the indexers to which the query was distributed search their data stores for events that are responsive to the query. To determine which events are responsive to the query the indexer searches for events that match the criteria specified in the query. This criteria can include matching keywords or specific values for certain fields. In a query that uses a late binding schema the searching operations in block may involve using the late binding scheme to extract values for specified fields from events at the time the query is processed. Next the indexers can either send the relevant events back to the search head or use the events to calculate a partial result and send the partial result back to the search head.

Finally at block the search head combines the partial results and or events received from the indexers to produce a final result for the query. This final result can comprise different types of data depending upon what the query is asking for. For example the final results can include a listing of matching events returned by the query or some type of visualization of data from the returned events. In another example the final result can include one or more calculated values derived from the matching events.

Moreover the results generated by system can be returned to a client using different techniques. For example one technique streams results back to a client in real time as they are identified. Another technique waits to report results to the client until a complete set of results is ready to return to the client. Yet another technique streams interim results back to the client in real time until a complete set of results is ready and then returns the complete set of results to the client. In another technique certain results are stored as search jobs and the client may subsequently retrieve the results by referencing the search jobs.

The search head can also perform various operations to make the search more efficient. For example before the search head starts executing a query the search head can determine a time range for the query and a set of common keywords that all matching events must include. Next the search head can use these parameters to query the indexers to obtain a superset of the eventual results. Then during a filtering stage the search head can perform field extraction operations on the superset to produce a reduced set of search results.

Upon receiving search query query processor sees that search query includes two fields IP and target. Query processor also determines that the values for the IP and target fields have not already been extracted from events in data store and consequently determines that query processor needs to use extraction rules to extract values for the fields. Hence query processor performs a lookup for the extraction rules in a rule base wherein rule base maps field names to corresponding extraction rules and obtains extraction rules wherein extraction rule specifies how to extract a value for the IP field from an event and extraction rule specifies how to extract a value for the target field from an event. As is illustrated in extraction rules can comprise regular expressions that specify how to extract values for the relevant fields. Such regular expression based extraction rules are also referred to as regex rules. In addition to specifying how to extract field values the extraction rules may also include instructions for deriving a field value by performing a function on a character string or value retrieved by the extraction rule. For example a transformation rule may truncate a character string or convert the character string into a different data format. In some cases the query itself can specify one or more extraction rules.

Next query processor sends extraction rules to a field extractor which applies extraction rules to events in a data store . Note that data store can include one or more data stores and extraction rules can be applied to large numbers of events in data store and are not meant to be limited to the three events illustrated in . Moreover the query processor can instruct field extractor to apply the extraction rules to all the events in a data store or to a subset of the events that have been filtered based on some criteria.

Next field extractor applies extraction rule for the first command Search IP 10 to events in data store including events . Extraction rule is used to extract values for the IP address field from events in data store by looking for a pattern of one or more digits followed by a period followed again by one or more digits followed by another period followed again by one or more digits followed by another period and followed again by one or more digits. Next field extractor returns field values to query processor which uses the criterion IP 10 to look for IP addresses that start with 10 . Note that events and match this criterion but event does not so the result set for the first command is events .

Query processor then sends events to the next command stats count target. To process this command query processor causes field extractor to apply extraction rule to events . Extraction rule is used to extract values for the target field for events by skipping the first four commas in events and then extracting all of the following characters until a comma or period is reached. Next field extractor returns field values to query processor which executes the command stats count target to count the number of unique values contained in the target fields which in this example produces the value 2 that is returned as a final result for the query.

Note that query results can be returned to a client a search head or any other system component for further processing. In general query results may include a set of one or more events a set of one or more values obtained from the events a subset of the values statistics calculated based on the values a report containing the values or a visualization such as a graph or chart generated from the values.

Creating queries requires knowledge of the fields that are included in the events being searched as well as knowledge of the query processing language used for the queries. While a data analyst may possess domain understanding of underlying data and knowledge of the query processing language an end user responsible for creating reports at a company e.g. a marketing specialist may not have such expertise. In order to assist end users implementations of the event processing system described herein provide data models that simplify the creation of reports and other visualizations.

A data model encapsulates semantic knowledge about certain events. A data model can be composed of one or more objects grouped in a hierarchical manner. In general the objects included in a data model may be related to each other in some way. In particular a data model can include a root object and optionally one or more child objects that can be linked either directly or indirectly to the root object. A root object can be defined by search criteria for a query to produce a certain set of events and a set of fields that can be exposed to operate on those events. A root object can be a parent of one or more child objects and any of those child objects can optionally be a parent of one or more additional child objects. Each child object can inherit the search criteria of its parent object and have additional search criteria to further filter out events represented by its parent object. Each child object may also include at least some of the fields of its parent object and optionally additional fields specific to the child object.

Definition of child object includes search criteria and a set of fields . Search criteria inherits search criteria of the parent object and includes an additional criterion of status 200 which indicates that the search query should produce web access requests that qualify as unsuccessful purchase events. Fields consist of the fields inherited from the parent object . As shown child objects and include all the fields inherited from the parent object . In other implementations child objects may only include some of the fields of the parent object and or may include additional fields that are not exposed by the parent object.

When creating a report a user can select an object of a data model to focus on the events represented by the selected object. The user can then view the fields of the data object and request the event processing system to structure the report based on those fields. For example the user can request the event processing system to add some fields to the report to add calculations based on some fields to the report to group data in the report based on some fields etc. The user can also input additional constraints e.g. specific values and or mathematical expressions for some of the fields to further filter out events on which the report should be focused.

After the search is executed the search screen can display the results through search results tabs wherein search results tabs includes an events tab that displays various information about events returned by the search a statistics tab that displays statistics about the search results and a visualization tab that displays various visualizations of the search results. The events tab illustrated in displays a timeline graph that graphically illustrates the number of events that occurred in one hour intervals over the selected time range. It also displays an events list that enables a user to view the raw data in each of the returned events. It additionally displays a fields sidebar that includes statistics about occurrences of specific fields in the returned events including selected fields that are pre selected by the user and interesting fields that are automatically selected by the system based on pre specified criteria.

The above described system provides significant flexibility by enabling a user to analyze massive quantities of minimally processed performance data on the fly at search time instead of storing pre specified portions of the performance data in a database at ingestion time. This flexibility enables a user to see correlations in the performance data and perform subsequent queries to examine interesting implementations of the performance data that may not have been apparent at ingestion time.

However performing extraction and analysis operations at search time can involve a large amount of data and require a large number of computational operations which can cause considerable delays while processing the queries. Fortunately a number of acceleration techniques have been developed to speed up analysis operations performed at search time. These techniques include 1 performing search operations in parallel by formulating a search as a map reduce computation 2 using a keyword index 3 using a high performance analytics store and 4 accelerating the process of generating reports. These techniques are described in more detail below.

To facilitate faster query processing a query can be structured as a map reduce computation wherein the map operations are delegated to the indexers while the corresponding reduce operations are performed locally at the search head. For example illustrates how a search query received from a client at search head can split into two phases including 1 a map phase comprising subtasks e.g. data retrieval or simple filtering that may be performed in parallel and are mapped to indexers for execution and 2 a reduce phase comprising a merging operation to be executed by the search head when the results are ultimately collected from the indexers.

During operation upon receiving search query search head modifies search query by substituting stats with prestats to produce search query and then distributes search query to one or more distributed indexers which are also referred to as search peers. Note that search queries may generally specify search criteria or operations to be performed on events that meet the search criteria. Search queries may also specify field names as well as search criteria for the values in the fields or operations to be performed on the values in the fields. Moreover the search head may distribute the full search query to the search peers as is illustrated in or may alternatively distribute a modified version e.g. a more restricted version of the search query to the search peers. In this example the indexers are responsible for producing the results and sending them to the search head. After the indexers return the results to the search head the search head performs the merging operations on the results. Note that by executing the computation in this way the system effectively distributes the computational operations while minimizing data transfers.

As described above with reference to the flow charts in event processing system can construct and maintain one or more keyword indices to facilitate rapidly identifying events containing specific keywords. This can greatly speed up the processing of queries involving specific keywords. As mentioned above to build a keyword index an indexer first identifies a set of keywords. Then the indexer includes the identified keywords in an index which associates each stored keyword with references to events containing that keyword or to locations within events where that keyword is located. When an indexer subsequently receives a keyword based query the indexer can access the keyword index to quickly identify events containing the keyword.

To speed up certain types of queries some embodiments of system make use of a high performance analytics store which is referred to as a summarization table that contains entries for specific field value pairs. Each of these entries keeps track of instances of a specific value in a specific field in the event data and includes references to events containing the specific value in the specific field. For example an exemplary entry in a summarization table can keep track of occurrences of the value 94107 in a ZIP code field of a set of events wherein the entry includes references to all of the events that contain the value 94107 in the ZIP code field. This enables the system to quickly process queries that seek to determine how many events have a particular value for a particular field because the system can examine the entry in the summarization table to count instances of the specific value in the field without having to go through the individual events or do extractions at search time. Also if the system needs to process all events that have a specific field value combination the system can use the references in the summarization table entry to directly access the events to extract further information without having to search all of the events to find the specific field value combination at search time.

In some embodiments the system maintains a separate summarization table for each of the above described time specific buckets that stores events for a specific time range wherein a bucket specific summarization table includes entries for specific field value combinations that occur in events in the specific bucket. Alternatively the system can maintain a separate summarization table for each indexer wherein the indexer specific summarization table only includes entries for the events in a data store that is managed by the specific indexer.

The summarization table can be populated by running a collection query that scans a set of events to find instances of a specific field value combination or alternatively instances of all field value combinations for a specific field. A collection query can be initiated by a user or can be scheduled to occur automatically at specific time intervals. A collection query can also be automatically launched in response to a query that asks for a specific field value combination.

In some cases the summarization tables may not cover all of the events that are relevant to a query. In this case the system can use the summarization tables to obtain partial results for the events that are covered by summarization tables but may also have to search through other events that are not covered by the summarization tables to produce additional results. These additional results can then be combined with the partial results to produce a final set of results for the query. This summarization table and associated techniques are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 8 682 925 issued on Mar. 25 2014.

In some embodiments a data server system such as the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system can accelerate the process of periodically generating updated reports based on query results. To accelerate this process a summarization engine automatically examines the query to determine whether generation of updated reports can be accelerated by creating intermediate summaries. This is possible if results from preceding time periods can be computed separately and combined to generate an updated report. In some cases it is not possible to combine such incremental results for example where a value in the report depends on relationships between events from different time periods. If reports can be accelerated the summarization engine periodically generates a summary covering data obtained during a latest non overlapping time period. For example where the query seeks events meeting a specified criteria a summary for the time period includes only events within the time period that meet the specified criteria. Similarly if the query seeks statistics calculated from the events such as the number of events that match the specified criteria then the summary for the time period includes the number of events in the period that match the specified criteria.

In parallel with the creation of the summaries the summarization engine schedules the periodic updating of the report associated with the query. During each scheduled report update the query engine determines whether intermediate summaries have been generated covering portions of the time period covered by the report update. If so then the report is generated based on the information contained in the summaries. Also if additional event data has been received and has not yet been summarized and is required to generate the complete report the query can be run on this additional event data. Then the results returned by this query on the additional event data along with the partial results obtained from the intermediate summaries can be combined to generate the updated report. This process is repeated each time the report is updated. Alternatively if the system stores events in buckets covering specific time ranges then the summaries can be generated on a bucket by bucket basis. Note that producing intermediate summaries can save the work involved in re running the query for previous time periods so only the newer event data needs to be processed while generating an updated report. These report acceleration techniques are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 8 589 403 issued on Nov. 19 2013 and U.S. Pat. No. 8 412 696 issued on Apr. 2 2011.

The SPLUNK ENTERPRISE platform provides various schemas dashboards and visualizations that make it easy for developers to create applications to provide additional capabilities. One such application is the SPLUNK APP FOR ENTERPRISE SECURITY which performs monitoring and alerting operations and includes analytics to facilitate identifying both known and unknown security threats based on large volumes of data stored by the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system. This differs significantly from conventional Security Information and Event Management STEM systems that lack the infrastructure to effectively store and analyze large volumes of security related event data. Traditional STEM systems typically use fixed schemas to extract data from pre defined security related fields at data ingestion time wherein the extracted data is typically stored in a relational database. This data extraction process and associated reduction in data size that occurs at data ingestion time inevitably hampers future incident investigations when all of the original data may be needed to determine the root cause of a security issue or to detect the tiny fingerprints of an impending security threat.

In contrast the SPLUNK APP FOR ENTERPRISE SECURITY system stores large volumes of minimally processed security related data at ingestion time for later retrieval and analysis at search time when a live security threat is being investigated. To facilitate this data retrieval process the SPLUNK APP FOR ENTERPRISE SECURITY provides pre specified schemas for extracting relevant values from the different types of security related event data and also enables a user to define such schemas.

The SPLUNK APP FOR ENTERPRISE SECURITY can process many types of security related information. In general this security related information can include any information that can be used to identify security threats. For example the security related information can include network related information such as IP addresses domain names asset identifiers network traffic volume uniform resource locator strings and source addresses. The process of detecting security threats for network related information is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 956 252 and 13 956 262. Security related information can also include endpoint information such as malware infection data and system configuration information as well as access control information such as login logout information and access failure notifications. The security related information can originate from various sources within a data center such as hosts virtual machines storage devices and sensors. The security related information can also originate from various sources in a network such as routers switches email servers proxy servers gateways firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

During operation the SPLUNK APP FOR ENTERPRISE SECURITY facilitates detecting so called notable events that are likely to indicate a security threat. These notable events can be detected in a number of ways 1 an analyst can notice a correlation in the data and can manually identify a corresponding group of one or more events as notable or 2 an analyst can define a correlation search specifying criteria for a notable event and every time one or more events satisfy the criteria the application can indicate that the one or more events are notable. An analyst can alternatively select a pre defined correlation search provided by the application. Note that correlation searches can be run continuously or at regular intervals e.g. every hour to search for notable events. Upon detection notable events can be stored in a dedicated notable events index which can be subsequently accessed to generate various visualizations containing security related information. Also alerts can be generated to notify system operators when important notable events are discovered.

The SPLUNK APP FOR ENTERPRISE SECURITY provides various visualizations to aid in discovering security threats such as a key indicators view that enables a user to view security metrics of interest such as counts of different types of notable events. For example illustrates an exemplary key indicators view that comprises a dashboard which can display a value for various security related metrics such as malware infections . It can also display a change in a metric value which indicates that the number of malware infections increased by 63 during the preceding interval. Key indicators view additionally displays a histogram panel that displays a histogram of notable events organized by urgency values and a histogram of notable events organized by time intervals. This key indicators view is described in further detail in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 956 338 filed Jul. 31 2013.

These visualizations can also include an incident review dashboard that enables a user to view and act on notable events. These notable events can include 1 a single event of high importance such as any activity from a known web attacker or 2 multiple events that collectively warrant review such as a large number of authentication failures on a host followed by a successful authentication. For example illustrates an exemplary incident review dashboard that includes a set of incident attribute fields that for example enables a user to specify a time range field for the displayed events. It also includes a timeline that graphically illustrates the number of incidents that occurred in one hour time intervals over the selected time range. It additionally displays an events list that enables a user to view a list of all of the notable events that match the criteria in the incident attributes fields . To facilitate identifying patterns among the notable events each notable event can be associated with an urgency value e.g. low medium high critical which is indicated in the incident review dashboard. The urgency value for a detected event can be determined based on the severity of the event and the priority of the system component associated with the event. The incident review dashboard is described further in http docs.splunk.com Documentation PCI 2.1.1 User IncidentReviewdashboard. 

As mentioned above the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE platform provides various features that make it easy for developers to create various applications. One such application is the SPLUNK APP FOR VMWARE which performs monitoring operations and includes analytics to facilitate diagnosing the root cause of performance problems in a data center based on large volumes of data stored by the SPLUNK ENTERPRISE system.

This differs from conventional data center monitoring systems that lack the infrastructure to effectively store and analyze large volumes of performance information and log data obtained from the data center. In conventional data center monitoring systems this performance data is typically pre processed prior to being stored for example by extracting pre specified data items from the performance data and storing them in a database to facilitate subsequent retrieval and analysis at search time. However the rest of the performance data is not saved and is essentially discarded during pre processing. In contrast the SPLUNK APP FOR VMWARE stores large volumes of minimally processed performance information and log data at ingestion time for later retrieval and analysis at search time when a live performance issue is being investigated.

The SPLUNK APP FOR VMWARE can process many types of performance related information. In general this performance related information can include any type of performance related data and log data produced by virtual machines and host computer systems in a data center. In addition to data obtained from various log files this performance related information can include values for performance metrics obtained through an application programming interface API provided as part of the vSphere Hypervisor system distributed by VMware Inc. of Palo Alto Calif. For example these performance metrics can include 1 CPU related performance metrics 2 disk related performance metrics 3 memory related performance metrics 4 network related performance metrics 5 energy usage statistics 6 data traffic related performance metrics 7 overall system availability performance metrics 8 cluster related performance metrics and 9 virtual machine performance statistics. For more details about such performance metrics please see U.S. patent Ser. No. 14 167 316 filed 29 Jan. 2014 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Also see vSphere Monitoring and Performance Update 1 vSphere 5.5 EN 001357 00 http pubs.vmware.com vsphere 55 topic com.vmware.ICbase PDF vsphere esxi vcenter server 551 monitoring performance guide.pdf.

To facilitate retrieving information of interest from performance data and log files the SPLUNK APP FOR VMWARE provides pre specified schemas for extracting relevant values from different types of performance related event data and also enables a user to define such schemas.

The SPLUNK APP FOR VMWARE additionally provides various visualizations to facilitate detecting and diagnosing the root cause of performance problems. For example one such visualization is a proactive monitoring tree that enables a user to easily view and understand relationships among various factors that affect the performance of a hierarchically structured computing system. This proactive monitoring tree enables a user to easily navigate the hierarchy by selectively expanding nodes representing various entities e.g. virtual centers or computing clusters to view performance information for lower level nodes associated with lower level entities e.g. virtual machines or host systems . Exemplary node expansion operations are illustrated in wherein nodes and are selectively expanded. Note that nodes can be displayed using different patterns or colors to represent different performance states such as a critical state a warning state a normal state or an unknown offline state. The ease of navigation provided by selective expansion in combination with the associated performance state information enables a user to quickly diagnose the root cause of a performance problem. The proactive monitoring tree is described in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 235 490 filed on 15 Apr. 2014 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all possible purposes.

The SPLUNK APP FOR VMWARE also provides a user interface that enables a user to select a specific time range and then view heterogeneous data comprising events log data and associated performance metrics for the selected time range. For example the screen illustrated in displays a listing of recent tasks and events and a listing of recent log entries for a selected time range above a performance metric graph for average CPU core utilization for the selected time range. Note that a user is able to operate pull down menus to selectively display different performance metric graphs for the selected time range. This enables the user to correlate trends in the performance metric graph with corresponding event and log data to quickly determine the root cause of a performance problem. This user interface is described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 167 316 filed on 29 Jan. 2014 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all possible purposes.

It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.

Implementations that are described may include graphical user interfaces GUIs . Frequently an element that appears in a GUI display is associated or bound to particular data in the underlying computer system. The GUI element may be used to indicate the particular data by displaying the data in some fashion and may possibly enable the user to interact to indicate the data in a desired changed form or value. In such cases where a GUI element is associated or bound to particular data it is a common shorthand to refer to the data indications of the GUI element as the GUI element itself and vice versa. The reader is reminded of such shorthand and that the context renders the intended meaning clear to one of skill in the art where a distinction between a GUI element and the data to which it is bound is meaningful.

It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. The scope of the invention should therefore be determined with reference to the appended claims along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
