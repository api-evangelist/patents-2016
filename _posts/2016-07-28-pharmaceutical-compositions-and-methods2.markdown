This invention relates the use of cortisol blockers e.g. glucocorticoid receptor GR antagonists for the treating or preventing viral infections treatment resistant prostate cancer treating or preventing neoplasia and treating or preventing infection related to acute or chronic injury or disease.

Rapid advances in technology of all kinds and advances in travel and globalization have had substantial impacts on improving the human condition within the United States and internationally. However both all of these advances have proven to be a double edged sword allowing for the easy spread of invasive species and disease whether it be accidental or intentional. The United States government has been proactive in its work to legislate and fund medical countermeasures work in response to the potential for public health emergencies initiated by the introduction of pathogens. Key among these responses have been the 2004 Project Bioshield Act and the 2006 Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act the latter of which provides opportunities through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA .

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institutes of Health NIAID a component of the National Institute of Health NIH maintains a list of emerging infectious diseases and pathogens for purposes of prioritization and research guidance. Pathogens are prioritized from A C based on the traits of transmissibility morbidity mortality and diagnostics. Additionally a list of emerging pathogens and diseases is included which are unclassified with a priority level. These lists were used as a springboard for study of a series of compounds developed by Palisades Therapeutics PT a division of Pop Test Oncology LLC that have been demonstrated to have antiviral activity against a wide range of human pathogens.

The following sections will provide detailed information on the compounds PT150 and PT155 and viral pathogens from the NIAID lists against which they show or are hypothesized to show activity. We confirmed this activity both in vitro and in animal models. This activity includes Zika virus. We believe their activity levels as antivirals against Flavivirus and possibly other RNA virus prioritizes their movement into clinical testing.

PT 150 is a re purposed drug acquired from a major pharmaceutical company that has a transferable IND that would allow it to be rapidly placed into a human clinical trial population if it is determined that this is justified. The compound previously completed all of its IND enabling preclinical studies a significant Phase 1 study in humans and two large Phase 2 human trials for psychotic depression. PT 150 has unique properties as an antiviral drug in that it has the ability to penetrate to sanctuary sites like the brain thymus and testicles. It thus may have the potential to clear virus from these sites through direct antiviral activity whereby infected cells are inhibited from replicating virus and are cleared by apoptosis.

PT 155 is a derivative of PT 150 that has demonstrated even higher activity related to the putative mechanism of action that could result in even greater efficacy. PT150 would require a Phase III Clinical Trial. PT155 would require IND enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies and IND enabling CMC programs.

PT 150 formerly Org34517 and its derivative molecules PT 155 and PT 156 have at least two general mechanisms of anti viral action effect against abroad array of viruses infecting animals and humans. The first anti viral effects are mediated through binding of these molecules to glucocorticoid response elements GREs present in some viral genomes. The second is through binding of these molecules to phosphatidylserine PS present in the envelope of all enveloped viruses.

Viruses that infect animals and humans infect cells by placing their genetic material within the cytoplasm and or nucleoplasm of the infected cell. Response elements within the genome which may comprise coding regions or non coding regions respond to molecular signaling of the host cell and or other elements of the virus own molecular network. Viruses often have GREs namely response elements that are under the influence of glucocorticoid signaling mediated by the binding of cortisol or other glucocorticoids to the glucocorticoid receptor GCR .

The viruses that have been identified as having GRE s include Hepatitis C virus Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus Ebola like viruses Hepatitis B virus Mouse mammary tumor virus Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 HIV 1 Varicella Zoster virus chicken pox VZV Cytomegalovirus CMV Human Herpes Virus 6 HHV 6 Human Herpes Virus 7 HHV 7 Kaposi s Sarcoma Associated Herpes virus or Human Herpes Virus 8 HHV 8 Variola Small Pox virus Vaccinia virus Cowpox virus Monkeypox virus

Binding of PT 155 as a GCR antagonist as well as of its derivatives including but not limited to PT 155 and PT 156 also modulates the viral GRE to directly or indirectly inhibit fundamental viral functions including but not limited to genetic replication production of virus associated proteins assembly of genetic material and viral proteins into complete viruses increasing genetic diversity promotion of viral active or passive virus release from the cell and viral infectivity .

Moreover these viruses contain viral DNA transcripts that are pro viruses that enable viruses to remain latent in sequestered cellular compartments in the body these DNA pro viral genomes are responsible for latent infection which may erupt into full viral replication in situations when an individual becomes immunocompromised or when suppressive anti viral regimens are interrupted. Binding of these molecules inactivates such pro viral activities by either inactiving the pro virus directly or by causing pro viral genomic mutations that trigger p53 mediated host cell apoptosis. Either way the pro viral genome is destroyed. In these susceptible viruses PT 150 PT 155 and PT 156 as well as other possible derivatives of these molecules will lead to cure of chronic viral infection.

PS is normally sequestered to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayer but during apoptosis the mechanism that normally maintains PS in the inner leaflet is down regulated allowing the appearance of PS on the cell surface. PS exposure is recognition signal for phagocytic cells that clear dying cells. Several macrophage receptors have been implicated in recognizing PS on apoptotic cells including various scavenger receptors CD36 CD14 and PS receptor PSR . Thus PS has a demonstrated ability to mediate cell cell interactions and to function as a ligand for a variety of PS binding receptors.

Enveloped viruses expose PS on their host captured lipid bilayer membranes constantly. Enveloped viruses utilize this PS exposure to evade attacks by the human immune system and to enter phagocytic cells like monocytes macrophages making its appearance in the viral membrane highly suspect as a factor in virus target cell fusion.

Viruses that infect animals and humans infect cells by placing their genetic material within the cytoplasm and or nucleoplasm of the infected cell. Response elements within the genome which may comprise coding regions or non coding regions respond to molecular signaling of the host cell and or other elements of the virus own molecular network. Viruses often have glucocorticoid response elements GRE namely response elements that are under the influence of glucocorticoid signaling mediated by the binding of cortisol or other glucocorticoids to the glucocorticoid receptor GCR .

This binding which is activating leads to signaling cascades modulating endogenous GRE of the host cell as well as viral GRE. Modulation of the viral GRE may directly or indirectly promote viral physiology that will promote fundamental viral functions including but not limited to genetic replication production of virus associated proteins assembly of genetic material and viral proteins into complete viruses increasing genetic diversity promotion of viral active or passive virus release from the cell and viral infectivity.

ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 and TCY1 are members of a class of therapeutic agents designed to block the glucorticoid receptor GR acting as an antagonist for endogenous cortisol. Its primary developmental pathway has been as a treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases that are characterized by dysregulated signaling in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis often with higher than normal circulating levels of endogenous cortisol. Of particular note are the phase 2 clinical trials that have been completed for the treatment of psychotic depression. Other possible uses in this disease category which are under investigation include post traumatic stress disorder weight gain in patients requiring long term anti psychotic medication hospital delirium of the elderly etc.

The endogenous glucocorticoids are steroids predominantly produced in the adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoids are important steroids for intermediary metabolism immune musculoskeletal connective tissue and brain function. The main glucocorticoid in the body is cortisol. The production and secretion of cortisol is governed by a complex and highly efficient system that includes the hypothalamus pituitary and the adrenal glands i.e. hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis HPA . Cortisol secretion has a circadian release rhythm with peak values in early morning and trough values at midnight.

The production and secretion of the most important glucocorticoid cortisol is governed by a complex and highly efficient system that includes the hypothalamus pituitary and the adrenal glands i.e. hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. Cortisol secretion is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus into a circadian release rhythm. The timing is synchronized with the solar day by dark light shifts which normally reflect the habitual sleep wake pattern. Therefore in healthy persons the cortisol secretion has a 24 hour circadian pattern with peak serum levels in the early morning 3 6 hours after onset of sleep and nadir levels around midnight. Physical and psychological stressors also activate cortisol secretion. Changed patterns of serum cortisol levels have been observed in connection with abnormal adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH levels clinical depression psychological stress and physiological stressors such as hypoglycemia illness fever trauma surgery fear pain physical exertion or temperature extremes. Cortisol levels and responsiveness may also differ from normal for elderly individuals and in individuals with autism or Asperger s syndrome.

Glucocorticoids GCs such as in humans cortisol perform several important functions. These include participating in the regulation of carbohydrate protein and fat metabolism by signaling the liver to make glucose and glycogen the adipose tissues to release lipids and fatty acids into the bloodstream and the skeletal muscles to release proteins or amino acids into the bloodstream. GCs also decrease bone formation.

GCs also regulate the body s inflammatory response as well. GCs are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system that inhibits immune activity i.e. inflammation . GCs cause their effects by binding to the GCR. The activated GCR complex in turn up regulates the expression of anti inflammatory proteins in the nucleus a process known as transactivation and represses the expression of pro inflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus transrepression Rhen T and Cidlowski J A. NEJM 2005 353 1711 23 .

GCR antagonist or active agent therapy is helpful in patients with abnormally high levels of cortisol but maintained circadian rhythm over responsiveness to normal levels or high night time cortisol levels as a feature of disrupted circadian rhythm. Such altered cortisol physiology may relate to acute or chronic stress e.g. related to physical or psychological trauma or as an age related change in elderly individuals. Successful therapeutic use of such agents is thus often dependent on determining circadian cortisol levels either peak levels during the day e.g. at noon or measurements taken every 4 hours or 6 hours over a 24 hour period . This combined system of salivary cortisol quantification as an enabling device for its paired GCR antagonist will identify individuals for whom GCR antagonist or active agent therapy has a benefit.

The glucocorticoid receptor GR is expressed at high levels in some normal tissues but not in others. Likewise malignant tumors of diverse types and sites have variable GR expression. When present in normal or tumor benign or malignant tissues this GR expression may be variously located in some or all of their cellular sub compartments 1. stem cells 2. progenitor so called transit amplifying cell descendents of activated stem cells and 3. differentiated progeny of activated stem or progenitor cells.

The present invention therefore relates to the use of GR antagonists or active agents e.g. ORG34517 PT150 a relatively specific GR antagonist RU486 a non specific GR antagonist and others optionally in combination with at least one other agent for treating or preventing treatment resistant prostate cancer treating or preventing neoplasia and or treating or preventing infection related to acute or chronic injury or disease.

ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 are members of a class of therapeutic agents designed to block the glucocorticoid receptor GR acting as an antagonist for endogenous cortisol. Its primary developmental pathway has been as a treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases that are characterized by dysregulated signaling in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis often with higher than normal circulating levels of endogenous cortisol. Of particular note are the phase 2 clinical trials that have been completed for the treatment of psychotic depression. Other possible uses in this disease category which are under investigation include post traumatic stress disorder weight gain in patients requiring long term anti psychotic medication hospital delirium of the elderly etc. In addition the diverse data indicate a possible role for GR blockade as a means of promoting chemo sensitization of target tumors. Pre clinical trials demonstrate significant outcomes breast cancer growth slowed and reversed. These are pre clinical trials in which the company has successfully demonstrated the efficacy of a chemotherapy sensitizer for triple negative breast cancer ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.

The triple negative breast cancer is the most difficult to treat type of breast cancer and is indicated by the patient testing negative for estrogen receptor progesterone receptor and her 2 neu. The triple negative breast cancer is resistant to chemotherapy. Primary drug resistance and early onset of resistance are seen in other tumor types as well for example in liver and ovarian cancers where there is a significant unmet medical need for effective therapy. Chemotherapy is still a key approach to cancer treatment. Chemosensitizers would contribute to improve the efficacy of current therapeutic drugs and potentially improve their side effect profile. The world cancer market was estimated at 23 billion in 2004 and is expected to grow to at least 61 billion by 2013 with a CAGR of 14.7 .

The present invention provides a low cost rapid response diagnostic system to determine salivary cortisol levels in patients selected as potential candidates for GCR glucocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy utilizing a GCR antagonist or active agent such as ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The inventors have developed a saliva based diagnostic device for cortisol detection to accompany the development of ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as a therapeutic agent for multiple indications.

Clinical testing of cortisol levels in patients is a high cost laborious test that can be salivary or serum with samples taken from a patient and sent to a lab to await results. The cost and time factor for such tests has to date been prohibitive preventing the rapid quantitative determination necessary to assign treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor GCR antagonist due to the inability to make the determinations of cortisol levels at point of need or to monitor changes in cortisol as a measure of treatment response. By allowing the physician to determine the elevated cortisol level of a patient and in turn provide a therapeutic for such elevation at point of measurement the physician can qualify the best candidates suited for this type of therapeutic. The system also enables continual monitoring of the patient during treatment for assessment of responsiveness to treatment.

The present invention provides a system in which an apparatus uses a high void volume carrier to absorb sufficient amounts of saliva to then be placed into a reaction vessel with a reagent. The reagent is mixed with the sample and then is combined with for example a fluorescent ligand or pigment labeled ligand and placed into a device to determine salivary cortisol levels of the patient in less than 5 minutes in either a portable miniaturized fluorescence polarization reader in the former case or into a lateral flow device in the latter for measuring amounts of substrate in a small amount of fluid by direct or indirect methods.

The reader apparatus for example provides temperature control and on board mixing as an aid in viscosity control of the reaction to ensure better accuracy and precision.

The invention and method for non invasive sampling and detecting the presence of a biological substance of interest in a test sample of for example saliva or a bodily fluid combining said test sample with a buffering system Reagent 1 containing viscosity controllers and stabilizers in a reaction vessel mix solution well combining said test sample and buffering system mixture with a fluorescence labeled ligand Reagent 2 to said biological substance assay solution in a reaction vessel mix solution well and detecting a change of the assay solution in the fluorescence polarization reader or a pigment labeled ligand.

The ongoing development of the present invention has yielded new findings the thiosemicarbazone of ORG34517 could not be dimerized by treatment with sodium hydroxide NaOH. However in depth considerations indicated that this is in fact better for the goal to eliminate human hepatitis B and immunodeficiency proviruses since the crucial point is the binding mode on human glucocorticoid receptor hGR . It could be shown that the anticipated dimer would not bind to hGR. The thiosemicarbazone of ORG34517 could bind to hGR and force nuclear translocation of the ligand receptor complex. This is important since nuclear translocation is the prerequisite for our mode of action and the ORG34517 hGR complex itself does not translocate into the nucleus. In addition the thiosemicarbazone of ORG34517 will be activated to reactive sulfenic acid and carbodiimide metabolites by human flavin containing monooxygenases hFMO1 hFMO2.1 hFMO3 . The activation is achieved not by an activated bond in a putative dimer but by metabolic activation with human enzymes. In addition oxidative stress is enhanced in human hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus infected cells this might lead to enhanced activation in virus infected cells. The material PT155 is the complex of choice to be used in antiviral studies in vitro.

The present invention relates to the use of glucocorticoid receptor GCR antagonists or active agents e.g. ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof enabled by a device for rapidly sensitively specifically quantifying salivary cortisol levels as a surrogate for serum cortisol levels in a low cost manner. One purpose of this combination of inventions is to determine patients who have non normal cortisol produced by the adrenal cortex or disordered circadian rhythms as a method for selecting subjects for GCR antagonist or active agent therapy for whom it is likely to have beneficial and or therapeutic effects i.e. those with abnormal high levels but maintained circadian rhythm over responsiveness to normal levels high night time cortisol levels as a feature of disrupted circadian rhythm. The rapid sensitive and inexpensive test can also be used to monitor changes in cortisol levels in response to treatment in patients who have nonnormal cortisol produced by the adrenal cortex or disordered circadian rhythms as a method for selecting subjects for GCR antagonist or active agent therapy for whom it is likely to have beneficial and or therapeutic effects but also in patients having normal baseline cortisol at the start of treatment but for whom changing cortisol levels during treatment will indicate responsiveness to the GCR antagonist.

GCR antagonist or active agent therapy is helpful in patients with abnormally high levels of cortisol but maintained circadian rhythm over responsiveness to normal levels or high night time cortisol levels as a feature of disrupted circadian rhythm. Successful therapeutic use of such agents is thus dependent on determining circadian cortisol levels either peak levels during the day e.g. at noon or measurements taken every 4 hours or 6 hours over a 24 hour period .

The glucocorticoid receptor GR is expressed at high levels in some normal tissues but not in others. Likewise malignant tumors of diverse types and sites have variable GR expression. When present in normal or tumor benign or malignant tissues this GR expression may be variously located in some or all of their cellular subcompartments 1. stem cells 2. progenitor so called transit amplifying cell descendents of activated stem cells and 3. differentiated progeny of activated stem or progenitor cells.

As an example in the gastrointestinal tract GR are highly expressed in esophageal squamous epithelia hepatocytes and pancreatic islet cells but are not highly expressed in other gastrointestinal epithelia stomach small and large intestines pancreatic and biliary ducts . In corresponding malignancies arising in these epithelia hepatocellular carcinoma HCC and squamous cell carcinomas SCC of the esophagus have consistently highGR expression. Gastric and colorectal adenocarcinomas have little to no GR expression.

Dexamethasone DEX a binding activator of GR has been found to confer chemoresistance in oesophageal SCC and HCC cells suggesting that GR expression may be biologically important in some GR expressing carcinomas. This not only suggests why DEX or other glucocorticoids are not useful in treatment of these malignancies but it implies that endogenous circulating cortisol itself may actually promote chemoresi stance even in the absence of iatrogenic glucocorticoid administration. Therefore these findings suggest that blockade of GR within such malignant tumors by preventing activation by endogenous circulating cortisol can play a role in maintaining or promoting chemosensitivity and or treating neoplasia.

The present invention therefore relates to the use of GR antagonists or active agents e.g. ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the treatment of for example esophageal SCC and HCC or other tumors with high GR expression as a means of inhibiting promotion of chemoresi stance by endogenous cortisol. These effects may be present in all tumor cells or when tumors have stem or progenitor cell compartments these specifically as well. Thus the present invention relates to the inhibition of chemoprevention in the bulk of cells making up a given tumor and or in the rare stem progenitor cells within the tumor that are often responsible for tumor resistance to therapy and reoccurrence i.e. as a novel targeted cancer stem cell treatment.

To avoid possible negative side effects of systemic blockade of GR the present invention further relates to localized tumor treatment with GR antagonists through direct vascular infusion of tumor feeding vessels or by direct intratumoral injection.

The present invention relates to the use of GR antagonists for the treatment of for example breast and other cancers. The invention is based on the observation that GR inhibition will increase tumor cell susceptibility. GR antagonists will block anti apoptotic GR signaling in GR overexpressing breast cancer cells and subsequently render breast cancer cells more susceptible to conventional and novel cytotoxic therapies via blocking GR s pro cell survival signaling pathway .

The invention is directed to the use of for example a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist for preventive anti infective therapy after for example stroke and for the production of medicines and or pharmaceutical preparations for preventive anti infective therapy after stroke. Respiratory tract infections ranged from 1 33 after stroke and urinary tract infections ranged from 2 27 . These infections have a high impact on morbidity and mortality. The 30 day mortality rate in patients with pneumonia is 27 while the mortality rate is 4 in stroke patients without pneumonia. Also the disability in stroke patients with pneumonia is higher than in patients without resulting in increased medical costs and a lower quality of life. It is ethically and medically preferred to prevent or treat the post stroke infections. Presently trials of antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of post stroke infections are underway.

The term early preventive anti infective therapy after stroke means that the treatment is started within 72 hours after the stroke event.

The glucocorticoid receptor is widely distributed and expressed in many cultured cell lines and the control of gene expression by glucocorticoids therefore has been widely studied as a model for transcriptional regulation.

A number of glucocorticoid responsive transcription units including mouse mammary tumor virus MMTV Ringold et al. 1975 Parks et al. 1974 mouse and human metallothionein Eager et al. 1981 Karin et al. 1980 rat alpha.sub.2M globulin Kurtz et al. 1977 and rat and human growth hormone Spindler et al. 1982 Evans et al. 1982 Robins et al. 1982 genes have been identified. DNA sequences mediating transcriptional stimulation of several of these genes have been localized. For MMTV these sequences are discrete genomic regions upstream of the transcriptional start site which appear to exert their actions independently of orientation and position Chandler et al. 1983 Ostrowski et al. 1984 . The steroid receptor complex appears to bind to these regulatory sequences and purified receptor has been used to define the specific binding sites Govinda et al. 1982 Scheidereit et al. 1983 Pfahl 1982 Payvar et al. 1983 . The ability of the glucocorticoid responsive element GRE to alter its position and orientation yet still maintain promoter inducibility suggests that it resembles the class of cis acting regulatory sequences termed enhancers Chandler et al. 1983 . First discovered in viruses and subsequently in cellular genes these sequences are necessary for efficient transcription in vivo Laimonis et al. 1982 Benoist et al. 1981 Baerji et al. 1983 .

It has been suggested that enhancers are recognized by trans acting factors that mediate regulatory effects by tissue specific transcriptional control. Although the enhancer factors have not been well characterized the glucocorticoid receptor may serve as a paradigm for these putative gene activator proteins.

It is generally accepted that the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor GR resides in the cytoplasm and that hormone activation leads both to nuclear accumulation and gene activation. Gasc J. M. Baulieu E. E. 1987 in Steroid Hormone Receptors Their Intracellular Localisation ed. Clark C. R. Ellis Horwood Ltd. Chichester England pp. 233 250 Beato M. 1989 Cell 56 335 344 Carson Jurica M. A. Schrader W. T. OMalley B. W. 1990 Endocr. Rev. 11 201 220 Gronemeyer H. 1993 in Steroid Hormone Action ed. Parker M. G. Oxford University Press New York pp. 94 117 Tsai M. J. OMalley B. W. 1994 Annu. Rev. Biochem. 63 451 486 Akner G. Wikstrom A. C. Gustafsson J. A. 1995 J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 52 1 16 and references therein. However the mechanisms involved in nuclear translocation and targeting of steroid receptors to regulatory sites in chromatin have been poorly understood. It has previously been difficult to discriminate between the ability of a given receptor mutant or a given receptor ligand combination to participate in the separate processes of receptor activation nuclear translocation sequence specific binding and promoter activation.

The glucocorticoid receptor GR is expressed in a subset of both ERalpha positive and negative human breast cancers as well as in other malignancies such as some ovarian cancers hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that activation of the GR in ER negative pre malignant breast epithelial and cancer cells initiates cell survival pathways under stress conditions that normally induce significant cell death e.g. chemotherapy radiation growth factor deprivation .

The glucocorticoid receptor GR is present in glucocorticoid responsive cells where it resides in the cytosol in an inactive state until it is stimulated by an agonist. Upon stimulation the glucocorticoid receptor translocates to the cell nucleus where it specifically interacts with DNA and or protein s and regulates transcription in a glucocorticoid responsive manner. Two examples of proteins that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor are the transcription factors API and NFkappa B. Such interactions result in inhibition of API and NFkappa B mediated transcription and are believed to be responsible for some of the anti inflammatory activity of endogenously administered glucocorticoids. In addition glucocorticoids may also exert physiologic effects independent of nuclear transcription. Biologically relevant glucocorticoid receptor agonists include cortisol and corticosterone. Many synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonists exist including dexamethasone prednisone and prednisolone.

Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists bind to the receptor and prevent glucocorticoid receptor agonists from binding and eliciting GR mediated events including transcription. RU486 is an example of a non selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist.

Compounds having high glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and in addition high in vivo antiglucocorticoid activity while having for example low androgenic and progestagenic activities are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 011 025 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. ORG 34517 PT150 is an example of a compound with high glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity while having low androgenic and progestagenic activities show specific and high glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and are highly active in vivo showing predominant anti glucocorticoid activity.

The compounds lack appreciable affinity for mineralocorticoid progesterone estrogen and androgen receptors indicating a clean side effect profile.

The specificity of ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for GR blockade without significant cross binding to other related steroidal hormone receptors such as those for estrogen and progesterone eliminates the likelihood of significant toxicities and side effects. Indeed none were identified in all the substantial phase I and phase II clinical trials that already have been performed with the PT150 compound. Because the drug is envisioned as being used in limited dosing over time coordinated with the intermittent dosing strategies typical for chemotherapeutic agents the GR blockade also would not lead to significant alteration of HPA axis functioning with rapid restitution of the HPA axis to baseline following dosing.

The enantiomer of PT150 ent PT150 and of PT155 ent PT155 stand as being representative for the corresponding unnatural enantiomers of the steroid parts in PT155 PT156 PT157and PT158. We claim the unnatural enantiomers and all possible existing steroidal diastereomers of the steroid parts in PT155 PT156 PT157and PT158 as a subject of the art.

PT153 is an inclusion complex of one molecule ORG34517 guest with two molecules ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone host . PT153 is formed by refluxing ORG34517 in 90 v v aqueous ethanol with an excess of thiosemicarbazide H2N NH C S NH2 . The product is precipitated by addition of water or freezing.

In depth analysis of the reaction product revealed that the product PT153 consisted of two molecules ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone and one unreacted molecule of ORG34517 in conjunction with the solvents ethanol 1.52 and water 1.25 which could not being removed by prolonged vacuum drying over anhydrous calcium chloride CaCl2 

The ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone part is a cis trans stereoisomeric mixture Z E mixture with 71.8 E stereoisomer trans and 28.2 Z stereoisomer cis 

The proton nuclear magnetic resonance H NMR spectrum clearly resolved the three molecular species E thiosemicarbazone Z thiosemicarbazone ORG34517 contained in PT153. This composition was clearly confirmed by elemental analysis combustion analysis of elemental CHNS O content 

The E Z stereoisomerism resulting from hindered rotation about thioamide groups HN C S is well known for thiosemicarbazones. The nature of the inclusion complex will be revealed in the discussion of the structure of PT154.

An important feature of PT153 is the strongly electrostatic nature of its powder form. The powder of PT153 is so inductively magnetic that it poses considerable difficulties in grounding powdering and dosage. The powder jumps from every spatula when grounded. Taken together this magnetic nature of PT153 poses considerable difficulties in pharmaceutical formulation. As will be shown PT154 does not exhibit this peculiar phenomenon in such intensity.

PT154 is a purified inclusion complex of one molecule ORG34517 guest with two molecules ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone host .

To synthesize a putative dimer PT153 was treated with a molar excess of aqueous sodium hydroxide NaOH in acetone at room temperature. The product PT154 was precipitated by addition of water and freezing. The model reaction for this experiment was the dimerization of a retinoid thiosemicarbazone published in 2011.

In depth analysis of the reaction product revealed that the product PT154 consisted of two molecules ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone and one unreacted molecule of ORG34517 in conjunction with the solvents ethanol 1 diacetone alcohol 0.24 and water 0.8 which could not being removed by prolonged vacuum drying over anhydrous calcium chloride CaCl . The diacetone alcohol resulted from the well known base catalysed dimerization of the reaction solvent acetone 2HC C O CH HC C OH CH C O CH . Diacetone alcohol is a relatively non toxic solvent also found as a natural product in sleepy grass syn. .

The ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone part in PT154 was analyzed to be exactly the same cis trans stereoisomeric mixture as in PT153 Z E mixture with 71.8 E stereoisomer trans and 28.2 Z stereoisomer cis .

The proton nuclear magnetic resonance H NMR spectrum clearly resolved the three molecular species E thiosemicarbazone Z thiosemicarbazone ORG34517 contained in PT154 see Experimental section . This composition was clearly confirmed by elemental analysis combustion analysis of elemental CHNS O content 

This striking analogy of PT154 to PT153 is remarkable since complete dissolution treatment with base and precipitation leads almost invariantly to a change in composition and stereoisomeric proportions. Furthermore a sodium salt should have been formed from the ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone. Nothing of these changes happened at all. This strongly pointed to a complex formation inclusion compound of ORG34517 in an ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone molecular lattice. The ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone exhibits a thiourea grouping and thiourea is well known for its ability to build macromolecular inclusion compounds so called clathrates. Therefore it is assumed that PT153 and PT154 are in fact stable inclusion compounds of one molecule ORG34517 guest with two molecules ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone host .

The reasons for this assumption are i the exactly analogous composition of PT153 and PT154 despite of PT153 s treatment with base and re precipitation to yield PT154 ii the thiourea structural element in PT153 and PT154 enables thiourea like inclusion compounds as exemplified by the hexamethylenetetramine inclusion complex with thiourea ratio 1 2 and iii the existence of steroidal inclusion compounds as exemplified by cholesterol guest with deoxycholate host according to Nobel laureate Heinrich Wieland.

The most suitable explanation for the interaction of one molecule ORG34517 guest with two molecules ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone host is the published observation of complex formation of testosterone with hippuric acid or also phenyl urethane acetanilide acetamide all in ratio 1 2 . Also deoxycorticosterone 21 hydroxypregn 4 ene 3 20 dione or dehydro epi androsterone 3 O acetate 3 3 acetyloxy androst 5 en 17 one form complexes with hippuric acid both in ratio 1 2 . This means that 3 keto steroids like ORG34517 can form addition compounds with amide or thioamide presenting compounds in ratio 1 2. Very interestingly thiourea complexes with pyridinium halides 2 1 can exhibit ferroelectric dielectric properties in the case of pyridinium iodide thiourea 1 2 . This might be an explanation for the electrostatic magnetic nature of PT153.

PT155 is an inclusion complex of choice of for example one molecule ORG34517 guest on three molecules ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone host . In exemplary embodiments the ratio of ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone to ORG34517 is for example 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1 or 1 1.

In an experiment aimed at forcing the reaction in direction of ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone the reflux time was doubled from 30 min to 1 h. Only a similar inclusion complex as contained in PT153 and PT154 could be isolated. It is concluded that ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone and ORG34517 interact strongly as previously postulated. The ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone part of PT155 is a Z E mixture with 71.8 E stereoisomer and 28.2 Z stereoisomer. This material PT155 is the complex of choice to be used in antiviral studies in vitro. The metabolic activation of ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone contained in PT153 155 S Oxidation by human flavin containing monooxygenases hFMOs .

It is well known that thiosemicarbazones like thiacetazone p acetamidobenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone a cheap second line antitubercular substance discovered by Nobel laureate Gerhard Domagk in 1946 are bio activated by human flavin containing monooxygenases hFMO1 hFMO2.1 hFMO3 into a sulfenic acid R S OH a sulfinic acid R S O OH and a carbodiimide derivative R N C N H 23 24 

Both the sulfenic acid and the carbodiimide derivative are the active antitubercular metabolites. The sulfinic acid bottom left does not form the carbodiimide and represents an inactive metabolite. Especially the carbodiimide derivative can react with amino acid residues in target proteins of for example or with human hepatic extrahepatic glutathione R SH thiol mercapto group for metabolic detoxification 

Slightly modified citation The hFMOs oxygenate nucleophilic heteroatom containing chemicals and drugs and generally converts them into harmless polar readily excreted metabolites. Sometimes however FMO bioactivates chemicals into reactive materials that can cause toxicity. Most of the interindividual differences of hFMOs are due to genetic variability and allelic variation and splicing variants may contribute to interindividual and interethnic variability observed for hFMO mediated metabolism. In contrast to cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP450 monooxygenases hFMOs are not easily induced nor readily inhibited and potential adverse drug drug interactions are minimized for drugs prominently metabolized by hFMOs. These properties may provide advantages in drug design and discovery and by incorporating hFMO detoxication pathways into drug candidates more drug like materials may be forthcoming. Although exhaustive examples are not available physiological factors can influence hFMO function and this may have implications for the clinical significance of hFMOs and a role in human disease. 

PT155 exhibits magnetism is of electrostatic type and is called the triboelectric effect. The triboelectric effect also known as triboelectric charging is a type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged after they come into frictional contact with a different material. Rubbing glass with fur or a comb through the hair can build up triboelectricity. Most everyday static electricity is triboelectric. The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials surface roughness temperature strain and other properties.

PT156 is formed by refluxing ORG34517 in 90 v v aqueous ethanol with a slight excess of 4 phenylthiosemicarbazide H2N NH C S NH C6H5 . The product is precipitated by addition of water and freezing. Analysis of the reaction product revealed that the present invention PT156 contained 17 l of an unreacted molecule of ORG34517 in conjunction with the solvent water 17 11 which could not being removed by prolonged vacuum drying over anhydrous calcium chloride CaCl2 . The ORG34517 4 phenylthiosemicarbazone part is a cis trans stereoisomeric mixture Z E mixture with 74.1 E stereoisomer trans and 25.9 Z stereoisomer cis .

The Metabolic Activation of ORG34517 4 Phenylthiosemicarbazone Contained in PT156 Para Oxidation by Human Cytochrome P450 Monoxygenases

It is well known that acetanilide is oxidized by human cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 1A2 CYP1A2 isoenzyme in para position of the phenyl ring to yield paracetamol acetaminophen 29 and is further oxidized by CYP3A4 to N acetyl p benzoquinone imine 

Analogously PT156 could be activated by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in T lymphocytes to This represents an additional activation mechanism for PT156 which is not achieved with and incorporated in PT155. It is especially important for the potential treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS with PT compounds since in human blood lymphocytes only very low levels of human flavin containing monooxygenases only hFMO4 and hFMO5 could be detected. Even in absence of human flavin containing monooxygenases PT156 could be activated in human T lymphocytes since microsomal cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2 and 3A4 were readily detected in human blood lymphocytes. Historically the overall metabolism of acetanilide was elucidated by Brodie Axelrod in 1948.

PT150 formerly known as ORG34517 was first developed by Organon as a drug therapy for major depressive disorder Gallagher Young 2006 . In 2007 it was acquired by Schering Plough then by Merck Co. and ultimately was acquired by Pop Test Cortisol LLC in December of 2010. As ORG34517 it has undergone two Phases of Clinical Trials for safety 

PT155 was developed from PT150 based on observations that thiosemicarbazones exhibit considerable antiviral activities including activities versus hepatitis C virus and Ebola virus Zaire Kesel 2011 Kesel et al. 2014 .

The 3 UTR is critical to viral replication in the host and interacts with a large number of host proteins Roby 2014 including Mov34 which has been demonstrated to be involved in transcription and translation in mouse Ta Vrati 2000 . The PMSD7 gene product a Mov34 related gene is a subunit in the proteasome. Mov34 has been demonstrated to bind to the genome of the Japanese Encephalitis Virus Ta Vrati 2000 . Alterations in the proteasomal processing of NF B is a major regulatory point for the production of pro inflammatory cytokines and in controlling the immune response microbial and viral pathogens have been documented to alter this pathway to promote infection Rahman McFadden 2011 . Additionally Mov34 contains an MPN domain which is highly conserved in eukaryotic initiation factors in the 3A family Asano 1997 Sanches 2007 .

Without being bound to any theory one possible mechanism of action for compounds PT150 and PT155 is rooted in their activity as glucocorticoid receptor GR antagonists. The GR agonist dexamethasone and the GR antagonist mifepristone RU38486 have been demonstrated to interact with Mov34 in HIV 1 infection Ramanathan et al. 2002 and either promote or inhibit translocation to the nucleus. The disruption of interactions between Mov34 like proteins and the 3 UTR region of Zika and likely other Flavivirus suppress viral replication and negate sfRNA mediated cellular events necessary for successful viral infection. This hypothesis is further supported by the patents WO 2004 112720 A2 ND US 2007 0259844 A1 Kim 2004 Kim 2007 for antiviral compositions against the human hepatitis C virus.

PT150 is a new class of therapeutic agents designed to block the glutocorticoid receptor GR acting as an antagonist for endogenous cortisol. PT150 or 11 17 11 1 3 benzodioxol 5 yl 17 hydroxy 17 1 propynyl estra 4 9 dien 3 one is the first selective GR antagonist studied in a Phase I program in healthy human subjects ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00226278 for its safety tolerability and pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic characteristics. It showed no prohibitive effects in the first in human studies. It has significantly higher selectivity for the GR compared to mifeprestone RU486 . PT150 and mifepristone bound to cytosolic GRs with values of 365 and 193 respectively values for the cytosolic progesterone receptors PR however were 6.4 and 36 respectively. This suggests that PT150 has a selectivity ratio GR PR of 57 compared to 5.4 for mifeprestone. In the pregnancy interruption test in rats twice daily administration of 4 mg kgpo PT150 and 1 2 mg kgpo mifepristone produced similar results nearly 100 embryos lost confirming the lower anti progestational activity of PT150 as compared to mifeprestone. Therefore the specificity of PT150 for GR blockade without significant cross binding to other related steroidal hormone receptors such as those for estrogen and discretely progesterone eliminate the likelihood of significant toxicities and side effects. In contrast to mifeprestone PT150 was able to block corticosterone induced GR translocation. This suggests that PT150 is a true competitive GR antagonist without partial agonistic activities Peeters et al. 2008 .

GR expression has not shown prognostic value in Kaplan Meier survival and residual survival analysis or overall survival in ovarian cancer patients Woenchhaus et al. 2006 . Nonetheless administration of GC along with apoptosis inducing chemotherapies to ovarian cancer patients inhibited cell death and activation of anti apoptotic genes SGK1 MKP 1 DUSP 1 and caspase inhibitor cIAP2 in ovarian tissues suggesting an overall decrease in the effectiveness of chemotherapy Runnebaum Bruning 2005 Melhem et al. 2009 .

The following virus taken from the NIAID Merging Pathogens List are Flavivirus which PT150 and PT155 have the potential to treat.

Test results to date have two identified problems that we believe are obscuring antiviral results. Firstly many of the cell lines used in testing are immortal cell lines. Secondly not all of the cell lines tested contain active glucocorticoid receptors which play a role in compound interaction for antiviral activity.

Phase II Clinical of PT150 dosed patients at 900 mg per day for 2 weeks with no noted adverse indications of cell toxicity. Yet cytotoxicity is showing up for in vitro models. PT discovered that PT150 has value as a chemosensitizing agent in the treatment of cancer. As such it has a demonstrable effect on cancerous cells. Unfortunately this includes most cell lines utilized for in vitro testing.

Take for example the observable differences in cytotoxicity when PT150 is used in the Zika assay in HeLa cells breast tumor derived cell line HUH7 liver tumor cell line and HFF human foreskin fibroblasts non tumor derived . The 50 cellular toxicity in primary human foreskin fibroblasts is far greater than 150 M these cells are very sensitive sensors of toxicity on human tissue.

Vero derived cell lines Vero Vero 76 Vero E6 do not contain human glucocorticoid receptors as they are derived from African green monkey epithelial kidney cells. They even do not even contain a glucocorticoid receptor Dreyer et al. 1989 and have been demonstrated to be completely unresponsive to dexamethasone. As such seeing no activity on an antiviral assay for Flavivirus is not surprising. We believe the choice of cell line obscured potential positive results for PT150 and PT155 assays. Re assay in a cell line that contains a glucocorticoid receptor preferably a human one is likely to yield compound activity

The Zika virus has been demonstrated to be sexually transmissible through semen in multiple studies. The RNA virus can be detected in semen up to 62 days after the beginning of infection. Hill et al. 2016 Mansuy et al. 2016 McCarthy 2016 . This provides not only an infection route for the virus which is independent of an arthropod vector but also exceeds the current WHO guidelines for engaging in protected sex for 30 days after returning from an endemically infected area Turmel et al. 2016 .

The persistence of Zika in semen offers an opportunity to conduct clinical testing in an arena which avoids the issues of birth defects with testing in pregnant women or women seeking to become pregnant.

Anti PS binding of a molecule to viral envelope PS will therefore interfere with acute infection by any of the above named viruses with acute reactivation of a latent chronic viral infection in those PS labeled viruses capable of maintaining latency or with chronic viral infection with active viral replication of any of the above named viruses.

The anti viral actions of PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY 1 or any further derivatives therefore may act on any viral infection through more than one mechanism of action either through binding to GREs with all the possible anti viral activities noted above or to PS with all possible anti viral activities noted above in an additive or synergistic fashion.

In addition inhibition of Hsp90 by small molecule drugs for example geldanamycin radicicol derivatives represents an established antineoplastic chemotherapeutic strategy. Hsp90 client proteins 300 cellular proteins are known currently to be Hsp90 clients are important for cancer growth and malignant transformation. PT compounds especially PT150 indirectly target Hsp90 by trapping Hsp90 in an inactive complex with human glucocorticoid receptor isoform alpha. This in turn leads to diminished availability of Hsp90 protein required for stabilizing client proteins essential to cancer cell growth maintenance of malignant cell phenotype tumor angiogenesis tumor spread and metastasis.

PT150 and PT155 are antivirally active versus Rift Valley fever virus replication at relatively low concentrations EC50 10 M . PT150 is about as active as PT155

This antiviral activity is clearly independent of human glucocorticoid receptor a hGRa since Vero 76 cells do not express such a receptor even not any monkey glucocorticoid receptor.

The mechanism of action is very probably inhibition of virus cell fusion since RVFV glycoprotein GC contains a binding pocket for lipophilic compounds.

This was substantiated by the observation that the RVFV accessory proteins the 78 kDa protein NSm1 NSm2 and NSs are dispensable for virus replication in vitro and the postulation that the PT compounds do not interact with the large RNA dependent RNA polymerase L and the nucleocapsid protein N. Other gene expression products are not known therefore PT compounds should bind to GN and or GC RVFV envelope transmembrane glycoproteins mediating receptor binding and fusion

Binding of PT compounds to the nucleocapsid N protein is not expected since the RVFV N protein does not present hydrophobic binding sites only a central RNA binding core hence positively charged and alternately charged N and C termini.

A binding pocket for highly lipophilic compounds in the X ray crystallographic structure of RVFV GC protein was described. GC is the fusion competent glycoprotein and represents a class II viral fusion glycoprotein.

PT150 and PT155 are antivirally active versus poliovirus type 3 replication at low concentrations EC50 1 5 M . PT155 is slightly more active than PT150

Poliomyelitis is an old disease see picture . Poliovirus can infect neurons and can lead to neuromuscular paralysis.

The term poliomyelitis is used to identify the disease caused by any of the three serotypes of poliovirus. Two basic patterns of polio infection are described a minor illness which does not involve the central nervous system CNS sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis and a major illness involving the CNS which may be paralytic or nonparalytic.

PT150 and PT155 are antivirally active versus poliovirus type 3 replication at low concentrations EC50 1 5 M . PT155 is slightly more active than PT150

This antiviral activity is clearly independent of human glucocorticoid receptor a hGRa since Vero 76 cells do not express such a receptor even not any monkey glucocorticoid receptor.

The mechanism of action is very probably inhibition of poliovirus capsid uncoating since PT150 fits well into the picornaviral VP1 capsid protein hydrophobic pocket binder model like do the canyon binders compound 40 arildone disoxaril WIN 58084 pleconaril and pirodavir. For a model of this hydrophobic binding of PT150 into the VP1 pocket of human rhinovirus 14 see next side. A similar fit of PT150 is expected into poliovirus type 3 VP1 capsid protein hydrophobic pocket.

ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 are anew class of therapeutic agents designed to block the glucocorticoid receptor GR acting as an antagonist for endogenous cortisol. The primary developmental pathway to date has been as a treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases characterized by dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis of signaling that are often associated with higher than normal circulating levels of endogenous cortisol.

Other possible uses include oncology viral infection and other neuropsychiatric conditions including post traumatic stress disorder weight gain in patients requiring long term anti psychotic medication and hospital delirium of the elderly.

Human hepatitis B virus HBV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV 1 integrate their retro transcribed DNA proviruses into the human host genome. Existing antiretroviral drug regimens fail to directly target these intrachromosomal xenogenomes leading to persistence of viral genetic information. Both HBV and HIV 1 harbor glucocorticoid response elements GREs in their proviral DNA genomes. This invention describes a potent glucocorticoid antagonist which binds to human glucocorticoid receptor isoform alpha hGR alpha is translocated to the nucleus by the nuclear receptor dimer and has the ability to covalently inactivate the intragenic and intraexonic viral GREs of HBV and HIV 1. The glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative described by this invention represents the first reported antiviral agent capable of eradicating human immunodeficiency and hepatitis B proviruses from their human host.

The anti HBV effect of the glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative may be mediated by hGR alpha since the HBV genome contains at least two hGR alpha trans activation targets GREs . The glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative binds to hGR alpha is transported through the nuclear pore complex to the intranuclear HBV genome by the glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative liganded hGR alpha the liganded hGR alpha complex binds to GREs and finally the co transported glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative switches to the HBV DNA and covalently modifies amine group containing nucleobases cytosine guanine adenine by trans thiocarbamoylation. This could also happen for host cellular GREs but we think there is selectivity for intraexonic GREs which are not typical for the human genome since viral intraexonic GREs are subject to different epigenetic regulation involving chromatin remodeling events in comparison to host cellular GREs. Human GREs are located in the promoter regions upstream of transcription initiation sites with only few exceptions where the GRE is found within a human gene intron. Additionally it should be mentioned that human GREs are in most instances imperfect GRE sequence degeneracy i.e. their sequences do not match the perfect GRE consensus sequence given. In spite of these imperfect GRE sites their glucocorticoid responsiveness is retained.

GRE 4 is proposed as a target of the glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative since the 5 LTR GREs are only partially functional negative enhancers silencers of HIV 1 gene expression whereas the GRE 4 in the vif gene was shown to be fully functional as enhancer of HIV gene transcription.

The covalent modification of HIV 1vif gene by the glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative in close analogy to the already described mechanism of action on HBV ayw would lead to loss of HIV 1Vif protein Vif viral infectivity factor function. Vif protein serves as an inherent retroviral inhibitor of the innate human apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme 3G APOBEC3G dependent human antiretroviral defense system. As a consequence Vif could not protect HIV 1 cDNA towards host APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase enzymatic activity dC dU mutation .

The covalently trapped proviral DNA of HBV or HIV 1 is expected to induce p53 mediated apoptosis through an DNA damage signal mechanism sensored by p53 tumor suppressor protein and or other DNA damage induced sensor mechanisms e.g. ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein ATR . By proviral DNA damage induced apoptosis the host organism of the viruses could be successively cleared from host genome integrated proviral xeno DNA.

The synthesis of the glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative is performed by construction of the thiosemicarbazone of ORG34517 20 min reflux of ORG34517 with equimolar thiosemicarbazide in 90 v v aqueous ethanol and its subsequent dimerization by treatment in acetone room temperature with sodium hydroxide NaOH pre dissolved in water . These transactions are based on general procedures already described in literature and known to those skilled in the art.

The hitherto claimed compounds of this invention could also be active versus human hepatitis C virus HCV which is indicated by a published proof of concept study. An antiviral mechanism of action of the glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative and of the intermediate ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone versus human hepatitis C virus subtype 1b strain Con1 HCV 1b Con1 is proposed. It is inherently clear that it cannot being mediated by hGR alpha since HCV incorporates no DNA stage in its life cycle. Since the anti HCV 1b activity of thiosemicarbazones described in this invention was determined with the HCV RNA replicon cell line Huh7 ET luc ubi neo ET which only codes for the non structural HCV proteins NS3 NS4A NS4B NS5A and NS5B the inhibiting action of the thiosemicarbazones described in this invention must be confined to these five genes and or gene products. It was reported that thiosemicarbazones 5 6 dimethoxyindan 1 one thiosemicarbazone DMI TSC target bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 BVDV 1 strain NADL Flaviviridae Pestivirus NS5B protein RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp . BVDV 1 is commonly regarded as a suitable surrogate for HCV because both Flaviviridae polyprotein sequences are closely related maximal sequence identity 39 

Since the claimed compounds of this invention could also be active versus Ebola virus Zaire strain 1976 Mayinga EBOV Zaire 1976 Mayinga which is indicated by a published proof of concept study a sequence triple alignment between BVDV 1 NADL NS5B RdRp HCV 1b Con1 NS5B RdRp and EBOV Zaire 1976 Mayinga VP40 membrane associated matrix protein is included in this invention. A compound similar to the claimed compounds of this invention is an inhibitor of EBOV Zaire 1976 Mayinga membrane associated matrix protein VP40 octamerization an event which is essential to EBOV Zaire 1976 Mayinga replication.

The invention provides the treatment of EBOV Zaire infections with the glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative or the intermediate ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone both embodiments of this invention as the procedures described in this invention are known to those skilled in the art.

The invention provides the combination of ORG34517 dimeric thiosemicarbazone derivative with additional anti viral and anti inflammatory compounds in a kit for the treatment or amelioration of a condition selected from the group consisting of HBV infection HIV infection and Ebola virus infection.

PT155 is metabolically activated by human flavin containing monoxygenases hFMOs through S oxidation in the thiosemicarbazone part of PT155

The PT155carbodiimide metabolite binds as ligand to the homodimeric hGR a b in one half with ORG 34517 and the liganded complex translocates to the nucleus 

The hGRa b PT155carbodiimide metabolite complex binds to GREs in intrachromosomal HBV or HIV 1 proviral DNA

The HBV or HIV 1 host DNA integrated proviral GRE DNA is thereby covalently inactivated over an amidrazone bond

The covalently trapped proviral DNA of HBV or HIV 1 is expected to induce p53 mediated apoptos is through an DNA damage signal mechanism sensored by p53 tumor suppressor protein and or other DNA damage induced sensor mechanisms e.g.ataxiatelangiectasiaandRad3 relatedprotein ATR By proviral DNA damage induced apoptosis the host organism of the viruses could be successively cleared from host genome integrated proviral xeno DNA Human hepatitis B virus HBV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV 1 integrate the irretro transcribed DNA proviruses into the human host genome. Existing antiretroviral drug regimens fail to directly target these intrachromosomal xeno genomes leading to persistence of viral genetic information Existing HAART therapies target reverse transcriptase HBV HIV protease HIV and integrase HIV proteins. These therapy options are not curative In a proof of concept study the PT155 similar compound retinazone was proved to work versus HBV HIV 1 HCV and the human herpes viruses HHV 3 HHV 5 HHV 6 and HHV 8 Herpes viridae Retinazone s antiviral activity correlated exactly with the presence of intragenic and intraexonic GREs in virus essential genes of retinazone susceptible viruses The glucocorticoid antagonist ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone derivative PT155 described in this presentation might represent the first reported antiviral agent capable of eradicating human immunodeficiency and hepatitis B proviruses from their human host Human hepatitis C virus HCV NS5B RNA polymerase protein bears a common thiosemicarbazone binding motif HCV 1b Con1 NS5B fingertip finger domain RdRp motif I 139 MAKNEV 144 Hepaciviruscompletely conserved aa residues in bold was identified as thiosemicarbazone binding motif In a proof of concept study structurally diverse thiosemicarbazones were active as inhibitors of HCV replication PT155 is additionally proposed as HCV inhibitor HIV The Mechanism of Action of PT150 and PT155 Versus Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Strain LAI Retroviridae Lentivirus Results 

PT150 and PT155 are active versus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV 1 strain LAI HIV 1 in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs which consist of T lymphocytes B lymphocytes and monocytes. HIV 1 HIV 1 LAV 1 was assayed in primary freshly donated from healthy tested HIV 1 negative HBV negative and HCV negative blood donors and isolated by single step Ficoll Hypaque centrifugation method human peripheral blood mononuclear PBM cells in the presence of a drug being evaluated. The parameter for antiviral activity was reduction of reverse transcriptase RT activity in the cell supernatant after Triton X 100 mediated lysis of released virions as measured by Salpha H dTTP 5alpha tritiated thymidine 5 triphosphate incorporation into poly rA poly dT directed by the primed RNA template poly rA oligo dT . It should be noted that the assay did not detect RT inhibition by potential RT inhibitors per se but indirectly quantified the amount of released HIV 1 in the supernatant. The detailed assay methodology was reported by Schinazi et al. as based on an older assay system of Spira et al. The experiments were conducted in triplicate and treated statistically by regression curve analysis rcoefficient of determination . The RT inhibitor AZT zidovudine 3 azido 3 deoxythymidine RETROVIR served as a positive control. Cytotoxicity on PBMC exerted by the test compounds was determined as described by Stuyver et al. by application of the CellTiter 96 AQOne Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Promega Corp. Madison Wis. . Briefly the phenazine ethosulfate PES coupled reduction of the tetrazolium salt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 5 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl 2H tetrazolium MTS to a purple formazan by undamaged cells was measured.

The antiretroviral action of PT150 and PT155 is mediated via DNA glucocorticoid response elements GREs residing in the prolentivirus of HIV 1integrated into the nuclear chromosomal human host genome as xenogenomic prolentiviral DNA sequence 

PT155 is metabolically activated by human flavin containing monoxygenases hFMOs through S oxidation in the thiosemicarbazone part of PT155.

The PT155 carbodiimide metabolite binds as ligand to the homodimeric hGRalpha in one half with PT150 and the liganded complex translocates to the nucleus 

hGRalpha subunit 1 PT155 carbodiimide metabolite hGRalphasubunit 2 PT150 The hGRalpha PT155 carbodiimide metabolite complex binds to GREs in intrachromosomal HIV 1 proviral DNA

It is well known that thiosemicarbazones like thiacetazone p acetamidobenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone a cheap second line antitubercular substance discovered by Nobel laureate Gerhard Domagk in 1946 are bio activated by human flavin containing monooxygenases hFMO1 hFMO2.1 hFMO3 into a sulfenic acid R S OH a sulfinic acid R S O OH and a carbodiimide derivative R N C N H . Both the sulfenic acid and the carbodiimide metabolite are the active antitubercular metabolites. The sulfinic acid does not form the carbodiimide and represents an inactive metabolite. Especially the carbodiimide metabolite can react with amino acid residues in target proteins of for example or with human hepatic extrahepatic glutathione R SH thiol group for metabolic detoxification 

Therefore PT155 will be bio activated S oxidized in the same manner as thiacetazone by hFMOs under consumption of molecular oxygen O and will be able to bind covalently to HBV and HIV proviral GRE DNA after being shuttled to the host cell nucleus by hGRalpha.

Human flavin dependent monooxygenases hFMOs EC 1.14.13.8 are the second important type of monooxygenases in the human body the other well known type being the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP450 monooxygenases . Both are localized in microsomes and dependent on molecular oxygen O and hFMOs need also the cofactors flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH whereas CYP450 monooxygenases are heme dependent. hFMO1 is mainly expressed in human kidney and to a smaller extent in small intestine and lung. hFMO2 is expressed to a very high level in human lung and kidney and to a smaller extent in liver and small intestine. hFMO3 and hFMO5 are highly expressed in human liver but are also expressed in lung and to a smaller extent in human kidney. hFMO4 is mainly expressed in kidney and to a smaller extent in liver and small intestine. hFMO5 is also expressed to a high level in small intestine. hFMO2 is additionally expressed in human brain but at low abundance 

 The hFMOs oxygenate nucleophilic heteroatom containing chemicals and drugs and generally converts them into harmless polar readily excreted metabolites. Sometimes however FMO bioactivates chemicals into reactive materials that can cause toxicity. Most of the interindividual differences of hFMOs are due to genetic variability and allelic variation and splicing variants may contribute to interindividual and interethnic variability observed for hFMO mediated metabolism. In contrast to cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP450 monooxygenases hFMOs are not easily induced nor readily inhibited and potential adverse drug drug interactions are minimized for drugs prominently metabolized by hFMOs. These properties may provide advantages in drug design and discovery and by incorporating hFMO detoxication pathways into drug candidates more drug like materials may be forthcoming. Although exhaustive examples are not available physiological factors can influence hFMO function and this may have implications for the clinical significance of hFMOs and a role in human disease. 

Implications of the Structure of PT155 on Nuclear Receptor Binding Nuclear Translocation as Key to Biological Action of PT155 

PT150 does not support nuclear translocation of the PT150 hGRalpha complex. It is a competitive antagonist to cortisol in the cytosol only. Therefore to reach our goal to target HBV and HIV proviruses residing in eukaryotic cell nuclear chromatin we must force nuclear translocation. Nuclear translocation of glucocorticosteroid hGR complexes relies on structural modalities. The RU38486 RU486 mifepristone RU486 hGRalpha complex is indeed translocated into the nucleus since RU486 represents a partial agonist at hGRalpha. The residual agonist potency of RU486 is sufficient to induce nuclear translocation. This latter property can be viewed as being strictly dependent of hGRalpha protein conformation with bound RU486 which still enables steroid receptor coactivator 2 SRC 2 nuclear receptor coactivator 2 NCoA 2 glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 2 GRIP2 transcriptional intermediary factor 2 TIF 2 or SRC 1 binding as necessary condition for nuclear targeting. These conformational inductions of RU486 on hGRalpha protein structure are pictured next page top and bottom .

From these considerations of the three dimensional hGRalpha protein structure it can be deduced that the dimer postulated before is indeed not able to bind to hGRalpha because its size is too large to fit in the hGRalpha ligand binding domain LBD pocket. It certainly would not induce nuclear translocation.

The Flavivirus family Flaviviridae are single stranded RNA virus. Other pathogens of note in the Flavaviridae include Hepatitis C Yellow Fever West Nile St. Louis Encephalitis Japanese Encephalitis and Dengue Fever. They are vector transmitted mosquito or tick and generally causes mild flu like infections lasting less than a week. The Flavivirus have a unique set of secondary structures in their 3 untranslated regions UTRs which play roles in their replication as well as in their ability to produce subgenomic flavivirus sfRNAs when digested by host exonucleases. sfRNAs are of particular interest as they are believed to play roles in altering host metabolic pathways through alteration of host mRNA stability RNAi and DICER activity Roby 2014 . sfRNAs have been implicated in altering the immune response to promote viral pathogenicity Chang et al. 2013 as well as a recently discovered potential link between Zika microencephaly and Guillain Barr Syndrome Ricketson Lyons Weiller 2016 .

Zika originated in central western African and spread through parts of African Asia and Micronesia through the early part of the 21century. Introduction into the Americas raised concern when the virus began to spread rapidly in Brazil 2015 . The large number of cases have co occurring have demonstrated the additional dangers of Zika causing microcephaly and other birth defects in the fetuses of pregnant women Johannson et al. 2016 Malkki 2016 and in the increased incidence of Guillain Barre Syndrome Cao Lormeau et al. 2016 Paploski 2016 .

Microcephaly results from both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors are estimated to occur in 1 30 50 000 live births while environmental factors are more common estimated to occur in 1 10 000 live births. The connection between ZIka and microencephaly was made in Brazil in 2015 Moron et al. 2016 Saiz et al. 2016 Slavov et al. 2016 and although the data is preliminary and difficult to correlate it appears that case of microcephaly rose in infected areas of Brazil as much as 4 5 times in the northeast states of that country in 2015 Butler 2016 . The primary risk appears to coincide with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy Cauchenez et al. 2016 modeled data from cases in French Polynesia and estimated an increased risk for microcephaly 47.5 times greater in the first trimester if Zika infection occurred.

The CDC reported 3 988 076 births in the United States in 2014 CDC Vital Statistics Reports 2015 . Births per month remain fairly steady in the United States with the highest months being July and August each year Live Science 2010 . Extrapolating from 2006 data 56.64 of children in 2016 will be conceived between the months of March through September with Zika infected mosquitoes spreading throughout the country. That would place a 2 258 846 births in the upcoming year at increased risk for microcephaly. Using a 1 10 000 ratio as a guide that would mean a possible increase of microcephaly in the Unites States in the upcoming year of as much as 9.3 .

Guillain Barre syndrome GBS is an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The causes of GBS are elusive but have been demonstrated to occur following bacterial of viral infections. It has been theorized that inappropriate stimulation of the immune system by some infections is key to the induction of GBS. GBS is treated by plasma exchange or immunoglobulin therapy to lessen its duration and severity. Glucocorticoid therapy useful in other autoimmune conditions has been demonstrated to increase the severity of GBS.

To date only one research study Cao Lormeau et al. 2016 has demonstrated Zika Virus as the causative agent of GBS. Yung Thoon 2016 have modeled the increased risk of GBS following Zika infection using data gathered from French Polynesia in 2015. They report in increased incidence of GBS from a baseline of 0.24 per 1000 to 0.41 per 1000. This equates to a 21 fold risk increase of GBS.

Using 2004 data from the CDC Frenzen 2008 calculated the annual health care cost for GBS in the United States at 1.7B dollars annually. CDC 2015 data lists the frequency of GBS in the United States at approximately 1 100 000. The mortality of GBS has been estimated in several studies Alshekhlee et al. 2008 at 2.58 and at 3.9 van den Berg 2013 but can vary widely because of demographics such as age and access to health care. Extrapolation from these statistics presents a very chilling scenario where a fast spreading population of Zika infection can cause a cascade of reactions impacting the number of GBS cases health care costs and mortality rates.

The adverse reaction of patients receiving glucocorticoids with GBS is of particular interest with the compounds of the invention as they demonstrate not only in vitro antiviral activity but also glucocorticoid antagonism. This means the compound PT150 which has already been established as safe in Phase II Human Clinical Trials and the compound PT155 are potentially able to treat not only the infection but decrease the risks of contracting GBS and or mitigating its severity as a post infection occurrence.

PT150 formerly known as ORG34517 has activity versus Flaviviridae including Zika virus and yellow fever virus and possibly some Picornaviridae like poliovirus. The proposed mechanism of action is as follows PT150 represents a known and clinically validated potent and selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Most Flaviviridae excluding the genus Flavivirus and all Picornaviridae contain an internal ribosome entry site IRES at the 5 end of their ssRNA genome a 5 noncoding region 5 NCR . This IRES is in turn necessary for translation at human host cell ribosomes of the viral ssRNA genome into a polyprotein which is cleaved by host cellular and virally encoded proteases to yield mature viral proteins However there is also a highly conserved noncoding region NCR at the 3 end of the ssRNA genome the 3 NCR which exhibits a highly conserved stem loop containing RNA secondary structure refs 22 23 see graphic next side 

The 3 NCR binds several host cell proteins one being hVIP Mov34 which is required for proper Flavivirus propagation transcription replication . hVIP Mov34 human Vpr interacting protein is a member of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3A eIF3 family ref. 26 and is required for Flaviviridae 3 NCR controlled replication the exact roles of the 3 NCR in Flaviviridae replication are presently unknown and remain to be elucidated . This was specifically proved for the 3 NCR of Japanese encephalitis virus JEV a typical Flavivirus like Zika virus.

A Mov34 homologous protein serves as a 26S proteasome S12 subunit p40 the proteasome is the waste container of the human cell and degrades all overused misfolded and trash proteins by protease digestion within an enormously large protein complex called the 26S proteasome 

Mov34 like proteins are an integral part of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 eIF3 complex eIF3 subunit F p47 37.5 kDa eIF3 subunit H p40 39.9 kDa . Therefore Mov34 like proteins seem to be life essential and multi functional HIV 1 vpr accessory gene product protein Vpr interacts with the human Mov34 protein therefore Mov34 was termed human Vpr interacting protein hVIP Mov34 . Mov34 was linked to the G2 M phase transition of the mammalian cell cycle that means that hVIP Mov34 protein is essential for the transition from G2 to M phase of human cell division. The carboxyl terminus of hVIP Mov34 is critical for HIV 1 Vpr interaction and glucocorticoid mediated signaling. This defines the crucial interaction between human Mov34 protein and human glucocorticoid receptor alpha.

In the absence of Vpr or HIV 1 infection full length hVIP Mov34 is expressed in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization pattern of full length hVIP Mov34 protein however is shifted to a clear nuclear localization pattern in cells expressing both hVIP Mov34 and HIV 1 Vpr. In contrast Vpr did not alter the localization pattern of hVIP Mov34 mutants which have their carboxyl terminal domain deleted. The movement of hVIP Mov34 supported prior work that suggested that Vpr triggers activation of the glucocorticoid receptor complex. It was observed that dexamethasone moves hVIP Mov34 into the nucleus and that mifepristone RU38486 inhibited this effect. Interestingly the expression of an hVIP Mov34 carboxyl terminal mutant which is not responsive to Vpr is also not responsive to dexamethasone. These data illustrate that the carboxyl terminal domain of hVIP Mov34 is critical for mediating hVIP Mov34 Vpr interaction as well as for its hGRa response. These results support the view that hVIP Mov34 is a member of the complex array of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that are regulated by HIV 1 infection and hGRalpha.

Mov34 protein from mouse brain interacts with the 3 noncoding region 3 NCR of Japanese encephalitis virus. Therefore as Mov34 is a hGRa binding partner the 3 NCR of flaviviruses is human glucocorticoid receptor regulated and therefore prone to inhibition by glucocorticoid antagonists. Flaviviruses need Mov34 to replicate optimally in human cells. The glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone RU38486 was shown to inhibit Mov34 function in the case of HIV 1 infection. PT150 and presumably also PT155 bind as antagonists to human glucocorticoid receptor isoform alpha hGRalpha . Human glucocorticoid receptor isoform b hGRb is an inactive receptor. PT150 and or PT155 liganded hGRa also Hsp90 bound inactive complex in turn sequesters human Mov34 protein. This leads to a block of Flavivirus replication since Mov34 is made unavailable for binding to yellow fever and Zika virus 3 noncoding region 3 NCR . PT150 and PT155 act via hVIP Mov34 protein on Flavivirus 3 noncoding region which is also the origin of subgenomic flavivirus RNA sfRNA important for pathogenicity and immune evasion. hVIP Mov34 protein is human glucocorticoid receptor a regulated and binds both to hGRa and HIV 1 Vpr protein. hVIP Mov34 protein is indispensable for optimal replication and host pathogenicity of flaviviruses this effect requires binding of hVIP Mov34 to 3 NCR and to the 3 NCR derived sfRNA

hVIP Mov34 protein binds to Flavivirus 3 NCR and sfRNA the exact binding mode and further details are still unknown

PT155 is more potent than PT150 regarding inhibition of Flavivirus replication as is PT155 versus HIV 1 replication.

The compounds retinazone RTZ and PT155 share structural elements lipophilic core thiosemicarbazone head required for the inhibition of EBOV matrix protein VP40 octamerization and ring mediated RNA binding

We show here now that PT155 also acts as an in vitro inhibitor of EBOV replication and analogously to RTZ probably acts by inhibition of EBOV matrix protein VP40 octamerization and RNA binding in Vero cells first antifiloviral mechanism of action 

In addition PT150 and PT155 also antagonize Hsp90 in cells expressing hGRa second antifiloviral mechanism of action .

The compound PT155 is highly active versus the very first isolate of Zika virus MR766 obtained from rhesus monkey 766 at Zika Forest Uganda in 1947. This activity is seen in HuH 7 human hepatocellular carcinoma HCC hepatoma cells established from a liver tumor in a 57 year old Japanese male in 1982 by Nakabayashi Sato . In cells not expressing functional human glucocorticoid receptor alpha hGRalpha PT155 is generally not active versus Zika virus MR766. This strongly points to involvement of hGRalpha in the antiviral activity of PT155 versus Zika virus MR766.

Most Flaviviridae excluding the genus Flavivirus and all Picornaviridae contain an internal ribosome entry site IRES at the 5 end of their ssRNA genome a 5 noncoding region 5 NCR . This IRES is in turn necessary for translation at human host cell ribosomes of the viral ssRNA genome into a polyprotein which is cleaved by host cellular and virally encoded proteases to yield mature viral proteins . However there is also a highly conserved noncoding region NCR at the 3 end of the ssRNA genome the 3 NCR which exhibits a highly conserved stem loop containing RNA secondary structure.

The 3 NCR binds several host cell proteins one being hVIP Mov34 which is required for proper Flavivirus propagation transcription replication . hVIP Mov34 human Vpr interacting protein is a member of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3A eIF3 family and is required for Flaviviridae 3 NCR controlled replication the exact roles of the 3 NCR in Flaviviridae replication are presently unknown and remain to be elucidated . This was specifically proved for the 3 NCR of Japanese encephalitis virus JEV a typical Flavivirus like Zika virus.

Glucocorticoid receptor GR agonists dexamethasone and glucocorticoid antagonists mifepristone RU38486 interact with hVIP Mov34. Specifically GR agonists stimulate hVIP Mov34 translocation into the nucleus and mifepristone inhibits this translocation. Therefore mifepristone can act as an hVIP Mov34 antagonist and this antagonism is able to suppress Flaviviridae replication as was disclosed in an U.S. patent application for the Hepacivirus human hepatitis C virus by yet unknown detailed mechanism s .

Vero cell derivatives Vero Vero 76 Vero E6 do not contain human glucocorticoid receptor as they are derived from African green monkey epithelial kidney cells. They even do not contain a glucocorticoid receptor and Vero cells do not respond to dexamethasone. Therefore in all Vero cell derivatives Vero Vero 76 Vero E6 an antiviral effect of PT155 versus Flaviviridae will be obscured. hVIP Mov34 protein may be crucial to Flavivirus replication infectivity and pathogenicity and key to the antiflaviviral activity of PT compounds. Mov34 protein is named correctly Moloney murine leukemia provirus insertion disrupted protein of 36 kDa 

In the absence of Vpr or HIV 1 infection full length hVIP Mov34 is expressed in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization pattern of full length hVIP Mov34 protein however is shifted to a clear nuclear localization pattern in cells expressing both hVIP Mov34 and HIV 1 Vpr. In contrast Vpr did not alter the localization pattern of hVIP Mov34 mutants which have their carboxyl terminal domain deleted. The movement of hVIP Mov34 supported prior work that suggested that Vpr triggers activation of the glucocorticoid receptor complex. It was observed that dexamethasone moves hVIP Mov34 into the nucleus and that mifepristone RU38486 inhibited this effect. Interestingly the expression of an hVIP Mov34 carboxyl terminal mutant which is not responsive to Vpr is also not responsive to dexamethasone. These data illustrate that the carboxyl terminal domain of hVIP Mov34 is critical for mediating hVIP Mov34 Vpr interaction as well as for its hGRalpha response. These results support the view that hVIP Mov34 is a member of the complex array of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that are regulated by HIV 1 infection and hGRalpha. Mov34 protein from mouse brain interacts with the 3 noncoding region 3 NCR of Japanese encephalitis virus. Therefore as Mov34 is a hGRalpha binding partner the 3 NCR of flaviviruses is human glucocorticoid receptor regulated and therefore prone to inhibition by glucocorticoid antagonists. Flaviviruses need Mov34 to replicate optimally in human cells. The glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone RU38486 was shown to inhibit Mov34 function in the case of HIV 1 infection. PT155 binds as antagonist to human glucocorticoid receptor isoform alpha hGRalpha human glucocorticoid receptor isoform alpha hGRalpha is an inactive receptor being ligand independent . PT155 liganded hGRalpha also Hsp90 bound inactive complex in turn sequesters human Mov34 protein. This leads to a block of Flavivirus replication since Mov34 is made unavailable for binding to yellow fever and Zika virus 3 noncoding region 3 NCR .

hVIP Mov34 protein interacts with the 3 noncoding region 3 NCR derived subgenomic flavivirus RNA sfRNA which is generated by human host cell XRN1 exoribonuclease 5 3 exoRNase 

Summary of the Mechanism of Action of PT155 Versus the Flavivirus Congeners Yellow Fever Virus and Zika Virus 

As HIV 1 Vpr protein acts as a coactivator for hGRalpha and is dependent on hVIP Mov34 to exert this coactivator function it is highly probable that hVIP Mov34 analogously needs a cofactor for binding to Zika virus 3 NCR in conjunction with hGRalpha. Since it was found that PT compounds including PT155 are inactive versus dengue virus type 2 strain New Guinea C NGC replication in hGRalpha expressing HuH 7 cells a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST BLASTP 2.3.1 search was conducted for the viral protein product of maximal sequence difference between Zika virus MR766 and dengue virus type 2 NGC. This was anticipated to yield the hVIP Mov34 cofactor required for hGRalpha recruitment to Zika virus 3 NCR since this putative Zika virus cofactor was expected to be dysfunctional in dengue virus type 2. In turn this would explain the inactivity of PT compounds including PT155 versus dengue virus type 2.

It was found that the flaviviral non structural protein 2A NS2A exhibited least similarity or evolutionary conservation between Zika virus and dengue virus type 2. The absolute amino acid identity was only 29 whereas overall polyprotein absolute amino acid identity was 56 . This clearly pointed to involvement of Zika virus NS2A protein in antiviral action of PT155. The inactivity of PT compounds versus dengue virus type 2 is caused by missing affinity of PT compounds to the divergent dengue virus type 2 NS2A protein.

This coincidence was proved by a report that found strong physical binding of flaviviral NS2A protein to the corresponding Flavivirus 3 NCR. In a comprehensive recent tabulation of all viral and host cellular factors known to bind to Flavivirus 3 NCR both hVIP Mov34 and NS2A are indicated as high affinity ligands for flaviviral 3 NCR

The Mechanism of Action of PT155 and PT156 Versus Human Hepatitis C Virus Flaviviridae Hepacivirus HuH 7 Clone B Genotype 1a Replicon

PT155 and PT156 are active within human hepatitis C virus HCV genotype 1a HCV 1a HuH 7 cell derived subgenomic replicon established by C. M. Rice colleagues in 2000. The sequence of this replicon is based on the HCV 1a isolate H77 genome. PT156 is more active than PT155 and PT150 shows only marginal activity versus HCV 1a isolate H77 HuH 7 cell derived subgenomic replicon RNA replication.

The antihepaciviral action of PT155 and PT156 is mediated by the thiosemicarbazone motif or the 4 phenylthiosemicarbazone motif respectively 

Regarding the antiviral mechanism of action of PT155 and PT156 versus HCV 1a isolate H77 HuH 7 cell derived subgenomic replicon RNA replication it is inherently clear that it cannot being mediated by glucocorticoid receptors since HCV incorporates no DNA stage in its life cycle. It was recently reported that thiosemicarbazones DMI TSC target bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 BVDV 1 strain NADL Flaviviridae Pestivirus NS5B RdRp protein. BVDV 1 is commonly regarded as a suitable surrogate for HCV because both Flaviviridae polyprotein sequences are closely related maximal sequence identity 32 see Appendix 1 . Since the anti HCV 1a activity of PT155 and PT156 was determined with the HCV 1a isolate H77 HuH 7 cell derived subgenomic replicon which only codes for the non structural HCV proteins NS3 NS4A NS4B NS5A and NS5B the inhibiting action of PT155 and PT156 must be confined to these five genes and or gene products proteins .

HCV is one of the major causative agents for chronic hepatitis cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. As reported by the WHO HCV infects about 2.2 of the world s population with over a million new cases occurring each year. Furthermore 27 of these infected individuals eventually progress to liver cirrhosis among whom 25 finally develop hepatocellular carcinomas. HCV is a positive sense RNA virus that exhibits extensive genetic heterogeneity and a high level of resistance to antiviral drugs in vivo and in vitro. As such HCV genetic variation poses a huge problem for global public health.

As an essence PT156 successfully targets human hepatitis C virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase NS5B protein a hard target involving viral RNA replication hard targets represent indispensable and non compensable intracellular aspects of the viral life cycle soft targets represent dispensable and compensable extracellular aspects of the viral life cycle for example attachment entry fusion inhibitors or neuraminidase inhibitors . This qualifies PT156 as efficacious antihepaciviral compound worth further investigation.

PS serine cephalin represents an important inner membrane lipid in all human cells. PS represents a phospholipid together with phosphatidylcholine lecithin and phosphatidylethanolamine colamine cephalin . PS is constructed of 1 2 diacylglycerol 3 phospho L serine. The 1 2 diacylglycerol 3 phosphate is also called phosphatidic acid therefore the term phosphatidyl . PS is normally exposed on human cells only in the case of apoptosis programmed cell death voluntary cell suicide . Enveloped viruses expose PS on their host captured lipid bilayer membranes constantly. Enveloped viruses utilize this PS exposure to

Fatty acid composition at position 1 O and 2 O is subject of variation depending e.g. on cell type. The polar head group phosphoserine is negatively charged. The phosphate anion charge and the cation charge of the ammonium group neutralize each other. Therefore PS is net negatively charged at physiological pH 7.4.

The structure of a typical PC as shown with stearic acid at position 1 O and linoleic acid at position 2 O. This represents a major lecithin from egg yolk and human cell membranes. Fatty acid composition at position 1 O and 2 O is subject of variation depending e.g. on cell type. The polar head group phosphocholine is zwitterionic. The phosphate anion charge and the cation charge of the ammonium group neutralize each other. Therefore PC is net neutral at physiological pH 7.4.

Both ORG34517 and PT155 bind to PS but not to PC. Weak stereospecific binding to PC is only observed for the PT155 component E ORG34517 thiosemicarbazone which is contained in the three component mixture PT155. Therefore the PS binding of ORG34517 and PT155 is selective. ORG34517 and PT155 binding to PS is observed both in PS micelles and non micellar PS. The three components of PT155 the two E Z ORG34517 thiosemicarbazones and the residual original ORG34517 are readily resolved in the thin layer chromatographic run.

Norovirus infect humans and many other mammals causing severe gastroenteritis. Norovirus causes approximately 90 of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world Lindesmith et al. 2003 . Norovirus have also been isolated from numerous other species including pigs cattle sheep and mice. The zoonotic potential of norovirus is largely unstudied and may represent a reservoir from which new strains may emerge Thorne Goodfellow 2014 . Vaccines are not currently available and treatments which lessen the length of illness severity of symptoms period of infectiousness and loss of productivity and life are highly desirable.

The norovirus protein VP1 is unstable during capsid assembly and requires the host protein Hsp90 to assemble mature viral particles. Vaschist et al. 2012 have demonstrated that geldanamycin binds to Hsp90 and inhibits norovirus assembly and budding. Hsp90 complexes with GR in the host cytosol and is therefore susceptible to the action of hGR antagonists such as PT15x compounds according to the predicted stoichiometry 

The compounds of the invention have demonstrated activity against both human and murine norovirus suggesting broader applications among other norovirus in veterinary medicine research applications involving mice and human medical applications.

PT150 is highly active versus human Norwalk virus HuH 7 derived HG23 cell self replicating RNA replicon replication Norwalk virus human norovirus genotype 1 GT1 1968 original isolate Hu NV Norwalk virus 1968 US GenBank M87661.2 .

Heat shock protein 90 Hsp90 was suggested as therapeutic target for noroviruses in 2015 by Vashist et al. The mechanism is clearly glucocorticoid receptor dependent since PT150 as high affinity human glucocorticoid receptor alpha hGRalpha ligand is highly active against norovirus replicon RNA replication whereas PT155 is marginally active and PT156 is inactive. PT150 can reduce availability of Hsp90 by trapping it in an transcriptionally inactive dimeric complex 

The norovirus capsid protein VP1 is a very unstable protein and must be protected by the molecular chaperone Hsp90 to survive in the host cell cytosol. If Hsp90 is captured by PT150 in an inactive complex with hGRalpha then norovirus VP1 is degraded quickly by unknown mechanisms. Vashist et al. used geldanamycin derivatives to prove this. Geldanamycin binds to Hsp90 also 17 allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin and water soluble derivatives of geldanamycin used in this study like 17 N 2 dimethylamino ethyl amino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin which inhibited norovirus assembly and budding.

Taken together PT150 reduces availability of Hsp90 for noroviruses by trapping Hsp90 into an inactive complex hGRalpha PT150 Hsp90 n m n 1 2 . . . m 2 . This prevents stabilization of the sensitive viral capsid protein VP1 and leads to degradation of this viral capsid component by yet unknown mechanisms. In consequence norovirus assembly and budding are abrogated by the hGRalpha high affinity ligand PT150.

Implications for antiviral chemotherapy of Norovirus infections The prototype norovirus Norwalk virus was first described in 1972 as the etiological agent responsible for an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in an elementary school in Norwalk Ohio USA. Noroviruses are now accepted as a leading cause of gastroenteritis in developed and developing countries. Spread primarily via the faecal oral route norovirus infections are typically an acute self limiting gastrointestinal infection. Norovirus gastroenteritis has recently been identified as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised and can result in long term persistent disease. Norovirus infection has also been associated with a number of more significant clinical outcomes necrotizing enterocolitis seizures in infants encephalopathy pneumatosis intestinalis and disseminated intravascular coagulation to name but a few. In developing countries an estimated 200 000 deaths in children 

Noroviruses are members of the family Caliciviridae of small positive sense RNA viruses which is divided currently into five genera Vesivirus Lagovirus Nebovirus Sapovirus and Norovirus. Members of the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus are able to infect humans and cause gastroenteritis. The genus Norovirus is subdivided into at least five genotypes GT1 5 . Genotypes GT1 GT2 and GT4 infect humans and cause acute gastroenteritis but noroviruses have also been isolated from numerous other species including pigs GT2 cattle and sheep GT3 and mice GT5 . More recently a novel norovirus identified in domestic dogs with diarrhoea has been proposed to represent a new genotype GT6. To date zoonotic norovirus infections have not been reported but there is clear evidence of the potential for transmission. For example human noroviruses can infect gnotobiotic piglets and there is serological evidence of human noroviruses in pigs. Whilst antibodies to GT6 noroviruses have been identified in veterinarians it has yet to be determined whether infection results in clinical disease. Additional studies are required to further elucidate the zoonotic potential of noroviruses and whether animals represent a reservoir from which new strains may emerge.

The invention provides Therapeutic Compositions and Methods to Mitigate Addiction. The present invention enables PT150 formerly ORG34517 or its derivatives e.g. PT 155 PT 156 PT 157 a highly potent and selective corticosteroid antagonist to prevent the signs and symptoms of physical withdrawal when administered to someone with physical addiction at or near the time of withdrawal of the addictive compound. The mechanism underlying this effect is that the central nervous system CNS pathways governing physical withdrawal are dependent on cortisol or other glucocorticoid binding. When blockade is established by administration of PT150 or its derivatives e.g. PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof the pathways fail to function and physical withdrawal symptoms are not produced.

The broad field of addiction research has established that corticosteroids appear to play important roles in other aspects of addiction behaviors and mechanisms. They have a key role in promoting a shift from recreational or medicinal in the case of opiates to compulsive use meaning use that is driven by physical addiction. The terminology of this shift is tricky but simply put goal tracking in animal models indicates that animals pay more attentional and display behavior directly linked to obtaining a rewarding substance. For example in a rat that is pressing a bar to receive food pellets with opiates in them the rat initially will focus on the food delivery door and scratch the door etc. However when physical addiction occurs with repeated exposure to the opiates animals shift their focus and behavior to the stimuli that predict drug delivery namely the bar pressing. This is called sign tracking .

An analogous human condition would be an alcohol dependent individual for example that initially experiences thoughts and subjective feelings of reward when drinking alcohol. With continued use of high doses of alcohol physical addiction develops. At that point alcohol cues which may include for example drinking buddies bar signs emotional stress or tension the time of day or day of the week when drinking usually takes place provide reward to the addict in a manner similar to the actual drug of abuse. This is a key signal that physical addiction has occurred. Abundant animal work and other studies exploring the translation of these findings to human subjects suggest that increases in circulating corticosteroids at the least are highly correlated with sign tracking.

According to the Alzheimer s Association Dementia is not a specific disease. It s an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person s ability to perform everyday activities. Alzheimer s disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases. Vascular dementia which occurs after a stroke is the second most common dementia type.

Glucocorticoid receptor activity stimulated by administration of the steroid hormone corticosterone perturbs neuronal function in the rodent hippocampus a brain region which is critical to learning and the formation of memories in all mammals and which is known to be atrophied in those with Alzheimer s Disease or Major Depressive Disorder. Work conducted has demonstrated that such effects are dependent on over activation of glucocorticoid receptors GRs result of hypercortisolemia and subsequent enhancement of glutamate receptor activity via effects at the level of transcription and or trafficking of receptor subunits. Indeed one medication federally approved for the treatment of Alzheimer s Disease Namenda memantine is a short acting glutamate receptor inhibitor reviewed in Zhou et al. 2016 supporting evidence of a role for these receptors in the initiation of brain atrophy.

The evidence discussed above also suggests that modulation of GRs may represent a therapeutic target in the treatment of dementing illnesses as hypothesized by Dhikav and Anand 2007 though clinical research has not yet confirmed this possibility and this has not been tested with use of a selective GR antagonist or active agent such as ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In a mouse model of Alzheimer s Disease subchronic treatment with the non selective GR progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone prevented losses in episodic memory. However the lack pharmacological specificity observed with mifepristone use does not allow for a clear examination of GR signaling in this context.

Studies examined effects of selective and competitive inhibition of GRs with use of PT150 or PT155 on corticosteroid induced hippocampal neuronal loss using a validated organotypic slice culture model. Slice cultures of rat hippocampus are surgically harvested and maintained in vitro for 5 days prior to experimentation. After 5 days slice cultures are transferred to treatment wells containing corticosterone 0.1 1 M or corticosterone vehicle peanut oil for a 5 day continuous treatment. Portions of these cultures both corticosterone exposed and na ve cultures are also co exposed to PT150 or PT155 1 100 nM in cell culture medium for the duration of the 5 days. After 5 days cultures were either harvested to measure cytotoxicity propidium iodide uptake and immunoreactivity of neuron specific nuclear protein and glutamate receptor density or exposed to the glutamate receptor agonist NMDA for a period of 24 hr. In the latter cultures measures of cytotoxicity and receptor density was assessed after NMDA exposure. It is revealed that 5 day corticosterone exposure at concentrations greater than 1 nM induced cytoxicity in the cornu ammonis 1 pyramidal cell layer and the co exposure to PT150 and PT155 attenuate this cytotoxicity. This cell layer is a region that is critical for the formation of memory in mammals and is known to degenerate in dementias. It is determined that PT150 and PT155 produce effects of cellular integrity in corticosterone na ve cultures. Additionally corticosterone exposure upregulates NR2B subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors and markedly enhance the neurotoxicity of NMDA itself demonstrating a steroid hormone receptor mediated elevation of glutamate signaling in a brain region that is critical to memory formation.

Amyloid beta A or Abeta denotes peptides of 36 43 amino acids that are crucially involved in Alzheimer s disease as the main component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer patients. The peptides result from the amyloid precursor protein APP which is cleaved by and secretase to yield A . AP is formed after sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein APP a transmembrane glycoprotein of undetermined function. APP can be cleaved by the proteolytic enzymes and secretase A protein is generated by successive action of the and secretases. A molecules can aggregate to form flexible soluble oligomers which may exist in several forms. Certain misfolded oligomers known as seeds can induce other A molecules to also take the misfolded oligomeric form leading to a chain reaction akin to a prion infection. The seeds or the resulting amyloid plaques are toxic to nerve cells. The other protein implicated in Alzheimer s disease tau protein also forms such prion like misfolded oligomers and there is some evidence that misfolded A can induce tau to misfold.

The triboelectric PT155 could form nanomagnets in the brain of Morbus Alzheimer patients leading to disruption of A amyloid fibrillar aggregates restoring brain functions to more or lesser extent. Since Alzheimer fibrills are itself highly structured aggregates with polarized order inducing an electromagnetic field in the brain. By inserting a nanomagnetic material into the A supramolecular ordered sheets could disrupt the polarized order orientation polarization of permanent dipoles of Alzheimer A fibrills making them subject to degradation in the proteasome.

A nanomagnet is a submicrometric system that presents spontaneous magnetic order magnetization at zero applied magnetic field remanence . The small size of nanomagnets prevents the formation of magnetic domains. The magnetization dynamics of sufficiently small nanomagnets at low temperatures typically single molecule magnets presents quantum phenomena such as macroscopic spin tunnelling. At larger temperatures the magnetization undergoes random thermal fluctuations superparamagnetism which present a limit for the use of nanomagnets for permanent information storage.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction verbal and non verbal communication and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life. These signs often develop gradually though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood typically before age three. While autism is highly heritable researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes. In rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum disorders ASDs the other two being Asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as PDD NOS which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.

The triboelectric PT155 can form nanomagnets in the brain of autism patients leading to unknown effects of nerve cells neurons . It is believed that in autism spectrum disorders cortisol levels are elevated

The present invention relates to methods of and compositions for treating and relieving symptoms associated with substance abuse and withdrawal. The present invention relates to methods of and compositions for treating addiction to for example alcohol drugs caffeine sugar food nicotine opiates and or marijuana etc.

Substance addiction and abuse is a multi factorial neurological disease. Over time repeated exposure to various substances both endogenous and exogenous causes modification of the neurotransmission circuits and adaptations in post receptor signaling cascades. There are several effects of this neuronal modification. Among them there is a reduction in the ability of natural rewards to activate the reward pathways leading to depressed motivation and mood and an increased compulsion to compensate for the physiological change.

While the common perception underlying addiction is that of a reward circuit pleasure may not necessarily be a strong enough impetus to drive people towards their addictions. Rather addictive behavior arises from an intense desire to manage and or avoid the anxiety that arises when someone is experiencing withdrawal.

Traditional treatments for substance dependency such as benzodiazepine abuse have been based upon cognitive behavioral therapy or drug therapy or a combination thereof. Conventional methods of treatment fail however in that they do not address the physiochemical changes that occur with addiction and dependence. Thus conventional treatments for controlling withdrawal symptoms and cravings for addictive substances have had limited success and often have undesirable side effects.

What is therefore needed are improved methods of and compositions for preventing addiction to and physiological dependence upon addictive substances. What is also needed is an improved treatment methodology for controlling cravings and withdrawal symptoms caused by substance abuse.

Accordingly the invention provides methods of and compositions for preventing addiction to and physiological dependence upon addictive substances. Also provided are methods of and compositions for an improved treatment methodology for controlling cravings and withdrawal symptoms caused by substance abuse.

The present invention relates to the use of cortisol blockers glucocorticoid receptor GR antagonists for the prevention or addiction induced anxiety and withdrawal side effects as a therapeutic and in concert with a diagnostic.

The compounds of the invention may be administered enterally or parenterally. Mixed with pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries e.g. as described in the standard reference Gennaro et al. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences. The compounds may be compressed into solid dosage units such as pills tablets or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied in the form of a solution suspension emulsion e.g. for use as an injection preparation or eye drops or as a spray e.g. for use as a nasal spray.

For making dosage units e.g. tablets the use of conventional additives such as fillers colorants polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used.

For example the invention provides with at least one glucocorticoid receptor antagonist in combination with at least one androgen receptor antagonist such as for example ARN 509 4 7 6 Cyano 5 trifluoromethyl 3 pyridinyl 8 oxo 6 thioxo 5 7 diazaspiro 3.4 oct 5 yl 2 fluoro N methylbenzamide . ARN 509 is a novel androgen receptor AR antagonist for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer CRPC . ARN 509 inhibits AR nuclear translocation and AR binding to androgen response elements and unlike bicalutamide does not exhibit agonist properties in the context of AR overexpression.

Another exemplary antiadrogen is bicalutamide which has the chemical name R S N 4 cyano 3 4 fluorophenylsulfonyl 2 hydroxy 2 methyl 3 triflu oromethyl propanamide Flutamide brand name Eulexin nilutamide brand names Anandron and Nilandron and bicalutamide brand name Casodex are nonsteroidal pure antiandrogens 5 alpha reductase inhibitors such as finasteride brand names Proscar and Propecia dutasteride brand name Avodart bexlosteride izonsteride turosteride and epristeride are antiandrogenic as they prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone DHT Spironolactone brand names Aldactone and Spirotone a synthetic 17 spirolactone corticosteroid Cyproterone acetate brand names Androcur Climen Diane 35 and Ginette 35 is a synthetic steroid a potent antiandrogen that also possesses progestational properties. Hydroxyflutamide.

In some embodiments steroidal or nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonists include but are not limited to flutamide hydroxyflutamide enzalutamide bicalutamide nilutamide or hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor.

In one embodiment the androgen receptor antagonist is enzalutamide marketed as Xtandi Astellas Pharma US Inc. also known as and referred to herein as MDV3100 having the chemical name 4 3 4 cyano 3 trifluoromethyl phenyl 5 5 dimethyl 4 oxo 2 thioxoimidazolidin 1 yl 2 fluoro N methylbenzamide.

The compositions and methods of the invention may also make use of one or more androgen receptor antagonist such as in a combination with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist of the invention.

The selective androgen receptor AR antagonists embodied herein have utility for numerous conditions and diseases such as but not limited to male contraception treatment of a variety of male hormone related conditions such as hypersexuality and sexual deviation treatment of conditions including benign prostatic hyperplasia acne vugaris androgenetic alopecia and hirsutism purposefully preventing or counteracting masculinisation in the case of transsexual women undergoing sex reassignment therapy an antineoplastic agent and palliative adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in prostate cancer and decreasing the incidence of halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men around the world and is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men in the United States. The androgen receptor antagonist drugs such as flutamide and bicalutamide were originally designed to avoid the side effects of HT but androgen agonism was observed for hydroxyfluamide the active form of flutamide and bicalutamide. The compositions of the present invention are combinations of GCRAs and for example androgen receptor antagonists which can be used to alleviate any condition associated with inappropriate activation of the androgen receptor. In addition to prostate cancer other examples of such conditions include acne hirsutism seborrhoea excess sebum and alopecia. In order to exhibit the therapeutic properties described above the compounds need to be administered in a quantity sufficient to inhibit activation of the androgen receptor. In a typical embodiment the compounds are administered topically which is especially appropriate for hirsutism alopecia acne and hyperseborhhea. Androgens having a profound effect on hair loss stimulate hair growth by prolonging the growth phase of the hair cycle anagen and increasing follicle size. Hair growth on the scalp does not require androgens but paradoxically androgens are necessary for balding on the scalp in genetically predisposed individuals androgenic alopecia where there is a progressive decline in the duration of anagen and in hair follicle size. The compositions of the invention may also be used topically to decrease seborrhea production and more specifically to alleviate hyperseborrhoea oily skin which can be used topically alleviate acne.

The compositions and methods of the invention may also make use of one or more PARP inhibitors such as in a combination with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist of the invention. The poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP is also known as poly ADP ribose synthase and poly ADP ribosyltransferase. PARP catalyzes the formation of mono and poly ADP ribose polymers which can attach to cellular proteins as well as to itself and thereby modify the activities of those proteins. The enzyme plays a role in regulation of transcription cell proliferation and chromatin remodeling see D amours et al. Biochem. 342 249268 1999 .

Poly ADP ribose polymerase has an essential role in facilitating DNA repair controlling RNA transcription mediating cell death and regulating immune response. These actions make PARJP inhibitors targets for a broad spectrum of disorders. Virag L. et al. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002 54 3 375 429 . In various preclinical cancer models and human clinical trials PARP inhibitors have been shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing apoptosis of cancer cells limiting tumor growth decreasing metastasis and prolonging the survival of tumor bearing subjects. WO 2007 084532 Donawho C. K. et al. Clin Cancer Res 2007 13 9 2728 37 Kummar S. et al. J Clin Oncol. 2009 27 16 2705 11 .

PARP comprises an N terminal DNA binding domain an automodification domain and a C terminal catalytic domain. Various cellular proteins interact with PARP. The N terminal DNA binding domain contains two zinc finger motifs. Transcription enhancer factor 1 TEF 1 retinoid X receptor a DNA polymerase a X ray repair cross complementing factor 1 XRCC1 and PARP itself interact with PARP in this domain. The automodification domain contains a BRCT motif one of the protein protein interaction modules. This motif is originally found in the C terminus of BRCA1 breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 and is present in various proteins related to DNA repair recombination and cell cycle checkpoint control. POU homeodomain containing octamer transcription factor 1 Oct 1 YinYang YY 1 and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 ubc9 could interact with this BRCT motif in PARP.

More than 15 members of the PARP family of genes are present in the mammalian genome. PARP family proteins and poly ADP ribose glycohydrolase PARG which degrades poly ADP ribose to ADP ribose are involved in a variety of cell regulatory functions including DNA damage response and transcriptional regulation and associated with carcinogenesis and the biology of cancer.

Several PARP family proteins have been identified. Tankyrase has been found as an interacting protein of telomere regulatory factor 1 TRF 1 and is involved in telomere regulation. Vault PARP VPARP is a component in the vault complex which acts as a nuclear cytoplasmic transporter. PARP 2 PARP 3 and 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin inducible PARP TiPARP have also been identified. Therefore poly ADP ribose metabolism could be related to a variety of cell regulatory functions.

A member of this gene family is PARP 1. The PARP 1 gene product is expressed at high levels in the nuclei of cells and is dependent upon DNA damage for activation. It is believed that PARP 1 binds to DNA single or double stranded breaks DSBs through an amino terminal DNA binding domain. The binding activates the carboxy terminal catalytic domain and results in the formation of polymers of ADP ribose on target molecules. PARP 1 is itself a target of poly ADP ribosylation by virtue of a centrally located automodification domain. The ribosylation of PARP 1 causes dissociation of the PARP 1 molecules from the DNA. The entire process of binding ribosylation and dissociation occurs very rapidly. It has been suggested that this transient binding of PARP 1 to sites of DNA damage results in the recruitment of DNA repair machinery or may act to suppress the recombination long enough for the recruitment of repair machinery.

The source of ADP ribose for the PARP reaction is nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide NAD . NAD is synthesized in cells from cellular ATP stores and thus high levels of activation of PARP activity can rapidly lead to depletion of cellular energy stores. It has been demonstrated that induction of PARP activity can lead to cell death that is correlated with depletion of cellular NAD and ATP pools. PARP activity is induced in many instances of oxidative stress or during inflammation. For example during reperfusion of ischemic tissues reactive nitric oxide is generated and nitric oxide results in the generation of additional reactive oxygen species including hydrogen peroxide peroxynitrate and hydroxyl radical. These latter species can directly damage DNA and the resulting damage induces activation of PARP activity. Frequently it appears that sufficient activation of PARP activity occurs such that the cellular energy stores are depleted and the cell dies. A similar mechanism is believed to operate during inflammation when endothelial cells and pro inflammatory cells synthesize nitric oxide which results in oxidative DNA damage in surrounding cells and the subsequent activation of PARP activity. The cell death that results from PARP activation is believed to be a major contributing factor in the extent of tissue damage that results from ischemia reperfusion injury or from inflammation. PARP poly ADP ribose polymerase participates in a variety of DNA related functions including cell proliferation differentiation apoptosis DNA repair and also effects on telomere length and chromosome stability d Adda di Fagagna et al. Nature Gen. 23 1 76 80 1999 . Oxidative stress induced overactivation of PARP consumes NAD and consequently ATP culminating in cell dysfunction or necrosis. This cellular suicide mechanism has been implicated in the pathomechanism of cancer stroke myocardial ischemia diabetes diabetes associated cardiovascular dysfunction shock traumatic central nervous system injury arthritis colitis allergic encephalomyelitis and various other forms of inflammation. PARP has also been shown to associate with and regulate the function of several transcription factors.

The invention provides a method for treating and or preventing treatment resistant prostate cancer in a patient in need of such treatment and or prevention comprising administering to the patient therapeutically effective amounts of a GCR glucocorticoid receptor antagonist as exemplified herein in combination with for example a neoplasia treating agent including for example an androgen receptor AR antagonist. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the second leading cause of death from cancer in North American and European males. New therapeutic approaches are needed to prevent and treat advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. Nutritional factors particularly high intake of protein and calcium as well as metabolic syndrome are known to modify prostate cancer risk and progression but the molecular mechanisms linking nutrition to prostate cancer are unknown. There are also links between prostate cancer and bone metabolism. Osteocalcin OC which encodes a vitamin K dependent hormone predominantly produced by osteoblasts osteocytes in bone which functions to regulate energy metabolism is also ectopically expressed by some prostate cancers that have a propensity to metastasize to bone. Polymorphisms in OC are also associated with prostate cancer progression. Recent evidence has also identified a correlation between the bone transcription factor Runx2 and advanced stages of prostate and breast cancer as evidenced by the effects of depletion of Runx2 by RNA interference to inhibit migration and invasive properties of the cells and prevent metastatic bone disease. It is possible that OC secreted by bone may directly target prostate cancer cells. Finally androgen deprivation therapy is the principal medical therapy for prostate cancer but androgen ablation often becomes ineffective in controlling prostate cancer progression and castration resistant metastatic disease particularly to bone becomes incurable. There is growing evidence for the presence of a putative membrane androgen sensing receptor that mediates the rapid non genomic effects of androgens which also might be involved in prostate cancer growth and metastasis. Regardless clues to possible new molecular targets to regulate prostate cancer growth and progression may be discovered from a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nutritional risk factors OC effects and androgen resistance in prostate cancer.

New compositions and methods are provided which advantageously employ compounds having a newly defined immune modulating function or which have the ability to mimic that immune modulating function or a combination of such compounds. For the purposes of the present disclosure the terms immune mimic immune modulating immune modulator immune modulation immune control immune inhibition immune suppressor and the like refer in most instances to the newly identified cancer cell growth i.e. proliferation inhibitory effect of the secretory immune system i.e. dimeric polymeric IgA and pentameric IgM that is mediated by a newly identified Poly Ig receptor or Poly Ig like receptor also classified as an Fc like receptor and not to the usual antibody antigen recognition based immune function of the immune system. In this context the terms immune modulation or immune enhancement refer especially to the modulation or enhancement of these cell growth inhibitory immunoglobulins of the secretory immune system. The term immune mimic refers to a substance e.g. tamoxifen that can function in a similar manner to an immunoglobulin inhibitor of cell growth. In some instances however reference is also made herein to natural immune inhibition immune enhancer immune modulator immune system immune therapy and immune response and the like in which the conventional meanings of those terms are intended and the context so indicates especially when prior art methods compounds and compositions are described. Hereinafter an indication has been made in appropriate instances whether a conventional definition or the new meaning or both is intended. A synergistic action of the compounds of the invention e.g. ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or a derivative thereof as defined according to the present invention and of an auxiliary substance which may be optionally contained in the inventive pharmaceutical composition as described above is preferably achieved thereby. Depending on the various types of auxiliary substances various mechanisms can come into consideration in this respect. In general it is possible to use as auxiliary substance any agent that influences the immune system in the manner of a danger signal LPS GP96 etc. or cytokines such as GM CSF which allow for an immune response produced by the immune stimulating adjuvant according to the invention to be enhanced and or influenced in a targeted manner. Particularly preferred auxiliary substances are cytokines such as monokines lymphokines interleukins or chemokines that further promote the innate immune response such as IL 1 IL 1 receptor antagonist IL 2 EL 3 EL 4 IL 5 IL 6 EL 7 IL 8 EL 9 ELIO IL 12 EL 13 EL 14 EL 15 EL 16 IL 17 EL 18 IL 19 EL 20 EL 21 EL 22 DL 23 EL 24 IL 25 EL 26 EL 27 EL 28 EL 29 EL 30 EL 31 EL 32 EL 33 INF alpha EFN beta INF gamma GM CSF G CSF M CSF LT beta or TNF alpha growth factors such as hGH.

The inventive pharmaceutical composition can also additionally or alternatively contain any further compound which is known to be immune stimulating due to its binding affinity as ligands to human Toll like receptors TLR1 TLR2 TLR3 TLR4 TLR5 TLR6 TLR7 TLR8 TLR9 TLR10 or due to its binding affinity as ligands to murine Toll like receptors TLR1 TLR2 TLR3 TLR4 TLR5 TLR6 TLR7 TLR8 TLR9 TLR10 TLR11 TLR12 or TLR13.

Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of the inventive compound and or combination as a therapeutic agent for the prophylaxis and or treatment of Neurodegenerative Disease.

The present invention also relates generally to the fields of neurology and psychiatry and to methods of protecting the cells of a mammalian central nervous system from damage or injury. Injuries or trauma of various kinds to the central nervous system CNS or the peripheral nervous system PNS can produce profound and long lasting neurological and or psychiatric symptoms and disorders. One form that this can take is the progressive death of neurons or other cells of the central nervous system CNS i.e. neurodegeneration or neuronal degeneration. Neuronal degeneration as a result of for example Alzheimer s disease multiple sclerosis cerebral vascular accidents CVAs stroke traumatic brain injury spinal cord injuries degeneration of the optic nerve e.g. ischemic optic neuropathy or retinal degeneration and other central nervous system disorders is an enormous medical and public health problem by virtue of both its high incidence and the frequency of long term sequelae. Animal studies and clinical trials have shown that amino acid transmitters especially glutamate oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions contribute strongly to cell death in these conditions. Upon injury or upon ischemic insult damaged neurons release massive amounts of the neurotransmitter glutamate which is excitotoxic to the surrounding neurons. Glutamate is a negatively charged amino acid that is an excitatory synaptic transmitter in the mammalian nervous system. Although the concentration of glutamate can reach the millimolar range in nerve terminals its extracellular concentration is maintained at a low level to prevent neurotoxicity. It has been noted that glutamate can be toxic to neurons if presented at a high concentration. The term excitotoxicity has been used to describe the cytotoxic effect that glutamate and other such excitatory amino acids can have on neurons when applied at high dosages.

Patients with injury or damage of any kind to the central CNS or peripheral PNS nervous system including the retina may benefit from neuroprotective methods. This nervous system injury may take the form of an abrupt insult or an acute injury to the nervous system as in for example acute neurodegenerative disorders including but not limited to acute injury hypoxia ischemia or the combination thereof resulting in neuronal cell death or compromise. Acute injury includes but is not limited to traumatic brain injury TBI including closed blunt or penetrating brain trauma focal brain trauma diffuse brain damage spinal cord injury intracranial or intravertebral lesions including but not limited to contusion penetration shear compression or laceration lesions of the spinal cord or whiplash shaken infant syndrome .

The term neuroprotection as used herein shall mean inhibiting preventing ameliorating or reducing the severity of the dysfunction degeneration or death of nerve cells axons or their supporting cells in the central or peripheral nervous system of a mammal including a human. This includes the treatment or prophylaxis of a neurodegenerative disease protection against excitotoxicity or ameliorating the cytotoxic effect of a compound for example a excitatory amino acid such as glutamate a toxin or a prophylactic or therapeutic compound that exerts an immediate or delayed cytotoxic side effect including but not limited to the immediate or delayed induction of apoptosis in a patient in need thereof.

The term a patient in need of treatment with a neuroprotective drug as used herein will refer to any patient who currently has or may develop any of the above syndromes or disorders or any disorder in which the patient s present clinical condition or prognosis could benefit from providing neuroprotection to prevent the development extension worsening or increased resistance to treatment of any neurological or psychiatric disorder.

The term treating or treatment as used herein refers to any indicia of success in the prevention or amelioration of an injury pathology or condition including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement remission diminishing of symptoms or making the injury pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline making the final point of degeneration less debilitating or improving a subject s physical or mental well being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters including the results of a physical examination neurological examination and or psychiatric evaluations.

In some embodiments this invention provides methods of neuroprotection. In certain embodiments these methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of the composition and or combination of the invention to a patient who has not yet developed overt clinical signs or symptoms of injury or damage to the cells of the nervous system but who may be in a high risk group for the development of neuronal damage because of injury or trauma to the nervous system or because of some known predisposition either biochemical or genetic or the finding of a verified biomarker of one or more of these disorders.

Thus in some embodiments the methods and compositions of the present invention are directed toward neuroprotection in a subject who is at risk of developing neuronal damage but who has not yet developed clinical evidence. This patient may simply be at greater risk as determined by the recognition of any factor in a subject s or their families medical history physical exam or testing that is indicative of a greater than average risk for developing neuronal damage. Therefore this determination that a patient may be at a greater risk by any available means can be used to determine whether the patient should be treated with the methods of the present invention.

Accordingly in an exemplary embodiment subjects who may benefit from treatment by the methods and the composition and or combination of this invention can be identified using accepted screening methods to determine risk factors for neuronal damage. These screening methods include for example conventional work ups to determine risk factors including but not limited to for example head trauma either closed or penetrating CNS infections bacterial or viral cerebrovascular disease including but not limited to stroke brain tumors brain edema cysticercosis porphyria metabolic encephalopathy drug withdrawal including but not limited to sedative hypnotic or alcohol withdrawal abnormal perinatal history including anoxia at birth or birth injury of any kind cerebral palsy learning disabilities hyperactivity history of febrile convulsions as a child history of status epilepticus family history of epilepsy or any seizure related disorder inflammatory disease of the brain including lupis drug intoxication either direct or by placental transfer including but not limited to cocaine poisoning parental consanguinity and treatment with medications that are toxic to the nervous system including psychotropic medications.

The determination of which patients may benefit from treatment with a neuroprotective drug in patients who have no clinical signs or symptoms may be based on a variety of surrogate markers or biomarkers .

As used herein the terms surrogate marker and biomarker are used interchangeably and refer to any anatomical biochemical structural electrical genetic or chemical indicator or marker that can be reliably correlated with the present existence or future development of neuronal damage. In some instances brain imaging techniques such as computer tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI or positron emission tomography PET can be used to determine whether a subject is at risk for neuronal damage. Suitable biomarkers for the methods of this invention include but are not limited to the determination by MRI CT or other imaging techniques of sclerosis atrophy or volume loss in the hippocampus or overt mesial temporal sclerosis MTS or similar relevant anatomical pathology the detection in the patient s blood serum or tissues of a molecular species such as a protein or other biochemical biomarker e.g. elevated levels of ciliary neurotrophic factor CNTF or elevated serum levels of a neuronal degradation product or other evidence from surrogate markers or biomarkers that the patient is in need of treatment with a neuroprotective drug.

It is expected that many more such biomarkers utilizing a wide variety of detection techniques will be developed in the future. It is intended that any such marker or indicator of the existence or possible future development of neuronal damage as the latter term is used herein may be used in the methods of this invention for determining the need for treatment with the compounds and methods of this invention.

A determination that a subject has or may be at risk for developing neuronal damage would also include for example a medical evaluation that includes a thorough history a physical examination and a series of relevant bloods tests. It can also include an electroencephalogram EEG CT MRI or PET scan. A determination of an increased risk of developing neuronal damage or injury may also be made by means of genetic testing including gene expression profiling or proteomic techniques. For psychiatric disorders that may be stabilized or improved by a neuroprotective drug e.g. bipolar disorder schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia impulse control disorders etc. the above tests may also include a present state exam and a detailed history of the course of the patients symptoms such as mood disorder symptoms and psychotic symptoms over time and in relation to other treatments the patient may have received over time e.g. a life chart. These and other specialized and routine methods allow the clinician to select patients in need of therapy using the methods and formulations of this invention. In some embodiments of the present invention compounds and or compositions suitable for use in the practice of this invention will be administered either singly or concomitantly with at least one or more other compounds or therapeutic agents e.g. with other neuroprotective drugs or antiepileptic drugs anticonvulsant drugs. In these embodiments the present invention provides methods to treat or prevent neuronal injury in a patient. The method includes the step of administering to a patient in need of treatment an effective amount of the compounds and or compositions disclosed herein in combination with an effective amount of one or more other compounds or therapeutic agents that have the ability to provide neuroprotection or to treat or prevent seizures or epileptogenesis or the ability to augment the neuroprotective effects of the compounds of the invention.

As used herein the term combination administration of a compound therapeutic agent or known drug with the combination of the present invention means administration of the drug and the one or more compounds at such time that both the known drug and or combination will have a therapeutic effect. In some cases this therapeutic effect will be synergistic. Such concomitant administration can involve concurrent i.e. at the same time prior or subsequent administration of the drug with respect to the administration of the composition and or combination of the present invention. A person of ordinary skill in the art would have no difficulty determining the appropriate timing sequence and dosages of administration for particular drugs of the present invention.

The said one or more other compounds or therapeutic agents may be selected from compounds that have one or more of the following properties antioxidant activity NMDA receptor antagonist activity augmentation of endogenous GABA inhibition NO synthase inhibitor activity iron binding ability e.g. an iron chelator calcium binding ability e.g. a Ca II chelator zinc binding ability e.g. a Zn II chelator the ability to effectively block sodium or calcium ion channels or to open potassium or chloride ion channels in the CNS of a patient.

Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of the inventive compound and or combination such as for example ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as a therapeutic agent for the prophylaxis and or treatment of heart disease. Heart disease is a general term used to describe many different heart conditions. For example coronary artery disease which is the most common heart disease is characterized by constriction or narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart with oxygen rich blood and can lead to myocardial infarction which is the death of a portion of the heart muscle. Heart failure is a condition resulting from the inability of the heart to pump an adequate amount of blood through the body. Heart failure is not a sudden abrupt stop of heart activity but rather typically develops slowly over many years as the heart gradually loses its ability to pump blood efficiently. Risk factors for heart failure include coronary artery disease hypertension valvular heart disease cardiomyopathy disease of the heart muscle obesity diabetes and or a family history of heart failure.

Examples of cardiovascular diseases and disorders are aneurysm stable angina unstable angina angina pectoris angioneurotic edema aortic valve stenosis aortic aneurysm arrhythmia arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia arteriosclerosis arteriovenous malformations atrial fibrillation Behcet syndrome bradycardia cardiac tamponade cardiomegaly congestive card iomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy carotid stenosis cerebral hemorrhage Churg Strauss syndrome diabetes Ebstein s Anomaly Eisenmenger complex cholesterol embolism bacterial endocarditis fibromuscular dysplasia congenital heart defects heart diseases congestive heart failure heart valve diseases heart attack epidural hematoma hematoma subdural Hippel Lindau disease hyperemia hypertension pulmonary hypertension cardiac hypertrophy left ventricular hypertrophy right ventricular hypertrophy hypoplastic left heart syndrome hypotension intermittent claudication ischemic heart disease Klippel Trenaunay Weber syndrome lateral medullary syndrome long QT syndrome mitral valve prolapse moyamoya disease mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome myocardial infarction myocardial ischemia myocarditis pericarditis peripheral vascular diseases phlebitis polyarteritis nodosa pulmonary atresia Raynaud disease Sneddon syndrome superior vena cava syndrome syndrome X tachycardia Takayasu s arteritis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia telangiectasis temporal arteritis tetralogy of Fallot thromboangiitis obliterans thrombosis thromboembolism tricuspid atresia varicose veins vascular diseases vasculitis vasospasm ventricular fibrillation Williams syndrome peripheral vascular disease varicose veins and leg ulcers deep vein thrombosis Wolff Parkinson White syndrome.

Vascular diseases are often the result of decreased perfusion in the vascular system or physical or biochemical injury to the blood vessel.

Peripheral vascular disease PVD is defined as a disease of blood vessels often encountered as narrowing of the vessels of the limbs. There are two main types of these disorders functional disease which doesn t involve defects in the blood vessels but rather arises from stimuli such as cold stress or smoking and organic disease which arises from structural defects in the vasculature such as atherosclerotic lesions local inflammation or traumatic injury. This can lead to occlusion of the vessel aberrant blood flow and ultimately to tissue ischemia.

One of the more clinically significant forms of PVD is peripheral artery disease PAD . PAD is often treated by angioplasty and implantation of a stent or by artery bypass surgery. Clinical presentation depends on the location of the occluded vessel. For example narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the intestine can result in severe postprandial pain in the lower abdomen resulting from the inability of the occluded vessel to meet the increased oxygen demand arising from digestive and absorptive processes. In severe forms the ischemia can lead to intestinal necrosis. Similarly PAD in the leg can lead to intermittent pain usually in the calf that comes and goes with activity. This disorder is known as intermittent claudication IC and can progress to persistent pain while resting ischemic ulceration and even amputation. Peripheral vascular disease is also manifested in atherosclerotic stenosis of the renal artery which can lead to renal ischemia and kidney dysfunction.

One disease in which vascular diseases and their complications are very common is diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus causes a variety of physiological and anatomical irregularities the most prominent of which is the inability of the body to utilize glucose normally which results in hyperglycemia. Chronic diabetes can lead to complications of the vascular system which include atherosclerosis abnormalities involving large and medium size blood vessels macroangiopathy and abnormalities involving small blood vessels microangiopathy such as arterioles and capillaries.

Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing one or more foot ulcers as a result of established long term complications of the disease which include impaired nerve function neuropathy and or ischemia. Local tissue ischemia is a key contributing factor to diabetic foot ulceration.

In addition to large vessel disease patients with diabetes suffer further threat to their skin perfusion in at least two additional ways. First by involvement of the non conduit arteries which are detrimentally affected by the process of atherosclerosis and secondly and perhaps more importantly by impairment of the microcirculatory control mechanisms small vessel disease . Normally when a body part suffers some form of trauma the body part will as part of the body s healing mechanism experience an increased blood flow. When small vessel disease and ischemia are both present as in the case of many diabetics this natural increased blood flow response is significantly reduced. This fact together with the tendency of diabetics to form blood clots thrombosis in the microcirculatory system during low levels of blood flow is believed to be an important factor in ulcer pathogenesis.

Neuropathy is a general term which describes a disease process which leads to the dysfunction of the nervous system and is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus with no well established therapies for either its symptomatic treatment or for prevention of progressive decline in nerve function.

The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes primarily affect the eyes retinopathy and kidneys nephropathy . The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes are also associated with skin disorders and disorders of the nervous system neuropathy .

The eye diseases associated with diabetes are nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy proliferative diabetic retinopathy diabetic maculopathy glaucoma cataracts and the like.

Other diseases although not known to be related to diabetes are similar in their physiological effects on the peripheral vascular system. Such diseases include Raynaud syndrome CREST syndrome autoimmune diseases such as erythematosis rheumatoid disease and the like.

As used herein the term peripheral vascular diseases comprises any peripheral vascular disease including peripheral and autonomic neuropathies. Examples of peripheral vascular disease include peripheral arterial disease such as chronic arterial occlusion including arteriosclerosis arteriosclerosis obliterans and thromboangiitis obliterans Buerger s disease macroangiopathy microangiopathy diabetes mellitus thrombophlebitis phlebemphraxis Raynaud s disease Raynaud s syndrome CREST syndrome health hazard due to vibration Sudeck s syndrome intermittent claudication cold sense in extremities abnormal sensation in extremities sensitivity to the cold Meniere s disease Meniere s syndrome numbness lack of sensation anesthesia resting pain causalgia burning pain disturbance of peripheral circulation function disturbance of nerve function disturbance of motor function motor paralysis diabetic peripheral circulation disorder lumbar spinal canal stenosis diabetic neuropathy shock autoimmune disease such as erythematosis rheumatoid disease and rheumatoid arthritis autonomic neuropathy diabetic autonomic neuropathy autonomic imbalance orthostatic hypotension erectile dysfunction female sexual dysfunction retrograde ejaculation cystopathy neurogenic bladder defective vaginal lubrication exercise intolerance cardiac denervation heat intolerance gustatory sweating diabetic complication hyperglycemia hypoglycemia unawareness hypoglycemia unresponsiveness glaucoma neovascular glaucoma cataract retinopathy diabetic retinopathy diabetic maculopathy occlusion of retinal artery obstruction of central artery of retina occlusion of retinal vein macular edema aged macular degeneration aged disciform macular degeneration cystoid macular edema palpebral edema retinal edema chorioretinopathy neovascular maculopathy uveitis iritis retinal vasculitis endophthalmitis panophthalmitis metastatic ophthalmia choroiditis retinal pigment epithelitis conjunctivitis cyclitis scleritis episcleritis optic neuritis retrobulbar optic neuritis keratitis blepharitis exudative retinal detachment corneal ulcer conjunctival ulcer chronic nummular keratitis Thygeson keratitis progressive Mooren s ulcer damage of skin skin ulcer including foot ulcer diabetic ulcer burn ulcer lower leg ulcer postoperative ulcer traumatic ulcer ulcer after herpes zoster radiation ulcer drug induced ulcer frostbite cold injury chilblain gangrene and sudden gangrene angina pectoris variant angiitis coronary arteriosclerosis chronic ischemic heart disease asymptomatic ischemic heart disease arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction heart failure congestive heart failure and painless ischemic heart disease pulmonary edema hypertension pulmonary hypertension portal hypertension diabetic nephropathy decubitus renal failure.

The compounds and compositions of the invention may be administered enterally or parenterally. Mixed with pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries e.g. as described in the standard reference Gennaro et al. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences. The compounds may be compressed into solid dosage units such as pills tablets or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied in the form of a solution suspension emulsion e.g. for use as an injection preparation or eye drops or as a spray e.g. for use as a nasal spray.

For making dosage units e.g. tablets the use of conventional additives such as fillers colorants polymeric binders and the like is contemplated hi general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactose starch cellulose derivatives and the like or mixtures thereof used in suitable amounts.

The activities of GR agonists and their alteration of cellular functions are variable depending on complex intracellular molecular signaling that are cell and tissue specific. Amongst the cells that have glucocorticoid receptors are stem and progenitor cells of all tissues and organs of the body.

Thus binding of such molecules to normative in tissue stem cells and the progeny of these stem cells so called transit amplifying progenitor cells results in variable cell and tissue specific effects inhibitory or enhancing of stem and progenitor cell functions including activation proliferation migration and differentiation all of which are dependent on the tissue organ in question.

GR antagonists or active agents such as for example ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will thus block the effects of GR agonists in tissue specific fashion enhancing stem progenitor cell functioning in some inhibiting it in others. GR antagonists will have beneficial effects in specific clinical settings where regenerative medicine approaches to disease and wound healing may be of use including enhanced post transplant functioning of autologous stem cell transplants dependent on tissue of origin and or target tissue .

Attenuation of the peri surgical effects of catabolic stress hormones related to surgical or other physical traumas e.g. combat wounds wherein the acute or chronic injury or disease is selected from the group consisting of vascular events stroke cardiac arrest acute limb infarction accident battle field trauma traumatic limb hip brain injuries post surgical trauma major orthopedic thoracic abdominal neurological surgeries.

Systemic GR blockade will be inappropriate but direct application of ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof to site of injury wounding either topically for example to prevent wound dehiscence or by direct injection or intravascular infusion for visceral organ injuries will be beneficial.

The estimated daily cortisol production rate in normal subjects varies between 4 15 mg m.sup.2 per day or according to more recent studies between 9 and 11 mg m.sup.2 per day. In order to describe the 24 hour variation in serum cortisol levels adequately the day may be divided into for example four phases. Phase 1 is a 6 hours period of minimal secretory activity 4 h before and 2 h after onset of sleep. Phase 2 refers to the 3rd to 5th hours of sleep when there is a preliminary nocturnal secretory episode. Phase 3 is a 4 hour main secretory phase during the last 3 h of sleep and the first hour after wakening. Phase 4 is an 11 hour phase of intermittent secretory activity when there is a slow decline in serum levels of cortisol.

In a study by Mah et al. Clinical Endocrinology 2004 61 367 375 the circadian rhythm of serum cortisol of normal subjects is described. Peak levels of about 400 800 mmol 1 about 150 300 mmol 1 and about 150 mmol 1 are observed at about 6 am 2 m and 9 m respectively and the lowest level is about midnight. In this study it is observed that the endogenous cortisol levels reach their highest levels within 30 minutes after wake up. In order to mimic the circadian rhythm Mah et al. recommend a thrice daily treatment regimen of hydrocortisone the first dose taken in the fasted state and delaying the breakfast 1 3 hours and the other two doses taken 15 60 min before food. A trice daily regimen is also recommended in a recent review by Czock et al. Clin. Pharmacokinet 2005 44 61 98 due to the short half life of hydrocortisone and for prednisolone a twice daily regimen is preferred over a once daily regimen.

The absence of rapid response and inexpensive testing for cortisol has heretofore prevented the linking of GCR antagonists or active agents e.g. ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof to a cortisol pre test for entry into clinical trials for GCR antagonists and will inhibit the ability to select the patients most likely to receive the benefit of treatment with the compounds when available for clinical use. The invention provides the pairing of an affordable real time cortisol test e.g. PopTest Cortisol which will enable the successful completion of clinical trials for this class of drugs as well as form the basis for their future anticipated therapeutic use s .

Conditions that may be treated using for example a linked salivary cortisol quantification test and GCR antagonist or active agent e.g. ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof system include but are not limited to the following 

MDD is a psychiatric disorder which has a lifetime prevalence of around 8 . One of the most consistent findings in psychiatry is that patients with major depression present with alterations in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal HPA axis. A significant percentage of depressed patients exhibit hypersecretion cortisol as manifested by elevated plasma cerebrospinal fluid and salivary concentrations of cortisol and increased urinary free cortisol. In addition many depressed patients exhibit a clear inability to switch off endogenous cortisol release following exogenous challenge with the potent synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone the so called dexamethasone non suppressors Gold P. W. et al. Clinical and biochemical manifestations of depression relation to neurobiology of stress. New England J. Med. 319 413 420 1988 . This sub group of severely compromised patients are most often the ones in whom depression becomes a life threatening illness that warrants hospitalization.

Other abnormalities of the HPA axis found in depressed patients are increased cortisol response to corticotrophin a blunted corticotrophin response to CRH corticotrophin releasing hormone and adrenal and pituitary enlargement for a review see Holsboer F. and Barden N. Endocrine Reviews 1996 17 187 205 .

These observations have been interpreted to suggest a causal relationship between disturbed functioning of the HPA axis and the pathology of depression Murphy B. E. P. J. of Steroid Biochem. and Mol. Biol. 1991 38 537 559 . Therapeutic efficacy of classical antidepressants has been shown to be preceded by or to coincide with restoration of the disturbed HPA axis in depression Holsboer and Barden 1996 supra . It has been postulated that any intervention which can restore this HPA dysfunction may have antidepressant potential. One type of such intervention studies of which support the impression that HPA axis functioning and high circulating cortisol is a major instigator of major depression is the administration of glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitors as has been shown in patients suffering from Cushing s Syndrome which is a condition in which high cortisol levels are reported as a result of adrenal gland malfunction due to a pituitary tumour or a secondary tumour both producing the cortisol secretagogue ACTH . The depressive symptoms associated with Cushing s disappear relatively quickly with the return of cortisol levels to normal. Such treatment may involve removal of the offending tumour or treatment with cortisol synthesis inhibitors such as metyrapone ketoconozole or aminoglutethimide Murphy B. E. P Steroids and Depression. J. Steroid Biochem Mol. Biol. 38 537 558 1991 . Similarly relatively recent clinical trials have demonstrated that cortisol synthesis inhibitors can be used to ameliorate depressive symptoms in severe treatment resistant non Cushing depressives Murphy B. E. P Can. J. Psych. 43 279 286 1998 see also U.S. Pat. No. 4 814 333 Ravaris C. L. .

Another type of intervention is the use of direct GCR antagonists which have much more specific pharmacological effects as compared to synthesis inhibitors and which may help restore HPA activity. Small scale pilot clinical studies have been conducted in order to study the antidepressant activity of the non selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 mifepristone Murphy B. E. P. et al. J. Psychiat. Neurosc. 18 209 213 1993 . More recently Nemeroff C. Remeron Scientific Expert Meeting Budapest Mar. 29 Apr. 1 2001 it was demonstrated in a Phase IIB continuation of this study that both the number of responders as well as the efficacy of the psychosis treatment increased with increasing daily dose of mifepristone as measured by the change in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 50 mg 33 change 600 mg 40 change and 1200 mg 52 change . These data indicate that a higher dose of glucocorticoid receptor antagonist and or active agent is correlated with a higher clinical efficacy.

Non response to standard treatments however reach levels as high as 50 . Connolly K R Drugs. 2011 71 43 64. Frequently extra interventions are necessary to get patients to achieve remission. Various augmentation and combination strategies have been described in the literature for difficult to treat major MMD patients.

Use of an HPA axis modulating drug in these patients has not been studied in spite of the fact that there is clear evidence that at least a sub group of MDD patients have significant HPA axis dysfunction as noted above. Biological symptoms indicative of excessive activity of the HPA axis have been reported with great consistency. In parallel there is a body of evidence suggesting that there is an association between HPA axis functioning and treatment response where high HPA axis activation at baseline or post treatment is associated with a poorer response to SSRI treatment or a higher relapse risk.

Preclinical studies indicate that HPA axis dysfunction of the type seen in affective disorders can attenuate the neurochemical effects of a selective serotonin re uptake inhibitor SSRI antidepressant. Conversely in animals with normal HPA axis function co administration of GR antagonists augmented the neurochemical effects of an SSRI. These data provide a mechanistic underpinning of the GR antagonist augmentation strategy and moreover indicate that the strategy may prove efficacious in patients both with and without HPA axis dysfunction.

Small scale pilot clinical studies were conducted in order to study the antidepressant activity of the non selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 mifepristone Murphy B. E. P. et al. J. Psychiat. Neurosc. 18 209 213 1993 . A double blind 4 week paroxetine controlled study of PT150 ORG 34517 in depressed patients was carried out. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin re uptake inhibitor which is recognized as an effective antidepressant for major depression. Patients were selected which had a primary depressive disorder fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of a MDD as defined by the DSM 1V for recurrent 296.3 episodes and who had a severity of depression which resulted in a total score of at least 22 on the HAMD 21 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression see Hamilton M. A rating scale for depression. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiat. 1960 23 56 62 scale at baseline. Patients had an episode of depression which had lasted at least 2 weeks before baseline.

In this study patients were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups. Group I patients 50 patients received 2 capsules with 75 mg of PT150 and one placebo total daily dose 150 mg for the first 2 weeks and 2 capsules with 75 mg PT150 and 1 capsule with 150 mg total daily dose 300 mg the next 2 weeks Group II patients 46 patients received 3 capsules with 150 mg PT150 total daily dose 450 mg in the first 2 weeks and 4 capsules of PT150 total daily dose 600 mg in the next 2 weeks Group III patients 44 patients received 2 capsules with 10 mg paroxetine and one placebo capsule total daily dose 20 mg for the first 2 weeks followed by 2 capsules of 10 mg and one capsule of 20 mg paroxetine total daily dose 40 mg in the next 2 weeks. Medication was administered orally in the morning. Efficacy assessment was done on days 4 7 10 14 21 28 and 35 by using the 21 item HAMD scale.

Thus GCR antagonist or active agent therapy could prove a useful mechanism for treatment of selected individuals who fail to respond to current anti depressant therapies such as SSRIs providing a way to enhance responsiveness or as an alternate means of achieving a maintained euthymia.

The present invention relates to the use of a GCR antagonist such as for example ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the prevention or treatment of psychotic depression. Psychotic major depression has long been recognized as a distinct psychiatric illness having both psychotic and depressive components in a differential diagnosis. Psychotic major depression is very common. It has been estimated that twenty five percent of depressed patients admitted to the hospital have psychotic major depression Coryell 1984 J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. 172 521 . Like major depression psychotic depression is often also a result of high circulating cortisol levels. Various evidence supports this concept. Psychosis has been associated with Cushing s syndrome Gerson 1985 Can. J. Psychiatry 30 223 224 Saad 1984 Am. J. Med. 76 759 766 . A GR antagonist has been used to treat acute psychiatric disturbances secondary to Cushing s syndrome. One study showed that a relatively high dose of such a GR antagonist 400 to 800 mg per day was useful in rapidly reversing acute psychosis in patients with severe Cushing s Syndrome due to adrenal cancers and ectopic secretion of ACTH from lung cancer Van der Lely 1991 Ann. Intern. Med. 114 143 Van der Lely 1993 Pharmacy World Science 15 89 90 Sartor 1996 supra . Relatively high dose mifepristone in the range of 8 12 mg kg day over a relatively short period of time 4 days was also shown to be effective in the treatment of psychosis associated with psychotic major depression International Patent Application WO 99 17779 Schatzberg and Belanoff .

In healthy young to middle aged subjects suffering from stress there is a physiological balance between pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory mediators. In the elderly the immune response is blunted as a result of the decline in several components of the immune system immune senescence and a shifting to a chronic pro inflammatory status the so called inflammaging effect Butcher and Lord 2004 Aging Cell pp. 151 160 .

As production of cortisol remains reasonably constant with age whereas summed levels of DHEA and DHEAS decrease gradually from the third decade reaching 10 20 of their maximum by the eighth decade Butcher and Lord 2004 supra propose a model for age and stress in which the age related increase in the ratio of cortisol to DHEAS combined with an elevated cortisol release during stress leads to a significant reduction of immunity in aging subjects. This is proposed to explain that aging subjects are far more prone to infections under conditions of stress. Butcher and Lord 2004 supra Butcher et al. 2005 Aging Cell 5 pp. 319 324 .

The present invention relates to the use of a GCR antagonist such as for example ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the prevention or treatment of infections or infectious conditions in an aging patient such as a human subject. The beneficial effects of said GCR antagonists may be explained on the basis of their correcting influence on the cortisol DHEA S ratio. It is believed that the effect in selected subjects found to have high circulating cortisol by a saliva test as provided for by this invention can be explained by the unbalanced immunosuppressive role of the increased cortisol DHEAS ratio in the aged group in comparison to the balanced influence of cortisol and DHEAS on the immune system in normal subjects.

The meaning of the term aging subject or aged subject will be well understood in the context of the use according to this invention. Although it is not linked to an exact lower age limit this general notion refers in the human situation usually to a person of at least 55 years old but it is more clear with a lowest age limit set at 60 65 70 or 75 years.

In the context of the invention the infection or infectious condition can be caused by any of several agents e.g. by bacteria by viruses or by fungi. Also in the context of the present invention the expression infectious conditions means silent or subclinical infections as well as conditions not resulting in a manifest infectious disease but in which at least one parameter associated with an infectious disease such as the white blood e.g. neutrophil basophil or eosinophil cell counts or the level of some antibodies or some cytokines is higher than normal. Normal values are known to the expert and may be found in standard medical manuals. Particular uses according to the invention relate to aging subjects suffering from an infection or an infectious condition concomitant to stress resulting from a trauma. The invention particularly relates to uses wherein the subject suffers from the consequences of a bone fracture and or bone surgery either for such injury or for joint replacement for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The invention also relates to uses wherein the subject suffers from an infection or an infectious condition concomitant to psychological stress particularly acute emotional stress.

PTSD is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that results in psychological trauma. This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else or to one s own or someone else s physical sexual or psychological integrity overwhelming the individual s ability to cope. As an effect of psychological trauma PTSD is less frequent and more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response. Diagnostic symptoms for PTSD include re experiencing the original trauma s through flashbacks or nightmares avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and increased arousal such as difficulty falling or staying asleep anger and hyper vigilance. Formal diagnostic criteria both DSM IV TR and ICD 9 require that the symptoms last more than one month and cause significant impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders DSM IV. American Psychiatric Association. 1994. Washington D.C. American Psychiatric Association. 

PTSD displays biochemical changes in the brain and body that differ from other psychiatric disorders such as major depression. Abundant evidence suggests derangement of HPA axis physiology in individuals diagnosed with PTSD though the nature of the derangements is variable some have low cortisol some have normal levels others have high levels of cortisol and for some levels may be normal but circadian rhythm is lost. It is postulated that these reflect different baseline mechanisms but that when cortisol is high either in a sustained way through the day or by loss of circadian rhythm with elevated night time levels it is likely to be an important component of the clinical symptomatology Lindley S E et al. Basal and dexamethasone suppressed salivary cortisol concentrations in a community sample of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Biol. Psychiatry 2004 55 940 5 . In such patients determined by salivary cortisol testing administration of a GCR antagonist is expected to be therapeutic or beneficial for the symptoms of PTSD. Prevention of Weight Gain in Patients Using Anti Psychotic and Anti Depressant Medications. Anti psychotic and some anti depressant medications e.g. SSRIs are amongst the most important tools for treating psychiatric conditions of all kinds. However management of patients on who take many of these medications for chronic long term disease is made difficult by their significant side effect profiles. One of the most important of these is weight gain and the attendant metabolic syndrome that follows. For example it is estimated that 40 80 of patients who are under chronic anti psychotic administration experience substantial weight gain often exceeding 20 or more over their ideal body weights Umbricht et al. J. Clin. Psychiatry 1994 55 157 160 Khan A Y et al. J Psychiatr Pract. 2010 16 289 96 Pramyothin P Khaodhiar L. Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes. 2010 17 460 6 Rummel Kluge C et al. Schizophr Res. 2010 123 225 33 . Such weight gain is one of the most common causes of poor compliance with anti psychotic and anti depressant regimens and therefore of long term failure of therapy. Furthermore anti psychotic medications specifically are commonly associated with development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome with development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyper dyslipidemia states and the potentially and significantly increased risks for cardiovascular disease these conditions are of tremendous medical consequence for patients who are thereby caught in a can t live with them can t live without them treatment scenario. While weight gain is potentially seen with all anti psychotic medications they are particularly common and tend to more severe with the newer or atypical AP drugs Allison et al. Am J Psychiatry 1999 156 1686 1696 Rummel Kluge C et al. Schizophr Res. 2010 123 225 33 .

Elevations in cortisol are associated with changes in body fat and insulin resistance. Several years ago in a proof of principle clinical experiment it was reported that one GCR antagonist mifepristone was a highly effective treatment for multiple medical complications in a patient with Cushing s disease whose illness had not responded to surgery and radiation including reversal of insulin dependent diabetes the patient was able to stop insulin within a month Chu et al. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001 86 3568 3573. . These data suggest that a GCR antagonist could be useful for blocking and reversing the insulin resistance and weight changes seen in some patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents. To this end this compound was tested in rats who had olanzapine induced weight gain and increases in abdominal fat reversal of weight gain was seen and reduction of abdominal fat was obtained Beebe et al. Behav. Brain Res. 2006 171 225 229 . A clinical trial with this compound then confirmed this benefit in humans with a 2 week study of 600 mg day of mifepristone that reduced olanzapine induced weight gain in 57 non overweight healthy males with Body Mass Indices less than 25 Gross et al. Adv Ther. 2009 26 959 69. . Thus GCR antagonist or active agent therapy could prove a useful mechanism to target in treating psychotic patients with atypical antipsychotic agents. The present invention relates to the use of a GCR antagonist such as for example ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the prevention or treatment of PTSD.

Cushing s Syndrome is a set of conditions in which high levels of circulating cortisol or other GCR agonists cause a set of seriously debilitating and sometimes life threatening signs and symptoms including but not limited to psychiatric disturbances e.g. anxiety depression psychosis immunosuppression insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome skin conditions hypertension and osteoporosis. Endogenous cortisol may be produced by ACTH secreting benign or malignant tumors of the pituitary gland Cushing s Disease or of the adrenal cortex. These are rare conditions and therefore Cushing s Syndrome is considered an orphan disease. A proof of concept trial using RU486 to treat patients with tumor related Cushing s Syndrome demonstrated efficacy in remitting symptoms such as glucose metabolic abnormalities i.e. glucose intolerance group 1 and hypertension group 2 . Statistically significant improvement was achieved for both groups with 60 responding in the glucose intolerant group and 43 in the hypertensive group Corcept Therapeutics Press Release Dec. 22 2010 . Thus GCR antagonist or active agent therapy can be expected to provide clinical benefits for patients with Cushing s Syndrome administered prior to tumor surgery to improve surgical outcomes and or post surgery to mitigate symptoms in patients for whom surgical cure is not achievable.

In addition GCR antagonist or active agent therapy can be expected to provide clinical benefits for patients for example in hospitals nursing homes nurseries daycares schools work environments public transportation healthcare settings psychiatric institutions and long term nursing facilities.

The present invention relates to the use of a GCR antagonist such as for example ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the prevention or treatment of Cushing s Syndrome.

A diagnostic kit may comprise some or all of the following components 1 one or more standards comprised of one or more of the biomarker s of the invention such as cortisol 2 a ligand such as an antibody or a plurality of antibodies that are specific for the biomarker s that are to be assayed for using the kit 3 written instructions 4 diluents for samples and the standards 5 a wash buffer 6 color reagents 7 stop solution and 8 a ligand carrier such as an antibody carrier for example a lateral flow device or a microplate with bound antibody or polystyrene beads.

An example of such a kit is a quantitative ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay that determines the concentration or concentrations of the biomarker or biomarker s in accordance with methods embodied by the invention. The principle of the assay is to use the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique wherein a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody selective for a biomarker is pre coated onto a carrier such as a microplate into its wells. The standards and sample are then pipetted into the wells and any of the biomarker that is present is bound to this immobilized antibody. Next the wells are washed with washing buffer and an enzyme linked monoclonal or polyclonal antibody that is specific for the biomarker is added to the wells.

Washing is again performed then a substrate solution is added to the wells. Color subsequently develops in proportion to the amount of polypeptide of the invention that is bound in the first step. The color development is stopped using a stop solution and the intensity of the color is measured by a microplate reader.

The methods of the invention may be carried out using for example a lateral flow assay. Such lateral flow assays have the potential to be a cost effective fast simple and sensitive method for instance for on site screening assays. The lateral flow assay comprises a carrier that allows a lateral flow to occur wherein either the sample or the detection reagent is displaced form one location on the carrier to another. There are many formats of lateral flow assays suitable for use in a method embodied by the invention and the skilled person will readily know how to select and optimize a particular format. An example of a lateral flow test strip of the invention comprises for example the following components 

2. Conjugate or reagent pad this contains antibodies specific to the target analyte conjugated to colored particles usually colloidal gold particles or latex microspheres .

3. Reaction membrane typically a hydrophobic nitrocellulose or cellulose acetate membrane onto which antitarget analyte antibodies are immobilized in a line across the membrane as a capture zone or test line a control zone may also be present containing antibodies specific for the conjugate antibodies . 4. Wick or waste reservoir a further absorbent pad designed to draw the sample across the reaction membrane by capillary action and collect it. Double Antibody Sandwich Assays 

In this format the sample migrates from the sample pad through the conjugate pad where any target analyte present will bind to the conjugate. The sample then continues to migrate across the membrane until it reaches the capture zone where the target conjugate complex will bind to the immobilized antibodies producing a visible line on the membrane. The sample then migrates further along the strip until it reaches the control zone where excess conjugate will bind and produce a second visible line on the membrane. This control line indicates that the sample has migrated across the membrane as intended. Two clear lines on the membrane is a positive result.

A single line in the control zone is a negative result. Double antibody sandwich assays are most suitable for larger analytes such as bacterial pathogens and viruses with multiple antigenic sites. Competitive assays are primarily used for testing small molecules and differ from the double antibody sandwich format in that the conjugate pad contains antibodies that are already bound to the target analyte or to an analogue of it. If the target analyte is present in the sample it will therefore not bind with the conjugate and will remain unlabelled.

As the sample migrates along the membrane and reaches the capture zone an excess of unlabelled analyte will bind to the immobilized antibodies and block the capture of the conjugate so that no visible line is produced.

The unbound conjugate will then bind to the antibodies in the control zone producing a visible control line. A single control line on the membrane is a positive result. Two visible lines in the capture and control zones is a negative result. However if an excess of unlabelled target analyte is not present a weak line may be produced in the capture zone indicating an inconclusive result. Competitive assays are most suitable for testing for small molecules such as mycotoxins unable to bind to more than one antibody simultaneously. There are a number of variations on lateral flow technology. The capture zone on the membrane may contain immobilized antigens or enzymes depending on the target analyte rather than antibodies. It is also possible to apply multiple capture zones to create a multiplex test. For example commercial test strips able to detect both EHEC Shiga toxins ST1 and ST2 separately in the same sample have been developed. Lateral flow immunoassays are simple to use by untrained operators and generally produce a result within 15 minutes. They are very stable and robust have a long shelf life and do not usually require refrigeration. They are also relatively inexpensive to produce. These features make them ideal for use at the point of care and for testing samples in the field as well as in the laboratory. However their sensitivity is limited without additional concentration or culture procedures.

While most lateral flow immunoassays are only capable of providing a qualitative result it is possible to obtain some degree of quantification by measuring the amount of conjugate bound to the capture zone. This can be done using a dedicated reader to measure the intensity of the colored test line. For example the Neogen Corporation has developed the Accuscan lateral flow reader for use with its range of Reveal assay kits and Charm Sciences also supplies a reader for its Rosa range of mycotoxin test strips. More sophisticated techniques such as fluorescent dye labeled conjugates have also been developed to improve the quantitative potential of lateral flow assays. Applications in the 20 years since the first lateral flow test was launched have expanded to include a huge range of different tests that have been developed based on the same technology. The first commercially available kits were aimed at the clinical diagnostics field but there are now products with applications in almost every branch of microbiology. Clinical microbiology lateral flow tests have been developed for bacterial pathogens respiratory and enteric viruses intestinal parasites and bacterial toxins. Many of the lateral flow immunoassay products designed for the clinical sector were intended to be used at the point of care for direct testing of fecal blood and urine samples and nose and throat swabs where the simple operation and speed of the tests is key to their use outside of the laboratory. However the same test strips may also be useful as a quick confirmatory test following laboratory culture of clinical samples. Food and agricultural microbiology test strips are available for food borne bacterial pathogens bacterial and fungal toxins. In the food microbiology sector the main applications are more likely to be in the laboratory although there are field test kits for mycotoxins in grain samples. Testing for food borne bacterial pathogens generally involves at least one enrichment stage before the assay strip is used to confirm the presence or absence of the pathogen. Some manufacturers such as Dupont have developed enrichment media and methods specifically designed for use with lateral flow test strips. Test strips may also be useful for rapid confirmation of the identity of bacterial isolates from conventional microbiological testing.

A diagnostic system in kit form of the present invention includes for example in an amount sufficient for at least one assay a polypeptide antibody composition or monoclonal antibody composition of the present invention as a packaged reagent. Instructions for use of the packaged reagent are also typically included.

A diagnostic system in kit form of the present invention may include for example a means for detecting the presence of a biological substance in a test sample comprising for example a lollipop like apparatus including a stem integrated with the base and a head integrated with the stem for collecting a test sample consisting of for example saliva or a bodily fluid sample from a subject. The stem head may include a receptor of a sponge like carrier to ensure a high void volume to absorb sufficient saliva or bodily fluid sample. See U.S. Pat. No. 7 993 283 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

A diagnostic system in kit form of the present invention may include for example a means for combining the test sample with a buffering system Reagent 1 containing viscosity controllers and stabilizers into a reaction vessel and mixing the solution. A diagnostic system in kit form of the present invention may include for example a means for reading the a parameter of the reaction vessel with sample and buffer and further means for combining the test sample and buffer mixture with a fluorescence labeled ligand Reagent 2 to said biological substance in the reaction vessel mixing the solution to produce an assay solution. Furthermore Reagent 2 may be delivered to the reaction vessel without further dilution volume of the assay solution.

As used herein the term package refers to a solid matrix or material such as glass plastic paper foil and the like capable of holding within fixed limits a polypeptide antibody composition or monoclonal antibody composition of the present invention. Thus for example a package can be a glass vial used to contain milligram quantities of a contemplated polypeptide or it can be a microtiter plate well to which microgram quantities of a contemplated polypeptide have been operatively affixed i.e. linked so as to be capable of being immunologically bound by an antibody.

 Instructions for use typically include a tangible expression describing the reagent concentration or at least one assay method parameter such as the relative amounts of reagent and sample to be admixed maintenance time periods for reagent sample admixtures temperature buffer conditions and the like.

In preferred embodiments a diagnostic system of the present invention further includes a label or indicating means capable of signaling the formation of a complex containing a polypeptide or antibody molecule of the present invention.

The word complex as used herein refers to the product of a specific binding reaction such as an antibody antigen or receptor ligand reaction. Exemplary complexes are immunoreaction products.

As used herein the terms label and indicating means in their various grammatical forms refer to single atoms and molecules that are either directly or indirectly involved in the production of a detectable signal to indicate the presence of a complex. Any label or indicating means can be linked to or incorporated in an expressed protein polypeptide or antibody molecule that is part of an antibody or monoclonal antibody composition of the present invention or used separately and those atoms or molecules can be used alone or in conjunction with additional reagents such labels are themselves well known in clinical diagnostic chemistry and constitute a part of this invention only insofar as they are utilized with otherwise novel proteins methods and or systems.

The labeling means can be a fluorescent labeling agent that chemically binds to antibodies or antigens without denaturing them to form a fluorochrome dye that is a useful immunofluorescent tracer. Suitable fluorescent labeling agents are fluorochromes such as fluorescein isocyanate FIC fluorescein isothiocyante FITC 5 dimethylamine 1 naphthalenesulfonyl chloride DANSC tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate TRITC lissamine rhodamine 8200 sulphonyl chloride RB 200 SC and the like. A description of immunofluorescence analysis techniques is found in DeLuca Immunofluorescence Analysis in Antibody As a Tool Marchalonis et al. eds. John Wiley Sons Ltd. pp. 189 231 1982 which is incorporated herein by reference.

In preferred embodiments the indicating group is an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase HRP glucose oxidase or the like. In such cases where the principal indicating group is an enzyme such as HRP or glucose oxidase additional reagents are required to visualize the fact that a receptor ligand complex immunoreactant has formed. Such additional reagents for HRP include hydrogen peroxide and an oxidation dye precursor such as diaminobenzidine. An additional reagent useful with glucose oxidase is 2 2 azino di 3 ethyl benzthiazoline G sulfonic acid ABTS .

Radioactive elements are also useful labeling agents and are used illustratively herein. An exemplary radiolabeling agent is a radioactive element that produces gamma ray emissions. Elements which themselves emit gamma rays such as .sup. 1241 .sup. 1251 .sup. 1281 .sup. 1321 and sup.51Cr represent one class of gamma ray emission producing radioactive element indicating groups. Particularly preferred is .sup. 1251. Another group of useful labeling means are those elements such as .sup.11C sup 18F .sup.150 and sup 13N which themselves emit positrons. The positrons so emitted produce gamma rays upon encounters with electrons present in the animal s body. Also useful is a beta emitter such .sup.lllindium or sup.3H.

The linking of labels i.e. labeling of polypeptides and proteins is well known in the art. For instance antibody molecules produced by a hybridoma can be labeled by metabolic incorporation of radioisotope containing amino acids provided as a component in the culture medium. See for example Galfire et al. Meth. Enzymol. 73 3 46 1981 . The techniques of protein conjugation or coupling through activated functional groups are particularly applicable. See for example Aurameas et al. Scand. J. Immunol. Vol. 8 Suppl. 7 7 23 1978 Rodwell et al. Biotech. 3 889 894 1984 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 493 795 which are all incorporated herein by reference.

The diagnostic systems can also include preferably as a separate package a specific binding agent. A specific binding agent is a molecular entity capable of selectively binding a reagent species of the present invention or a complex containing such a species but is not itself a polypeptide or antibody molecule composition of the present invention. Exemplary specific binding agents are second antibody molecules complement proteins or fragments thereof protein A and the like. Preferably the specific binding agent binds the reagent species when that species is present as part of a complex.

In preferred embodiments the specific binding agent is labeled. However when the diagnostic system includes a specific binding agent that is not labeled the agent is typically used as an amplifying means or reagent. In these embodiments the labeled specific binding agent is capable of specifically binding the amplifying means when the amplifying means is bound to a reagent species containing complex.

The diagnostic kits of the present invention can be used in an ELISA format to detect for example the presence or quantity of cortisol in a body fluid sample such as serum plasma or urine etc. ELISA refers to an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay that employs an antibody or antigen bound to a solid phase and an enzyme antigen or enzyme antibody conjugate to detect and quantify the amount of an antigen or antibody present in a sample. A description of the ELISA technique is found in Chapter 22 of the 4th Edition of Basic and Clinical Immunology by D. P. Sites et al. published by Lange Medical Publications of Los Altos Calif. in 1982 and in U.S. Pat. No. 3 654 090 U.S. Pat. No. 3 850 752 and U.S. Pat.

Thus for example a polypeptide antibody molecule composition or monoclonal antibody molecule composition of the present invention can be affixed to a solid matrix to form a solid support that comprises a package in the subject diagnostic systems. The reagent is typically affixed to the solid matrix by adsorption from an aqueous medium although other modes of affixation well known to those skilled in the art can be used.

Useful solid matrices are also well known in the art. Such materials are water insoluble and include cross linked dextran agarose beads of polystyrene beads about 1 micron to about 5 millimeters in diameter polyvinyl chloride polystyrene cross linked polyacrylamide nitrocellulose or nylon based webs such as sheets strips or paddles or tubes plates or the wells of a microtiter plate such as those made from polystyrene or polyvinylchloride.

The reagent species labeled specific binding agent or amplifying reagent of any diagnostic system described herein can be provided in solution as a liquid dispersion or as a substantially dry power e.g. in lyophilized form. Where the indicating means is an enzyme the enzyme s substrate can also be provided in a separate package of a system. A solid support such as the before described microtiter plate and one or more buffers can also be included as separately packaged elements in this diagnostic assay system.

The packaging materials discussed herein in relation to diagnostic systems are those customarily utilized in diagnostic systems. Such materials include glass and plastic e.g. polyethylene polypropylene and polycarbonate bottles vials plastic and plastic foil laminated envelopes and the like. In one embodiment a diagnostic system of the present invention is useful for assaying for the presence of for example cortisol. Such a system comprises in kit form a package containing an antibody to for example cortisol.

 Sample refers to for example essentially any source from which materials of interest to be analyzed e.g. ligands and antiligands such as antibodies and antigens and nucleic acids and their complements can be obtained. A sample may be acquired from essentially any organism including animals and plants as well as cell cultures recombinant cells and cell components. Samples can be from a biological tissue fluid or specimen and may be obtained from a diseased or healthy organism. Samples may include but are not limited to saliva sputum amniotic fluid blood blood cells e.g. white cells urine semen peritoneal fluid pleural fluid tissue or fine needle biopsy samples and tissue homogenates. Samples may also include sections of tissues such as frozen sections taken for histological purposes. Typically samples are taken from a human. However samples can be obtained from other mammals also including by way of example and not limitation dogs cats sheep cattle and pigs. The sample may be pretreated as necessary by dilution in an appropriate buffer solution or concentrated if desired. Any of a number of standard aqueous buffer solutions employing one of a variety of buffers such as phosphate Tris or the like preferably at physiological pH can be used.

Biological samples can be derived from patients using well known techniques such as venipuncture lumbar puncture fluid sample such as saliva or urine or tissue biopsy and the like. When the biological material is derived from non humans such as commercially relevant livestock blood and tissue samples are conveniently obtained from livestock processing plants. Alternatively a biological sample may be obtained from a cell or blood bank where tissue and or blood are stored or from an in vitro source such as a culture of cells.

Techniques for establishing a culture of cells for use as a source for biological materials are well known to those of skill in the art.

In one embodiment the sample is selected from or is derived from for example microbial products or biological products.

Although the above described example relates to the antigens relating to disease the immunoassay apparatus could be used for example as an allergy test kit as a test kit for drugs of abuse or for analyzing non human derived samples e.g. bovine porcine and veterinary tests. Specific reagents used in the assay device will be selected so as to ensure that the particular target analyte is detected as is well known in the art. The target analyte may be any analyte for example a chemical reagent which may be organic or inorganic and which optionally comprises a hapten a protein a polypeptide a microorganism or a nucleic acid sequence.

In particular the analyte is a hormone such as a fertility hormone like progesterone or a stress hormone such as cortisol. However there is a wide range of applications of these types of tests across the entire field of diagnostics and analysis. Detection of marker proteins or hormones can be diagnostic of certain disease conditions in humans or animals and the presence of drugs or drug residues may also be required to be detected for example in animal husbandry forensic medicine or in the testing for banned or prohibited drug substances.

Alternatively the analyte is a chemical reagent for instance a small molecule which suitably comprises a hapten. Small molecules will generally comprise a single recognizable binding site. Typically they will have a molecular weight of less than 1 kDa.

Where the assay utilizes a labelled binding partner for the analyte and the analyte is a chemical reagent the binding partner may comprise any other reagent which reacts with or otherwise becomes associated with the chemical reagent either because it forms covalent or ionic bonds with the reagent or by the formation of other interactions such as hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals interactions. For example where the chemical reagent is an acid the binding partner may comprise an alcohol or an amine that forms an ester or amide with the acid under the sorts of conditions found in the test. Alternatively the binding partner may comprise a base that forms a salt with the acid. Conversely where the binding partner may comprise the acid part of the reactive pair.

Where the analyte is or comprises a hapten or a protein antigen the binding partner may comprise an antibody or a binding fragment thereof which may be monoclonal polyclonal or recombinant but preferably is monoclonal. Where the analyte is a hormone or enzyme the labelled binding partner may comprise a labelled receptor for the analyte. However where the analyte is itself an immunoglobulin and in particular an antibody the labelled binding partner may also comprise for instance an antigen or recombinant antigen as well as antiantibody immunoglobulin such as anti sera.

Antibodies or binding fragments to small molecules such as haptens are generated by attaching the molecule to an immunogenic reagent and administering this to an animal such as a mouse or rabbit. Antibodies are then harvested from the animal in the usual way. Monoclonal antibodies are obtained by fusing spleen cells to hybridoma cells and selecting those which bind the hapten using routine procedures.

For example where the analyte is a biologically active material such as an active agrochemical as discussed above specific reagents used in the assay device will be selected so as to ensure that the particular target biologically active material is detected as is well known in the art. The biologically active material may be any active chemical such as an agrochemical for example a chemical reagent which may be organic or inorganic and which optionally comprises a hapten a protein a polypeptide a microorganism or a nucleic acid sequence. Most preferably the biologically active material is a chemical reagent for instance a small molecule which suitably comprises a hapten. Small molecules will generally have a single antibody binding site. Typically they will have a molecular weight of less that 1 kDa.

Antibodies or binding fragments to small molecules such as haptens are generated by attaching the molecule to an immunogenic reagent and administering this to an animal such as a mouse or rabbit. Antibodies are then harvested from the animal in the usual way. Monoclonal antibodies are obtained by fusing spleen cells to hybridoma cells and selecting those which bind the hapten using routine procedures.

The method of the invention is particularly useful in combination with the analysis of gene expression profiles. In some embodiments a gene expression profile such as a collection of transcription rates of a number of genes is converted to a projected gene expression profile. The projected gene expression profile is a collection of expression values. The conversion is achieved in some embodiments by averaging the transcription rate of the genes. In some other embodiments other linear projection processes may be used.

Microarrays may be prepared and analyzed using methods known in the art. Oligonucleotides may be used as either probes or targets in a microarray. The microarray can be used to monitor the expression level of large numbers of genes simultaneously and to identify genetic variants mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Such information may be used to determine gene function to understand the genetic basis of a condition disease or disorder to diagnose a condition disease or disorder and to develop and monitor the activities of therapeutic agents. See e.g. Brennan et al. 1995 U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 796 Schena et al. 1996 Proc. Natd. Acad. Sci. 93 10614 10619 Baldeschweiler et al. 1995 PCT application WO95 251116 Shalon et al. 1995 PCT application WO95 35505 Heller et al. 1997 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 94 2150 2155 and Heller et al. 1997 U.S. Pat. No. 5 605 662. Hybridization probes are also useful in mapping the naturally occurring genomic sequence. The sequences may be mapped to a particular chromosome to a specific region of a chromosome or to artificial chromosome constructions e.g. human artificial chromosomes HACs yeast artificial chromosomes YACs bacterial artificial chromosomes BACs bacterial PI constructions or single chromosome DNA libraries.

Using the methods of the invention a skilled artisan can readily select and prepare probes for a microarray wherein the microarray contains specific individual probes for less than all the genes in the genome and less than all the genes in the genome. In such embodiments the microarray contains one or two or more individual probes each of which hybridizes to an expression product e.g. mRNA or cDNA or cRNA derived therefrom for a desired number of genes. Thus for example changes in the expression of all or most of the genes in the entire genome of a cell or organism can thereby be monitored by use of a surrogate and on a single microarray by measuring expression of the group of genes that are representative of all or most of the genes of the genome. Such microarrays can be prepared using the selected probes and are therefore part of the present invention.

Stroke also referred to herein as acute stroke ischemic stroke and or cerebrovascular ischemia is often cited as the third most common cause of death in the industrial world ranking behind ischemic heart disease and cancer. Strokes are responsible for about 300 000 deaths annually in the United States and are a leading cause of hospital admissions and long term disabilities. Accordingly the socioeconomic impact of stroke and its attendant burden on society is practically immeasurable.

 Stroke is defined by the World Health Organization as a rapidly developing clinical sign of focal or global disturbance of cerebral function with symptoms lasting at least 24 hours. Strokes are also implicated in deaths where there is no apparent cause other than an effect of vascular origin. Strokes are typically caused by blockages or occlusions of the blood vessels to the brain or within the brain.

With complete occlusion arrest of cerebral circulation causes cessation of neuronal electrical activity within seconds. Within a few minutes after the deterioration of the energy state and ion homeostasis depletion of high energy phosphates membrane ion pump failure efflux of cellular potassium influx of sodium chloride and water and membrane depolarization occur. If the occlusion persists for more than five to ten minutes irreversible damage results. With incomplete ischemia however the outcome is difficult to evaluate and depends largely on residual perfusion and the availability of oxygen. After a thrombotic occlusion of a cerebral vessel ischemia is rarely total. Some residual perfusion usually persists in the ischemic area depending on collateral blood flow and local perfusion pressure.

A subject having a stroke is so diagnosed by symptoms experienced and or by a physical examination including interventional and non interventional diagnostic tools such as CT and MR imaging. The methods of the invention are advantageous for the treatment of various clinical presentations of stroke subjects. A subject having a stroke may present with one or more of the following symptoms paralysis weakness decreased sensation and or vision numbness tingling aphasia e.g. inability to speak or slurred speech difficulty reading or writing agnosia i.e. inability to recognize or identify sensory stimuli loss of memory co ordination difficulties lethargy sleepiness or unconsciousness lack of bladder or bowel control and cognitive decline e.g. dementia limited attention span inability to concentrate . Using medical imaging techniques it may be possible to identify a subject having a stroke as one having an infarct or one having hemorrhage in the brain.

The present invention relates to the use of a GCR antagonist such as for example ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the prevention or treatment of stroke.

The treatment and or prevention of infection after stroke can be for patients who have experienced a stroke or can be a prophylactic treatment. Short term prophylactic treatment is indicated for subjects having surgical or diagnostic procedures which risk release of emboli lowering of blood pressure or decrease in blood flow to the brain to reduce the injury due to any ischemic event that occurs as a consequence of the procedure. Longer term or chronic prophylactic treatment is indicated for subjects having cardiac conditions that may lead to decreased blood flow to the brain or conditions directly affecting brain vasculature. If prophylactic then the treatment is for subjects having an abnormally elevated risk of an ischemic stroke as described above. If the subject has experienced a stroke then the treatment can include acute treatment. Acute treatment for prevention of infection after stroke in a patient means administration of an agent of the invention at the onset of symptoms of the condition or within 48 hours of the onset preferably within 24 hours more preferably within 12 hours more preferably within 6 hours and even more preferably within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms of the condition.

An important embodiment of the invention is treatment of a subject with an abnormally elevated risk of an ischemic stroke. As used herein subjects having an abnormally elevated risk of an ischemic stroke is a category determined according to conventional medical practice such subjects may also be identified in conventional medical practice as having known risk factors for stroke or having increased risk of cerebrovascular events. Subjects having an abnormally elevated risk of an ischemic stroke includes for example individuals undergoing surgical or diagnostic procedures which risk release of emboli lowering of blood pressure or decrease in blood flow to the brain such as carotid endarterectomy brain angiography neurosurgical procedures in which blood vessels are compressed or occluded cardiac catheterization angioplasty including balloon angioplasty coronary by pass surgery or similar procedures.

Also the higher doses enabled by the present invention are expected to be of particular importance for dementias including Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease and vascular dementia pain syndromes including headaches and migraines seizure disorders movement disorders and brain trauma.

Furthermore the ease of use and convenience of a dosage form provided developed to be delivered at once per day or less frequent administration at a therapeutically effective quantity from the onset of therapy is of value in the treatment of dementias including Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease seizure disorders pain syndromes and cerebrovascular conditions.

The pharmaceutical compositions may be optimized for particular types of delivery. For example pharmaceutical compositions for oral delivery are formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are well known in the art. The carriers enable the agents in the composition to be formulated for example as a tablet pill capsule solution suspension sustained release formulation powder liquid or gel for oral ingestion by the subject.

The GCR antagonist may also be delivered in an aerosol spray preparation from a pressurized pack a nebulizer or from a dry powder inhaler. Suitable propellants that can be used in a nebulizer include for example dichlorodifluoro methane trichlorofluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethane and carbon dioxide. The dosage can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a regulated amount of the compound in the case of a pressurized aerosol. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or organic solvents or mixtures thereof and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as set out above. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral intranasal or respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably sterile pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution suspension or powder compositions may be administered preferably orally or nasally from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.

The activities of GR agonists and their alteration of cellular functions are variable depending on complex intracellular molecular signaling that are cell and tissue specific. Amongst the cells that have glucocorticoid receptors are stem and progenitor cells of all tissues and organs of the body.

Thus binding of such molecules to normative in tissue stem cells and the progeny of these stem cells so called transit amplifying progenitor cells results in variable cell and tissue specific effects inhibitory or enhancing of stem and progenitor cell functions including activation proliferation migration and differentiation all of which are dependent on the tissue organ in question.

The term stem cell generally refers to a cell that on division faces two developmental options the daughter cells can be identical to the original cell self renewal or they may be the progenitors of more specialized cell types differentiation . The stem cell is therefore capable of adopting one or other pathway a further pathway exists in which one of each cell type can be formed . Stem cells are therefore cells which are not terminally differentiated and are able to produce cells of other types.

Embryonic Stem ESCs cells may be isolated from the inner cell mass ICM of the blastocyst which is the stage of embryonic development when implantation occurs. Pluripotent stem cells are true stem cells with the potential to make any differentiated cell in the body. However they cannot contribute to making the extraembryonic membranes which are derived from the trophoblast.

Multipotent stem cells are true stem cells but can only differentiate into a limited number of types. For example the bone marrow contains multipotent stem cells that give rise to all the cells of the blood but not to other types of cells. Multipotent stem cells are found in adult animals. It is thought that every organ in the body contains them where they can replace dead or damaged cells.

Methods of characterizing stem cells are known in the art and include the use of standard assay methods such as clonal assay flow cytometry long term culture and molecular biological techniques e.g. PCR RT PCR and Southern blotting.

Adult stem cells comprise a wide variety of types including neuronal skin and the blood forming stem cells which are the active component in bone marrow transplantation. These latter stem cell types are also the principal feature of umbilical cord derived stem cells. Adult stem cells can mature both in the laboratory and in the body into functional more specialised cell types although the exact number of cell types is limited by the type of stem cell chosen.

Induced pluripotent stem cells commonly abbreviated as iPS cells or iPSCs are a type of pluripotent stem cell artificially derived from a non pluripotent cell typically an adult somatic cell by inserting certain genes. iPS cells are reviewed and discussed in Takahashi K. Yamanaka 2006 Yamanaka S et. al. 2007 Wemig M et. al. 2007 Maherali N et. al. 2007 Yu J et al. 2007 and Takahashi et al. 2007 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

iPS cells are typically derived by transfection of certain stem cell associated genes into non pluripotent cells such as adult fibroblasts. Transfection is typically achieved through viral vectors for example through retroviral reprogramming. Transfected genes include the master transcriptional regulators Oct 3 4 Pouf51 and Sox2 although it is suggested that other genes enhance the efficiency of induction. After 3 4 weeks small numbers of transfected cells begin to become morphologically and biochemically similar to pluripotent stem cells and are typically isolated through morphological selection doubling time or through a reporter gene and antibiotic infection.

IPSCs may be induced from somatic cells such as fibroblasts by transfection with one or more transcription factors. In some cases cells are transformed with Oct3 4 Sox2 c Myc and Klf4. The cells may be additionally transfected with other genes including transcription factors and or marker genes. The genes may be introduced using a transposon system such as the Cre IoxP recombination system or using non integrating vectors in order to produce iPSCs free of exogenous reprogramming genes. Transfection may be achieved using viral vectors such as a retrovirus. The virus may be an amphotropic virus. Once the cells have been transfected they may be grown on feeder cells before transfer to an ESC culture medium.

iPS cells may be derived from any suitable cell type including lung foreskin fibroblasts skin fibroblasts keratinocytes blood progenitor cells bone marrow cells hepatocytes gastric epithelial cells pancreatic cells neural stem cells B lymphocytes ES derived somatic cells and embryonic fibroblasts. In some cases the cells are not human dermal fibroblasts. The IPSCs may exhibit similar patterns of gene expression and phenotype to ESCs.

Several methods have now been provided for the isolation of pluripotent stem cells that do not lead to the destruction of an embryo e.g. by transforming inducing adult somatic cells or germ cells. These methods include 

1. Reprogramming by nuclear transfer. This technique involves the transfer of a nucleus from a somatic cell into an oocyte or zygote. In some situations this may lead to the creation of an animal human hybrid cell. For example cells may be created by the fusion of a human somatic cell with an animal oocyte or zygote or fusion of a human oocyte or zygote with an animal somatic cell. 2. Reprogramming by fusion with embryonic stem cells. This technique involves the fusion of a somatic cell with an embryonic stem cell. This technique may also lead to the creation of animal human hybrid cells as in 1 above. 3. Spontaneous re programming by culture.

This technique involves the generation of pluripotent cells from non pluripotent cells after long term culture. For example pluripotent embryonic germ EG cells have been generated by long term culture of primordial germ cells PGC Matsui et al. Derivation of pluripotential embryonic stem cells from murine primordial germ cells in culture. Cell 70 841 847 1992 incorporated herein by reference . The development of pluripotent stem cells after prolonged culture of bone marrow derived cells has also been reported Jiang et al. Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow. Nature 418 41 49 2002 incorporated herein by reference . They designated these cells multipotent adult progenitor cells MAPCs . Shinohara et al also demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells can be generated during the course of culture of germline stem GS cells from neonate mouse testes which they designated multipotent germline stem mGS cells Kanatsu Shinohara et al. 

Generation of pluripotent stem cells from neonatal mouse testis. Cell 119 1001 1012 2004 . 4. Reprogramming by defined factors. For example the generation of iPS cells by the retrovirus mediated introduction of transcription factors such as Oct 3 4 Sox2 c Myc and KLF4 into mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts e.g. as described above. Kaji et al Virus free induction of pluripotency and subsequent excision of reprogramming factors. Nature. Online publication 1 Mar. 2009 also describe the non viral transfection of a single multiprotein expression vector which comprises the coding sequences of c Myc Klf4 Oct4 and Sox2 linked with 2A peptides that can reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts. iPS cells produced with this non viral vector show robust expression of pluripotency markers indicating a reprogrammed state confirmed functionally by in vitro differentiation assays and formation of adult chimaeric mice. They succeeded in establishing reprogrammed human cell lines from embryonic fibroblasts with robust expression of pluripotency markers.

This technique involves chemical or electrical stimulation of an unfertilised egg so as to cause it to develop into a blastomere from which embryonic stem cells may be derived. For example see Lin et al. Multilineage potential of homozygous stem cells derived from metaphase II oocytes. Stem Cells. 2003 21 2 152 61 who employed the chemical activation of nonfertilized metaphase II oocytes to produce stem cells. 8. Stem cells of fetal origin. These cells lie between embryonic and adult stem cells in terms of potentiality and may be used to derive pluripotent or multipotent cells.

Cimbilical cord is a tissue that is normally discarded and stem cells derived from this tissue have tended not to attract moral or ethical objection.

Induced pluripotent stem cells have the advantage that they can be obtained by a method that does not cause the destruction of an embryo more particularly by a method that does not cause the destruction of a human or mammalian embryo. As such aspects of the invention may be performed or put into practice by using cells that have not been prepared exclusively by a method which necessarily involves the destruction of human or animal embryos from which those cells may be derived. This optional limitation is specifically intended to take account of Decision G0002 06 of 25 Nov. 2008 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office.

Mesenchymal stem cells are known as being multipotent and exhibit the potential for differentiation into different cells tissue lineages including cartilage bone adipose tissue tendon and ligament. These multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells are denoted as stromal or mesenchymal stem cells. Bone marrow contains two main cell types hematopoietic cells and stromal cells. The stem cells for non hematopoietic tissues are referred as mesenchymal cells because of their ability to differentiate as mesenchymal or stromal cells.

Accordingly in this specification mesenchymal stem cells MSCs refers to multipotent stem cells capable of differentiation into osteoblasts chondrocytes myocytes adipocytes and endothelium. In this specification MSCs particularly refers to multipotent stem cells capable of differentiation into osteoblasts as part of the process of formation of bone.

Mesenchymal cells are easily obtainable from bone marrow by minimally invasive techniques and can be expanded in culture and permitted to differentiate into the desired lineage. Differentiation can be induced by the application of specific growth factors. The transforming growth factor beta TGF beta superfamily member proteins such as the bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are important factors of chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.

Suitable MSCs may be obtained or derived from bone marrow mononuclear cells BMMNCs collected from aspirates of bone marrow e.g. Wexler et al. Adult bone marrow is a rich source of human mesenchymal stem cells but umbilical cord and mobilized adult blood are not. HAEMOPOIESIS AND LEUCOCYTES British Journal of Haematology 121 2 368 374 April 2003. or Wharton s Jelly of the umbilical cord e.g. Ta et al.

Cells are then maintained for up to 28 days with a media change every 3 4 days. After 14 days cells in the chamber slides may be fixed in 4 PFA and stored at 4.degree. C. in PBS for immunohistochemistry. After 14 and 28 days the cells are stained with alizarin red S for calcium and von Kossa for calcium phosphate. RNA may also be extracted for analysis using the Nucleospin RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer s instructions Macherey Nagel and protein samples may be extracted for analysis.

Differentiation of MSCs to the adipogenic lineage may be achieved by culture in adipogenic medium. For example MSCs are seeded at 18 000 cm.sup.2 in maintenance medium and incubated as above for 2 days.

Media is removed and cells are washed once in PBS before the addition of adipogenic maintenance media DMEM 4.5 g l glucose 10 FCS L glutamine and penicillin and streptomycin or adipogenic media adipogenic maintenance media with 10 .mu.g ml insulin 115 microg ml methyl isobutylxanthine 1 .mu.M dexamethasone and 20 .mu.M indomethazine .

After two days the tubes will contain loose round pellets. Pellets are maintained for 21 days with a media change every 3 4 days before RNA is isolated using Trizol Invitrogen or cell pellets are fixed in 4 PFA and embedded for cryosectioning Serial sections are made before slides are stored at 80 C. for immunohistochemistry.

When osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation are investigated under confluent conditions cells may be seeded at 30 000 cmand allowed to reach confluence before switching to the relevant differentiation media and cultured as above.

Any suitable method of culturing stem cells may be used and any suitable container may be used to propagate stem cells. Suitable containers include those described in US Patent Publication US2007 0264713 Terstegge .

Containers may include bioreactors and spinners for example. A bioreactor is a container suitable for the cultivation of eukaryotic cells for example animal cells or mammalian cells such as in a large scale. A typical cultivation volume of a regulated bioreactor is between 20 ml and 500 ml.

The bioreactor may comprise a regulated bioreactor in which one or more conditions may be controlled or monitored for example oxygen partial pressure. Devices for measuring and regulating these conditions are known in the art. For example oxygen electrodes may be used for oxygen partial pressure. The oxygen partial pressure can be regulated via the amount and the composition of the selected gas mixture e.g. air or a mixture of air and or oxygen and or nitrogen and or carbon dioxide . Suitable devices for measuring and regulating the oxygen partial pressure are described by Bailey J E. Bailey J E. Biochemical Engineering Fundamentals second edition McGraw Hill Inc. ISBN 0 07 003212 2 Higher Education 1986 or Jackson A T. Jackson A T. Verfahrenstechnik in der Biotechnologie Springer ISBN 3540561900 1993 .

Other suitable containers include spinners. Spinners are regulated or unregulated bioreactors which can be agitated using various agitator mechanisms such as glass ball agitators impeller agitators and other suitable agitators. The cultivation volume of a spinner is typically between 20 ml and 500 ml. Roller bottles are round cell culture flasks made of plastic or glass having a culture area of between 400 and 2000 cm. sup.2. The cells are cultivated along the entire inner surface of these flasks the cells are coated with culture medium accomplished by a rolling motion i.e. rotating the bottles about their own individual axis.

Alternatively culture may be static i.e. where active agitation of the culture culture media is not employed. By reducing agitation of the culture aggregates of cells may be allowed to form. Whilst some agitation may be employed to encourage distribution and flow of the culture media over the cultured cells this may be applied so as not to substantially disrupt aggregate formation. For example a low rpm agitation e.g. less than 30 rpm or less than 20 rpm may be employed.

Propagation with Passage. Methods of cell culture may comprise passaging or splitting during culture. The methods may involve continuous or continual passage. Cells in culture may be dissociated from the substrate or flask and split subcultured or passaged by dilution into tissue culture medium and replating re culturing. The term passage may generally refer to the process of taking an aliquot of a cell culture dissociating the cells completely or partially diluting and inoculating into medium. The passaging may be repeated one or more times. The aliquot may comprise the whole or a portion of the cell culture. The cells of the aliquot may be completely partially or not confluent. The passaging may comprise at least some of the following sequence of steps aspiration rinsing trypsinization incubation dislodging quenching re seeding and aliquoting. The protocol published by the Hedrick Lab UC San Diego may be used.

The cells may be dissociated by any suitable means such as mechanical or enzymatic means known in the art. The cells may be broken up by mechanical dissociation for example using a cell scraper or pipette. The cells may be dissociated by sieving through a suitable sieve size such as through 100 micron or 500 micron sieves. The cells may be split by enzymatic dissociation for example by treatment with collagenase or trypLE harvested. The dissociation may be complete or partial. The dilution may be of any suitable dilution. The cells in the cell culture may be split at any suitable ratio. For example the cells may be split at a ratio of 1 2 or more 1 3 or more 1 4 or more or 1 5 or more. Thus stem cells may be passaged for 1 passage or more. For example stem cells may be passaged for 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 passages or more. Passages may be expressed as generations of cell growth. Stem cells may be propagated for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 generations or more. Stem cells may be propagated for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 cell doublings or more Co Culture and Feeders Methods may comprise culturing stem cells in the presence or absence of co culture. The term co culture refers to a mixture of two or more different kinds of cells that are grown together. The two or more different kinds of cells may be grown on the same surfaces such as particles or cell container surfaces or on different surfaces. The different kinds of cells may be grown on different particles.

Feeder cells may mean cells which are used for or required for cultivation of cells of a different type. In the context of stem cell culture feeder cells have the function of securing the survival proliferation and maintenance of cell pluripotency or multipotency. Cell pluripotency multipotency may be ensured by directly co cultivating the feeder cells. For example the inner surface of the container such as a culture dish may be coated with a feeder cell layer. The feeder cells release nutrients into the culture medium. Alternatively or in addition the feeder cells may be cultured in a medium to condition it. The conditioned medium may be used to culture the stem cells. Thus arrangements in which feeder cells are absent or not required are also possible.

The invention provides the treatment of stem cells with GR antagonist to yield GR antagonist treated stem cells.

Glucocorticoids GCs are central to the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders. These steroids however profoundly impact the skeleton particularly when administered for prolonged periods. In fact high dose GC therapy is almost universally associated with bone loss causing one of the most crippling forms of osteoporosis. Despite the frequency and severity of GC induced osteoporosis its treatment is less than satisfactory suggesting that its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. The present invention provides a method and treatment for these disorders as well as the rapid site specific bone growth by a combination cortisol blockers i.e. The present invention relates to the use of a GCR antagonist such as for example ORG34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the prevention or treatment of and the optional use of bone marrow irrigation bone compatible cement and PTH therapy.

The present invention relates to the use of GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells for the prevention or treatment of stress induced osteoporosis and the rapid healing of bone related injuries

The present invention is concerned with the therapeutic use human and veterinary of GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells to treat bone fracture. GR antagonists and GR antagonist treated stem cells are reported here to augment wound healing in bone. GR antagonists stimulate bone regeneration following injury and contribute to improved wound healing in bone. GR antagonists and GR antagonist treated stem cells provide improvements in the speed of bone fracture repair enabling a reduction in the recovery time from injury.

Bone fracture is a medical condition. In this application fracture includes damage or injury to bone in which a bone is cracked broken or chipped. A break refers to discontinuity in the bone. A fracture may be caused by physical impact or mechanical stress or by medical conditions such as osteoporosis or osteoarthritis.

Orthopedic classification of fractures includes closed or open and simple or multi fragmentary fractures. In closed fractures the skin remains intact whilst in an open fracture the bone may be exposed through the wound site which brings a higher risk of infection. Simple fractures occur along a single line tending to divide the bone in two. Multi fragmentary fractures spilt the bone into multiple pieces.

Other fracture types include compression fracture compacted fracture spiral fracture complete and incomplete fractures transverse linear and oblique fractures and comminuted fractures. In most subjects bone healing fracture union occurs naturally and is initiated following injury. Bleeding normally leads to clotting and attraction of white blood cells and fibroblasts followed by production of collagen fibres. This is followed by bone matrix calcium hydroxyapatite deposition mineralisation transforming the collagen matrix into bone. Immature re generated bone is typically weaker than mature bone and over time the immature bone undergoes a process of remodelling to produce mature lamellar bone. The complete bone healing process takes considerable time typically many months.

Bones in which fractures occur and which may benefit from treatment using GR antagonists include all bone types particularly all mammalian bones including but not limited to long bones e.g. femur humerus phalanges short bones e.g. carpals tarsals flat bones e.g. cranium ribs scapula sternum pelvic girdle irregular bones e.g. vertebrae sesamoid bones e.g. patella .

Bone fracture also includes pathological porosity such as that exhibited by subjects with osteoporosis. GR antagonists and GR antagonist treated stem cells and pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments comprising GR antagonists and GR antagonist treated stem cells are provided for use in a method of treatment of bone fracture in a mammalian subject. Treatment may comprise wound healing in bone. The treatment may involve repair regeneration and growth of bone. GR antagonists and GR antagonist treated stem cells facilitate fracture repair by facilitating new bone growth. GR antagonists act to improve the speed of fracture repair enabling bone healing to occur faster leading to improved recovery time from injury.

Treatment may lead to improved bone strength. Treatment may also include treatment of osteoporosis or osteoarthritis. Administration of GR antagonists and GR antagonist treated stem cells may for example be to the tissue surrounding the fracture. This may include administration directly to bone tissue in which the fracture has occurred. Administration may be to connective tissue surrounding the bone or fracture or to vasculature e.g. blood vessels near to and supplying the bone. Administration may be directly to the site of injury and may be to a callus formed by initial healing of the wound.

Medicaments and pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be formulated for administration by a number of routes. GR antagonists and GR antagonist treated stem cells may be formulated in fluid or liquid form for injection or as part of a gel suitable for application to bone or other tissue surrounding the fracture.

Administration is preferably in a therapeutically effective amount this being sufficient to improve healing of the bone fracture compared to a corresponding untreated fracture or to a fracture treated with GR antagonist treated stem cells obtained from culture in control conditions. The actual amount administered and rate and time course of administration will depend on the nature and severity of the fracture. Prescription of treatment e.g. decisions on dosage etc is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors and will typically take account of the nature of the fracture the condition of the individual patient the site of delivery the method of administration and other factors known to practitioners. Single or multiple administrations of GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cell doses may be administered in accordance with the guidance of the prescribing medical practitioner. Examples of the techniques and protocols mentioned above can be found in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 20th Edition 2000 pub. Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells may be used to treat bone fracture alongside other treatments such as administration of pain relieving or anti inflammatory medicaments immobilisation and setting of the bone e.g. immobilising the injured limb in a plaster cast surgical intervention e.g. to re set a bone or move a bone to correct displacement angulation or dislocation. If surgery is required GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells may be administered directly to e.g. applied to the fracture during the surgical procedure. Pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments of the invention may take the form of a biomaterial that is coated and or impregnated with GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells. An implant or prosthesis may be formed from the biomaterial. Such implants or prostheses may be surgically implanted to assist in bone growth regeneration restructuring and or re modelling.

GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells may be applied to implants or prostheses to accelerate new bone formation at a desired location. The biomaterial may be coated or impregnated with GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells. Impregnation may comprise contacting the GR antagonists with the biomaterial such that they are allowed to be adsorbed and or absorbed onto and or into the biomaterial. Coating may comprise adsorbing the GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells onto the surface of the biomaterial. Coating or impregnation of the biomaterial may involve seeding GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells onto or into the biomaterial.

The biomaterial should allow the coated or impregnated GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells to be released from the biomaterial when administered to or implanted in the subject. Biomaterial release kinetics may be altered by altering the structure e.g. porosity of the biomaterial.

In addition to coating or impregnating a biomaterial with GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells one or more biologically active molecules may be impregnated or coated on the biomaterial. For example at least one chosen from the group consisting of BMP 2 BMP 4 OP 1 FGF 1 FGF 2 TGF beta1 TGF beta2 TGF beta3 VEGF collagen laminin fibronectin vitronectin. In addition or alternatively to the above bioactive molecules one or more bisphosphonates may be impregnated or coated onto the biomaterial along with GR antagonists. Examples of useful bisphosphonates may include at least one chosen from the group consisting of etidronate clodronate alendronate pamidronate risedronate zoledronate. Optionally GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells is excluded from being impregnated or coated on the biomaterial.

Biomaterials coated or impregnated with GR antagonists or GR antagonist treated stem cells may be useful in both medical and veterinary purposes. It will be appreciated that the present invention may improve the quality of life of a patient or potentially extend the life of an animal for example a valuable race horse for use in breeding.

The biomaterial provides a scaffold or matrix support. The biomaterial may be suitable for implantation in tissue or may be suitable for administration e.g. as microcapsules in solution . The implant or prosthesis should be biocompatible e.g. non toxic and of low immunogenicity most preferably non immunogenic . The biomaterial may be biodegradable such that the biomaterial degrades as wound healing occurs ultimately leaving only the regenerated bone in situ in the subject. Alternatively a non biodegradable biomaterial may be used e.g. to guide bone regeneration over a large discontinuity and or to act as a structural support during bone healing with surgical removal of the biomaterial being an optional requirement after successful wound healing.

Biomaterials may be soft and or flexible e.g. hydrogels fibrin web or mesh or collagen sponges. A hydrogel is a substance formed when an organic polymer which can be natural or synthetic is set or solidified to create a three dimensional open lattice structure that entraps molecules of water or other solutions to form a gel. Solidification can occur by aggregation coagulation hydrophobic interactions or cross linking.

Alternatively biomaterials may be relatively rigid structures e.g. formed from solid materials such as plastics or biologically inert metals such as titanium. The biomaterial may have a porous matrix structure which may be provided by a crosslinked polymer. The matrix is preferably permeable to nutrients and growth factors required for bone growth.

Matrix structures may be formed by crosslinking fibres e.g. fibrin or collagen or of liquid films of sodium alginate chitosan or other polysaccharides with suitable crosslinkers e.g. calcium salts polyacrylic acid heparin. Alternatively scaffolds may be formed as a gel fabricated by collagen or alginates crosslinked using well established methods known to those skilled in the art.

Suitable polymer materials for matrix formation include but are not limited by biodegradable bioresorbable polymers which may be chosen from the group of agarose collagen fibrin chitosan polycaprolactone poly DL lactide co caprolactone poly L lactide co caprolactone co glycolide polyglycolide polylactide polyhydroxyalcanoates co polymers thereof or non biodegradable polymers which may be chosen from the group of cellulose acetate cellulose butyrate alginate polysulfone polyurethane polyacrylonitrile sulfonated polysulfone polyamide polyacrylonitrile polymethylmethacrylate co polymers thereof.

A further example of a biomaterial is a polymer that incorporates hydroxyapatite or hyaluronic acid.

The biomaterial can be supplemented with additional cells. For example one can seed the biomaterial or cosynthesise it with fibroblast derived feeder cells which may be useful for supporting growth and maintenance of the GR antagonists.

While elevated cortisol plays important roles in physiologic homeostasis in the face of extreme physical and emotional stress it can have negative effects on wound healing by inhibiting cells important to wound repair including stem cells through binding to their glucocorticoid receptors GR .

Application of a GR antagonist or active agent such as ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can improve wound healing in such circumstances. However blockade of systemic cortisol binding to GR must be avoided. Thus the present inventions provides for the local application of PT155 PT156 or PT157 to wounds by topical application in cutaneous wounds or by direct injection or local vascular infusion will help in wound repair in the face of acute physical trauma e.g. war wounds while at the same time preserving the systemic homeostasis to which cortisol contributes.

Application of the same to stem cell therapies is also provided by pre treatment of transplantable stem cells with ORG 34517 PT150 PT155 PT156 PT157 PT158 TCY1 combinations thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In addition the invention provides for pre treatment of an implantable organ prior to implantation in the recipient. The invention provides for treatment of an implantable organ during implantation in the recipient.

A perfusion system for cells may be used to expose a tissue or organ to a GR antagonist in the form of a liquid or a semi solid. Perfusion refers to continuous flow of a solution through or over a population of cells. It implies the retention of the cells within the culture unit as opposed to continuous flow culture which washes the cells out with the withdrawn media e.g. chemostat . Perfusion allows for better control of the culture environment pH pO.sub.2 nutrient levels GR antagonist levels etc. and is a means of significantly increasing the utilization of the surface area within a culture for cell attachment.

The technique of perfusion was developed to mimic the cells milieu in vivo where cells are continuously supplied with blood lymph or other body fluids. Without perfusion of a physiological nutrient solution cells in culture go through alternating phases of being fed and starved thus limiting full expression of their growth and metabolic potential. In the context of the present invention a perfusion system may also be used to perfuse cells with an GR antagonist to induce stasis.

Those of skill in the art are familiar with perfusion systems and there are a number of perfusion systems available commercially. Any of these perfusion systems may be employed in the present invention. One example of a perfusion system is a perfused packed bed reactor using a bed matrix of a non woven fabric CelliGen New Brunswick Scientific Edison N.J. Wang et al. 1992 Wang et al. 1993 Wang et al. 1994 . Briefly described this reactor comprises an improved reactor for culturing of both anchorage and nonanchorage dependent cells. The reactor is designed as a packed bed with a means to provide internal recirculation. Preferably a fiber matrix carrier is placed in a basket within the reactor vessel. A top and bottom portion of the basket has holes allowing the medium to flow through the basket. A specially designed impeller provides recirculation of the medium through the space occupied by the fiber matrix for assuring a uniform supply of nutrient and the removal of wastes. This simultaneously assures that a negligible amount of the total cell mass is suspended in the medium. The combination of the basket and the recirculation also provides a bubble free flow of oxygenated medium through the fiber matrix. The fiber matrix is a non woven fabric having a pore diameter of from 10 micrometer to 100 micrometer providing for a high internal volume with pore volumes corresponding to 1 to 20 times the volumes of individual cells.

The perfused packed bed reactor offers several advantages. With a fiber matrix carrier the cells are protected against mechanical stress from agitation and foaming. The free medium flow through the basket provides the cells with optimum regulated levels of oxygen pH and nutrients. Products can be continuously removed from the culture and the harvested products are free of cells and can be produced in low protein medium which facilitates subsequent purification steps. This technology is explained in detail in WO 94 17178 Aug. 4 1994 Freedman et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The Cellcube Corning Costar module provides a large styrenic surface area for the immobilization and growth of substrate attached cells. It is an integrally encapsulated sterile single use device that has a series of parallel culture plates joined to create thin sealed laminar flow spaces between adjacent plates.

The Cellcube module has inlet and outlet ports that are diagonally opposite each other and help regulate the flow of media. During the first few days of growth the culture is generally satisfied by the media contained within the system after initial seeding. The amount of time between the initial seeding and the start of the media perfusion is dependent on the density of cells in the seeding inoculum and the cell growth rate. The measurement of nutrient concentration in the circulating media is a good indicator of the status of the culture. When establishing a procedure it may be necessary to monitor the nutrients composition at a variety of different perfusion rates to determine the most economical and productive operating parameters.

Other commercially available perfusion systems include for example CellPerf Laboratories MABIO International Tourcoing France and the Stovall Flow Cell Stovall Life Science Inc. Greensboro N.C. . The timing and parameters of the production phase of cultures depends on the type and use of a particular cell line. Many cultures require a different media for production than is required for the growth phase of the culture. The transition from one phase to the other will likely require multiple washing steps in traditional cultures. However one of the benefits of a perfusion system is the ability to provide a gentle transition between various operating phases. The perfusion system can also facilitate the transition from a growth phase to a static phase induced by an GR antagonist. Likewise the perfusion system can facilitate the transition from a static phase to a growth phase by replacing the solution comprising an GR antagonist with for example a physiological nutrient media.

The compounds of the invention may be administered enterally or parenterally. Mixed with pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries e.g. as described in the standard reference Gennaro et al. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences. The compounds may be compressed into solid dosage units such as pills tablets or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied in the form of a solution suspension emulsion e.g. for use as an injection preparation or eye drops or as a spray e.g. for use as a nasal spray.

For making dosage units e.g. tablets the use of conventional additives such as fillers colorants polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactose starch cellulose derivatives and the like or mixtures thereof used in suitable amounts.

The compositions of the present invention can be processed by agglomeration air suspension chilling air suspension drying balling coacervation coating comminution compression cryopelletization encapsulation extrusion wet granulation dry granulation homogenization inclusion complexation lyophilization melting microencapsulation mixing molding pan coating solvent dehydration sonication spheronization spray chilling spray congealing spray drying or other processes known in the art. The compositions can be provided in the form of a minicapsule a capsule a smart capsule a tablet an implant a troche a lozenge minitablet a temporary or permanent suspension an ovule a suppository a wafer a chewable tablet a quick or fast dissolving tablet an effervescent tablet a buccal or sublingual solid a granule a film a sprinkle a pellet a bead a pill a powder a triturate a platelet a strip or a sachet. Compositions can also be administered as a dry syrup where the finished dosage form is placed directly on the tongue and swallowed or followed with a drink or beverage.

These forms are well known in the art and are packaged appropriately. The compositions can be formulated for oral nasal buccal ocular urethral transmucosal vaginal topical or rectal delivery.

The pharmaceutical composition can be coated with one or more enteric coatings seal coatings film coatings barrier coatings compress coatings fast disintegrating coatings or enzyme degradable coatings. Multiple coatings can be applied for desired performance. Further the dosage form can be designed for immediate release pulsatile release controlled release extended release delayed release targeted release synchronized release or targeted delayed release. For release absorption control solid carriers can be made of various component types and levels or thicknesses of coats with or without an active ingredient. Such diverse solid carriers can be blended in a dosage form to achieve a desired performance. The definitions of these terms are known to those skilled in the art. In addition the dosage form release profile can be affected by a polymeric matrix composition a coated matrix composition a multiparticulate composition a coated multiparticulate composition an ion exchange resin based composition an osmosis based composition or a biodegradable polymeric composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the release may be effected through favorable diffusion dissolution erosion ion exchange osmosis or combinations thereof.

When formulated as a capsule the capsule can be a hard or soft gelatin capsule a starch capsule or a cellulosic capsule. Although not limited to capsules such dosage forms can further be coated with for example a seal coating an enteric coating an extended release coating or a targeted delayed release coating. These various coatings are known in the art but for clarity the following brief descriptions are provided seal coating or coating with isolation layers Thin layers of up to 20 microns in thickness can be applied for variety of reasons including for particle porosity reduction to reduce dust for chemical protection to mask taste to reduce odor to minimize gastrointestinal irritation etc. The isolating effect is proportional to the thickness of the coating. Water soluble cellulose ethers are preferred for this application. HPMC and ethyl cellulose in combination or Eudragit E100 may be particularly suitable for taste masking applications. Traditional enteric coating materials listed elsewhere can also be applied to form an isolating layer.

Extended release coatings are designed to effect delivery over an extended period of time. The extended release coating is a pH independent coating formed of for example ethyl cellulose hydroxypropyl cellulose methylcellulose hydroxymethyl cellulose hydroxyethyl cellulose acrylic esters or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. Various extended release dosage forms can be readily designed by one skilled in art to achieve delivery to both the small and large intestines to only the small intestine or to only the large intestine depending upon the choice of coating materials and or coating thickness.

Enteric coatings are mixtures of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are applied to combined with mixed with or otherwise added to the carrier or composition. The coating may be applied to a compressed or molded or extruded tablet a gelatin capsule and or pellets beads granules or particles of the carrier or composition. The coating may be applied through an aqueous dispersion or after dissolving in appropriate solvent. Additional additives and their levels and selection of a primary coating material or materials will depend on the following properties 1. resistance to dissolution and disintegration in the stomach 2. impermeability to gastric fluids and drug carrier enzyme while in the stomach 3. ability to dissolve or disintegrate rapidly at the target intestine site 4. physical and chemical stability during storage 5. non toxicity 6. easy application as a coating substrate friendly and 7. economical practicality.

Dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention can also be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms i.e. as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the lower gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet mold coated or uncoated containing granules pellets beads or particles of the active ingredient and or other composition components which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule coated or uncoated containing pellets beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition which are themselves coated or uncoated.

Delayed release generally refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the lower intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. The preferred method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5 but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating in the practice of the present invention to achieve delivery to the lower gastrointestinal tract. Polymers for use in the present invention are anionic carboxylic polymers.

Shellac also called purified lac a refined product obtained from the resinous secretion of an insect. This coating dissolves in media of pH 7.

Colorants detackifiers surfactants antifoaming agents lubricants stabilizers such as hydroxy propyl cellulose acid base may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material and to improve coating performance and the coated product.

In carrying out the method of the present invention the combination of the invention may be administered to mammalian species such as dogs cats humans etc. and as such may be incorporated in a conventional systemic dosage form such as a tablet capsule elixir or injectable. The above dosage forms will also include the necessary carrier material excipient lubricant buffer antibacterial bulking agent such as mannitol antioxidants ascorbic acid of sodium bisulfite or the like.
