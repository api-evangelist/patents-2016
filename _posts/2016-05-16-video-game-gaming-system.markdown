This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62 163 179 filed May 18 2015 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The majority 60 75 of U.S. casino revenue comes from slot machines however revenue from slot machines has been declining over the past decade. On the other hand there are 112 million multiplayer gamers in the U.S. today. Video games generate 26 billion per year rivaling a similar spend from fans of traditional sports. Casinos will benefit by offering new products that appeal to generations who ve grown up playing video games.

Casinos are undergoing a crisis as revenue from slot machines continues to fall. Casinos are struggling to engage and retain a young audience. Most slot players are older above 50 while young people below 40 don t play slots as they grew up playing interactive video games. Traditional slot machine manufacturers are not keeping up with younger players expectations for new games. Younger players who grew up playing video games spend much less time in casinos than the older players and are looking for a more engaging product beyond traditional reel slot machines.

The problem of retention of users of traditional gaming machines lies in that they are less interactive and are based on chance rather than skill as interactive video games tend to be. Current technologies fail to incorporate younger players interests in interactive games of skill with casino machines. In particular existing technologies fail to directly combine a player s performance in a game of skill with the payout.

Therefore there is a need to provide means to increase enjoyment and interactivity of gaming devices wherein player skill input has a clear and obvious effect on player payouts.

To increase enjoyment and interactivity of gaming devices among other things embodiments of the video game gaming machine VGM described herein may be played similarly to a traditional slot machine but with features allowing the player to have greater control over the outcome of the game while still providing desirable expected Return To Player eRTP values. In some embodiments the VGM combines the feel of a traditional arcade cabinet with a slot machine with a unique player experience that brings a new element of skill to the casino floor.

Embodiments of the invention described herein provide various solutions to reinvigorate slot revenue and bring the next generation and a new audience to the casino with video game gaming. For example one embodiment of the invention described herein is a VGM which facilitates gaming activities by employing popular video games on the casino floor. In some embodiments the VGM is a single player experience that replaces traditional reel slot machines. In further embodiments the VGM is a proprietary video game gaming machine which is configured to receive wagers from players betting against the house while competing in multiplayer video games. It is envisioned that the described VGM will ultimately increase revenues as compared with traditional slot machines and would be more attractive to both a younger audience uninterested in traditional slot machines and an older audience seeking something new to play. The VGM of the invention provides many advantages such as a dynamic game pace and engaging experience and includes eSports gaming and related features which is currently one of the fastest growing spectator sports. Some embodiments of the invention described herein provide players with games gaming methods and a gaming experience which is relatively easy to play yet also challenging to master. It is envisioned that the VGM of the invention would also have widespread appeal amongst gamers who love video games crossing over multiple popular game genres.

Some embodiments of the invention are directed to computer implemented methods computer implemented systems and non transitory computer readable storage media encoded with a computer program including instructions in code and data segments which are executable by a processor and upon execution thereof configured to provide a game of chance in the computerized environment which may include one or more data communication and display devices wherein the size and or nature of the payout within a game session can be influenced by the application of skill by one or more players.

In some embodiments differing levels of skill exhibited during game play yield different eRTP expected Return To Player without any payback compensation. In such embodiments the game system design parameters may be adjusted by the processor to affect the level of skill required for any given player to avoid any particular level of payback loss.

In some other embodiments the present invention is able to generate an aRTP actual Return To Player to be within a specific range of values over a specific number of games to within a specific confidence level by employing the means to a select or construct a Playfield for a given game session whose Maximum Available Payout based on the application of Optimal Skill is less than the maximum possible payout listed in the corresponding Paytable b increase payout during a game session based upon detection of the use of Sub Optimal Skill.

In some embodiments the payout is based on a Key Score with respect to a Paytable which defines specific payout for specific Key Score values. In some embodiments no payout is awarded unless a certain minimum Key Score was attained. A Key Score whose value is large enough to warrant a payout is called a Qualifying Key Score. In some embodiments there is a different payout for each different Qualifying Key Score. In some embodiments at least two Qualifying Key Scores results in the same payout. In some embodiments where the Key Score is larger than required to otherwise qualify for a payout only the highest payout is awarded. For example in the case of a game where the final result is 4 ducks and whose Paytable is comprised of the prizes a 5 prize for 5 ducks b 2 prize for 4 ducks and c 1 prize for 3 ducks only the 2 prize will be awarded even though 3 ducks is a subset of a 4 ducks result.

Unless otherwise defined all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used in this specification and the appended Claims the singular forms a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Any reference to or herein is intended to encompass and or unless otherwise stated.

The term game session refers to the totality of time from the acceptance of a player wager and corresponding start of play until the end of all play such that a new wager can be accepted.

The term play session refers to the totality of time from insertion or activation of funds until the player leaves the game. A play session usually includes one or more game sessions.

The term payout refers to type of award paid for a winning outcome. Such prizes are often a specific multiple of part or all of the wagers placed on the game though additional types of prizes shall be presented later in the present disclosure.

The term Return To Player often referred to in the gaming industry and corresponding regulatory agencies by the acronym RTP means the mathematically expected long term player payback percentage of a gaming proposition. However for the purposes of the present disclosure there is a need to differentiate between this traditional interpretation of RTP and actual RTP based on a fixed number of actual wagers and payouts. Thus each of the two specific varieties of RTP are defined with their own unique terms.

The term expected Return To Player or eRTP refers the traditional definition of RTP as a reflection of the mathematically expected long term player payback.

The term actual Return To Player or aRTP refers to the ratio of total actual payouts to total actual wagers over a given period of time or specific number of games for a specific math model implemented on a particular gaming machine or implemented by one or more gaming machines.

There are many forms of skill that can apply to games of chance. If not otherwise modified the term skill within the present disclosure refers to video game skill defined below.

The term video game skill refers to time sensitive inputs which can be sub categorized into twitch skill and manual skill. 

The term twitch skill or twitch game refers physical skill involving specific timing and or positioning and or movement control which requires a certain level of hand eye coordination.

The term manual skill refers to physical skill merely consisting of activating a device input said activation not requiring any special timing or dexterity e.g. pressing a button pressing a non moving area of a touch screen whose hotspot is significantly larger than the contact point of a finger or stylus clicking a mouse button trackball button or controller button when the corresponding cursor or pointer is positioned within a non moving area of the display whose hotspot is significantly larger than cursor or pointer. A well known example of manual skill in the gaming industry is the very rapid pressing of the SPIN button on a slot machine during a slots tournament.

The term pseudo skill refers to game mechanisms which falsely try to make it appear that twitch skill like input affects the final outcome when in fact the final outcome will be the same irrespective of such inputs.

The term strategic skill refers a knowledgeable choice made by the player to directly or indirectly improve their chance of winning and or increasing the amount of their winnings. Within the gaming industry games such as video poker blackjack and many varieties of poker require non trivial skill for a given player to optimize their expected payback. Similarly there are numerous video games wherein the player makes numerous strategic decisions either with or without time limits based on the game rules.

The term blind choice describes a mechanism by which the player makes a blind choice to reveal an outcome or payout. For example like selecting one of three covered boxes to see how many free spins are awarded in the subsequent free spins bonus round. Though some players may believe it is possible to obtain better than average results by spotting patterns within a sequence of truly random outcomes or having special psychic abilities there is no scientific evidence to support such beliefs.

The term Paytable refers to a summary listing of winning outcomes and their respective payout. In practice Paytables often include some of the game rules such as Malfunction voids all pays and play and Only highest winner paid. The term See Pays which is not otherwise used in this disclosure refers to all of the Paytables applicable to the given game plus all stated rules.

The term video game skill refers to time sensitive inputs which can be sub categorized into twitch skill and manual skill. 

The term VGM or Video Game Gaming Machine is a gaming device similar to a slot machine which allows players to place wagers and have control over the outcome of such wagers via skillful input by the player during game play.

More specifically a VGM is a computer implemented system or a non transitory computer readable storage media encoded with a computer program including instructions executable by a processor which is an embodiment of the present invention.

The term Playfield refers to all of the game elements and game parameters which can affect the play and or pay characteristics of the game session in which it is instantiated. The Playfield for a given game session is usually selected randomly at the start of each game session.

The term Playfield Selection Pool refers to a plurality of available Playfields from which the specific Playfield for a given game session is to be selected.

The term Key Score refers to the tally or metric or any other suitable result from playing some embodiments of the present invention and which is used for the determination of payouts if any. For example the number of targets downed in a shooting game is a Key Score if the Paytable is defined so at to award prizes based on total number of targets downed.

The term Secondary Score refers to any other type of tally or metric or any other result from playing some embodiments of the present invention which is not directly used for the determination of payouts. For example the number of consecutive hits on target without a miss.

The term Maximum Attainable Key Score refers to highest Key Score that can be achieved from the skillful play of a given Playfield.

The term Maximum Available Payout refers to highest payout associated with the Maximum Attainable Key Score. Each Playfield is constructed in such a way as to have a Maximum Attainable Key Score and corresponding Maximum Available Payout.

The term Payout Level refers to a specific Maximum Available Payout and or all Playfields with said Maximum Available Payout.

The term Optimal Skill refers to the application of video game skill defined earlier sufficient to earn the Maximum Available Payout within a given Playfield. Optimal Skill does not necessarily mean perfect skill or best possible skill. For example in a game whose Paytable defines a winning outcome as being within a range of Key Scores such as 5 or 6 downed targets pays 2 or 10 or more downed targets pays 20 any applied video game skill which attains the lowest Key Score required for a given Maximum Available Payout is deemed optimal skill even if the application of a greater level of skill could attain a higher Key Score for the same payout within a given Playfield.

The term Sub Optimal Skill refers to the application of video game skill which is unable to earn the Maximum Available Payout.

In some embodiments aRTP actual Return To Player is managed by forcing a specific value to be awarded for a given a variable size bonus award. In some embodiments aRTP actual Return To Player is managed by adjusting frequency with which bonus events are triggered. In some embodiments aRTP actual Return To Player is managed by awarding the player extra time in order to achieve the maximum possible Key Score if current progress within the game session implies that the player will not achieve said maximum possible Key Score otherwise. In some embodiments aRTP actual Return To Player is managed by awarding all players extra time in Playfields with larger payouts to better assure that most players will be able to earn the entirety of the maximum possible award for said Playfield.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a table is provided to provide a 75 eRTP based on a game Paytable for a race game. In some embodiments eRTP expected Return To Player is calculated as the sum of the multiplication of the payout of each Payout Level and the chance of selecting a Playfield from said Payout Level.

In some embodiments the methods systems and media described herein include a Maximum Attainable Key Score or use of the same. In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score represents the best possible game performance a player with the best skill and dexterity achieves given the assigned Playfield. In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score is associated with a maximum payout. In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score is associated with a non maximum payout. In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score is associated with no payout. In some embodiments eRTP expected Return To Player is calculated based on the Maximum Attainable Key Score.

In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score is computed through software simulator to find the best theoretical and mathematical game performance. Referring to in a particular embodiment a table of basic elements of a track in a race game is provided including start finish straight left corner and right corner wherein each segment of a track can be converted into spots or cells whereby each cell takes one 1 millisecond to traverse.

In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score is computed through mathematical calculations using algorithms such as A Search Algorithm or Dijkstra s Algorithm or similar methods for finding the shortest or optimum path between nodes in a graph which may represent a track in a race game or path on the field in a sports game.

In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score is enforced through game design and implementation to ensure the player achieves the Maximum Available Payout. In some embodiments a Maximum Attainable Key Score is enforced through game design and implementation to ensure the player achieves the minimum payout. Referring to in a particular embodiment a table of basic elements in a first person action game is provided including Normal Enemies and Invincible Enemies whereby Normal Enemies may be eliminated by the player in normal gameplay and Invincible Enemies may not be eliminated by the player in normal gameplay. By controlling the weighted distribution of Normal and Invincible Enemies the game is able to ensure a specific aRTP actual Return To Player . Also referring to tables of basic elements plus different Chicken Dinner payouts relative to different respective bet sizes such as 1 Chicken for 2 Chicken for 3 Chicken for 5 Chicken for 25 Chicken for .

The present invention includes the means to select or construct a Playfield for a given game session whose maximum possible Key Score based on the application of Optimal Skill cannot exceed a specific value. A Key Score which represents the highest possible Key Score for a given Playfield is called a Maximum Attainable Key Score. In some embodiments all Maximum Attainable Key Scores are Qualifying Key Scores. In some embodiments at least one Maximum Attainable Key Score is not a Qualifying Key Score.

Embodiments in which at least one payout on the Paytable awards a prize larger than the product of eRTP and the corresponding wager which is true with every known casino gaming machine require at least one Playfield whose Maximum Attainable Key Score does not qualify for that payout.

Let s consider a simple example wherein the player controls a virtual golfer at a virtual driving range. This is a 3 button push game. The first button push starts the game causing the virtual golfer begin its back swing. The second button press is to optimally occur when the virtual golfer is at the perfect top of their swing for furthest distance. Making the second press before this point or after this point or not at all will adversely affect the power of the swing. The third button press is to optimally occur is the instant the virtual club touches the virtual ball at the fastest part of the swing. As with the second button press making a third button press too early or too late or not at all will adversely affect the power of the swing.

The Key Score in this sample game is the distance the virtual golf ball travels. If the virtual ball travels 220 virtual yards the player wins twice their wager. If the virtual ball travels between 200 and 219 virtual yards the player wins 0.75 of their wager. If the virtual ball travels less than 200 virtual yards the player wins half of their wager. The game is comprised of three different Playfields Field 1 has a 10 mph tail win which will results in the virtual golf ball travelling over 220 virtual yards if the second and third button presses each occur within 10 microseconds of perfect timing Field 2 has a 5 mph head wind win which will results in the virtual golf ball travelling at least 200 virtual yards if the second and third button presses each occur within 10 microseconds of perfect timing but will not result in the virtual golf ball travelling at 220 or more virtual yards if the second and third button presses each occur exactly at the point of perfect timing Field 3 has a 20 mph head win result in the virtual golf ball travelling less than 200 virtual yards even if the second and third button presses each occur exactly at the point of perfect timing.

When the player activates a game session with a first button press the VGM video game gaming machine randomly selects one of the three Playfields via a weighted table where Field 1 has a weight of 20 Field 2 has a weight of 40 and Field 3 has a weight of 40 which is indexed by a random integer uniformly selected from to inclusively. Therefore Field 1 has a 20 chance of being selected Field 2 has a 40 chance of being selected and Field 3 has a 40 chance of being selected.

The eRTP expected Return To Player of this sample game for Optimal Skill play can be calculated as the sum of the eRTP of each payout which is in turn calculated as the payout value times the probability of occurrence of that payout.

Therefore for optimal play eRTP game award1 probability1 award2 probability2 award3 probability3 2.0 20 0.75 40 0.50 40 90.0 Sub Optimal Skill Play Detection

Sub Optimal Skill is the application of skill which does not and cannot achieve the Maximum Attainable Key Score for the given Playfield typically caused by player error or significantly less than perfect player input.

In some embodiments of the present invention Sub Optimal Skill is determined via an aRTP calculation based on all prior completed play on a given machine or on a group of equivalent machines. In some embodiments Sub Optimal Skill is determined via an aRTP calculation based on no more than the last N prior completed play on a given machine or on a group of equivalent machines. In some embodiments Sub Optimal Skill is determined via an aRTP calculation based on prior completed play within the current play session. In some embodiments Sub Optimal Skill is determined via an aRTP calculation based on prior completed play of all players. In some embodiments Sub Optimal Skill is determined via an aRTP calculation based on prior completed play of the current player. In some embodiments unawarded potential payouts are tracked.

In some embodiments Sub Optimal Skill is determined by current Key Score at a particular time within a game session. In some embodiments Sub Optimal Skill is determined by considering overall game progress. For example in a shooting game whose targets require multiple hits to down a progress measurement would include both downed targets and not yet downed targets hit. In some embodiments Sub Optimal Skill is determined by considering one or more metrics at a particular time within a game session where none of said metrics is the Key Score.

For regulatory and or for business reasons there is a need to restrict the long term impact of Sub Optimal Skill on aRTP. In some embodiments of the present invention sub optimal play increases the likelihood of and or value from additional payout sources.

Is some embodiments at least one award provides a variable payout. The value of said variable payout is randomly selected by a secondary determination. The weights incorporated into the weighting tables used in the selection of an award value from an array of possible award values are modifiable based on the level of skill. The lower the skill the higher the weight values are skewed such that the average expected value correspondingly increases.

In some embodiments at least one special award is occasionally provided which is not based on a Key Score. In some embodiments at least one special award is occasionally provided which directly increases the Key Score. In some embodiments the probability of the awarding of a special award increases based on the lack of determined skilled.

In some embodiments said special award is redeemable by a given player with based on an input requiring minimal if any dexterity timing and or hand eye coordination. In some embodiments said special award is awarded to the player automatically without any inputs. In some embodiments if a said special award is redeemable by a given player with based on an input requiring minimal if any dexterity timing and or hand eye coordination but has not been redeemed within a specified amount of time said special award is awarded to the player automatically within any inputs. In some embodiments said special award is redeemable by a given player based on at least one input requiring some level of dexterity timing and or hand eye coordination wherein the amount of dexterity timing and or hand eye coordination required is greater as determined skill level increases. For example a game in which a player who is playing with Optimal Skill is provided a special award that is unlikely to be redeemed without affecting Key Score and a player is playing with low skill is provided an award that is unlikely not to be redeemed.

Returning to the previous golf simulation game example if the Playfield randomly selected for a given player has a Maximum Attainable Key Score say in excess of 220 virtual yards which awards a first payout 2 the wager but said player s skill in insufficient to achieve that skill then an alternate payout source is provided relative to said player s actual Key Score. For example if said player s virtual golf ball travels at least 180 virtual yards and is thusly eligible for an award 0.75 the wager then a special award of actual or average value of 1.25 the wager provides the same expected payout as for high skill players. The special award appears as a virtual gopher appears on the virtual landing zone the striking of which awards a prize whose average payout is 1.25 the wager. Had said player played at a high enough level of skill to have achieved the max possible award for said selected environment the displayed result shows the virtual golf ball in flight travelling over said virtual gopher. If said player s virtual golf ball travels at least 120 virtual yards but not more than 180 virtual yards and is thusly eligible for an award of 0.50 the wager then a special award of actual or average value of 1.50 the wager provides the same expected payout as for high skill players. If said player s virtual golf ball travels less than 120 virtual yards a different award redemption experience is provided to the player for thematic consistency. Specifically a result in which the virtual ball travels less than 120 virtual yards is designated as a non qualifying drive and a virtual golf shop is displayed to the player wherein the player is instructed to make at least one blind pick. The average expected value from a given virtual golf shop picking round is comparable or equal to the Maximum Available Payout value associated with the given Playfield.

In some embodiments the average expected value of a variable sized award is used to offset any prior under payments. In some embodiments the actual value awarded from a variable sized award is used to offset any prior under payments. In some variation both payment surpluses and deficits are considered. In some other variation if a given gaming systems pays out more than the current payout deficit the deficit is merely zeroed.

A video game gaming machine VGM provides players the flexibility of playing gaming on any popular video games such as a racing game a fighting game a first person shooter FPS game or a massively multiplayer online role playing game MMORPG . In one example a player is playing a race game on a video game gaming machine wherein his payout outcome depends on his best track time.

In this race game the player is racing on a track to achieve the best time. The player is able to restart at the beginning of the track at any time and has 60 seconds to post the best time. The player receives a payout based on their best time. It is a multiplayer racing game in which each player is represented as a ghost to other racers. Players are not able to influence other racers i.e. knock into other cars. This single player game in a multiplayer environment is a critical aspect of the competition and enjoyment in Race Game.

For such a race game for example a general rule is that a player has 60.0 seconds to post their optimum track time. The player may make multiple attempts for optimum track time in allowed 60.0 seconds and the race game stops immediately once the 60.0 seconds timer has expired. In addition any laps in progress are forfeited. The player s car starts at the track s start line. On commencement the car moves forward at constant velocity. Then the player gets to control the car using video game controller. The player is able to move forward move forward left or forward right. Game play ends immediately after 60.0 seconds. Game also ends if player achieves optimum track time that gives him the Maximum Available Payout.

This race game uses a very simple fixed Paytable with different potential distributions of outcomes. Referring to in a particular embodiment this race game uses a very simple fixed Paytable with five 5 potential Payout Levels. Each payout is defined based on the minimum time the player must score to receive the corresponding award. For example a player achieves a payout of 3.0 based on wager of 1 credit when he finishes the track on or below 14.00 seconds. In turn he gets paid 2 credits when his best track time is between 14.01 and 14.05 seconds. He gets paid nothing if he finishes the track in more than 14.20 seconds or he doesn t finish the track within the set time 60.0 seconds in this case .

When a player plays this race game he is presented a race track randomly chosen from a huge pool of race maps and tracks. In addition the creation of tracks and choice of a track are done to reflect the optimum path length optimum track time and different needs of Return To Player payout percentage.

Each race takes places on a track created using a design filter and test methodology. Tracks are designed from a defined pool of elements or symbols. Each track is designed such that the optimum path length and finish time of each total assembly of track symbols is within the range for each track distribution. Track assemblies are algorithmically tested and filtered to remove tracks that do not exactly conform to the specified optimum path lengths. Track assemblies that pass the automated testing filtering will then be tested qualitatively by humans. Ultimately all included tracks will correspond to the five Payout Levels noted in the Paytable above.

Regardless of the track the Paytable will remain fixed. Although every map will be created so that the player feels as if they re able to achieve the top prize sometimes it is not possible for the player to achieve every outcome for any particular map. Importantly every track will be designed to afford the player the best possible chance of racing the optimum track time and receiving the top payout for that given track. The actual balance of track outcomes will be defined by the Return To Player for that particular game and driven by a random number generator.

Race Game utilizes an industry standard random number generator RNG to randomly choose the track for each race. In some embodiments a first random number is used to choose the Payout Level. This will determine the Maximum Available Payout for the given game session if the player is able to achieve the optimum finish time on the specific track. A second random number is used to choose the specific map from the group of maps with the designated Payout Level. Race Game contains a very large total number of tracks such that any player is highly unlikely to repeat the same track ever.

This race Game includes a fixed Paytable in an effort to provide a clear and concise goal for all players. Irrespective of the track in which a player is racing they will always be awarded the same prize for finishing within the same time distribution. As the eRTP expected Return To Player percentage must be based on optimum play it must be said that not every track will allow players to finish in the top prize distribution. In fact some tracks must ensure players finish outside of any prize distributions. These tracks are said to be unbeatable.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a table is provided to provide a 75 eRTP based on a game Paytable for a race game. For this race game Return To Player is calculated as the sum of the multiplication of the payout of each distribution line and the chance of the appearance of each distribution line.

Players will receive a Track Group Distribution 1 track 5 of the time. The optimum finish time for this distribution is 14.00 resulting in a payout of 3. Players may potentially receive the payout for distributions 1 2 3 4 or 5 depending on their actual results.

Players will receive a Track Group Distribution 2 track 10 of the time. The optimum finish time for this distribution is between 14.01 and 14.05 resulting in a payout of 2. Players may potentially receive the payout for distributions 2 3 4 or 5 depending on their actual results.

Players will receive a Track Group Distribution 3 track 25 of the time. The optimum finish time for this distribution is between 14.05 and 14.10 resulting in a payout of 1. Players may potentially receive the payout for distributions 3 4 or 5 depending on their actual results.

Players will receive a Track Group Distribution 4 track 30 of the time. The optimum finish time for this distribution is between 14.11 and 14.20 resulting in a payout of 0.5. Players may potentially receive the payout for distributions 4 or 5 only depending on their actual results.

Players will receive a Track Group Distribution 5 track 30 of the time. The optimum finish time for this distribution is above 14.20 resulting in a payout of 0. Players may only receive the payout for distribution 5 i.e. 25 of tracks will result in zero payout.

Furthermore referring to in particular embodiments tables with 75 85 90 eRTP are respectively provided by adjusting the appearing chances of track groups with different optimum finish time. Accordingly other eRTP is achieved using the equation with different combination of track groups and their appearing chances.

The math model in this race game includes a fixed Paytable providing a clear and concise goal for all players. Irrespective of the track in which a player is racing they are awarded the same prize for finishing within the same time distribution.

As the eRTP expected Return To Player percentage must be based on optimal play not every track allows players to achieve the Maximum Available Payout. Some tracks provide no opportunity for the player to earn any payout. These tracks are said to be unbeatable. Player perception and experience is managed across all track types. A player feels the top payout is achievable through optimal play. Using a combination of tracks of varying difficulty player skill and random bonuses the math model manages the game outcome and the optimal Return To Player.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a math model of a race game is described wherein a diagram displays a player s payout outcome based on his actual finish time while playing in different track groups of race games. This game design specifically the weightings for eRTP relies on the concept of optimum play. In short optimum play specifies that eRTP be calculated assuming the player performs optimally and therefore receives the Maximum Available Payout while playing each game.

In the case of this race game the requirement for optimum play means that eRTP must be calculated assuming a player achieves the optimum finish time for each track. For example if the player randomly receives a Track Group Distribution 1 track eRTP is calculated based on an optimum finish time 14.00 and a payout of 3. And if the player randomly receives a Track Group Distribution 2 track eRTP is calculated based on an optimum finish time 14.05 and a payout of 2. Not every track allows players to finish in the top payout. In fact Track Group Distribution 5 tracks ensure players finish outside of any and receive zero payout.

Not every track allows the player to achieve the Maximum Available Payout. But the game is designed to help the player receive the Maximum Available Payout possible for each track. This is a radical shift in game design for both slot machines and video games. This math model allows players to win the Maximum Available Payout possible. Tracks are designed to balance the challenge of competition with the rush of winning. Players win much more often than a traditional reel slot machine.

In a race game there is an optimum path on a racetrack. This is the best possible line the driver and car can navigate given the physics of the world and the skill of the driver. This optimum path can be computed using pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra s Algorithm and the A Algorithm.

The race game engineers a software simulator to prove the theoretical and mathematical models outlined above. This software simulator is designed to visualize tracks and outcomes as described for the race Game. The software is an implementation of a shortest path algorithm specifically tailored to using graphs created from state transition tables. The software applies a path finding algorithm to determine optimum play in a game.

In the simplest sense referring to each segment of a track can be converted into spots or cells whereby each cell takes one 1 second to traverse. The following table outlines the basic elements of a track including Start Finish Straight Left Corner and Right Corner.

Furthermore referring to in particular embodiments these tables outline examples of theoretical tracks in Distributions 1 5 respectively. Each table represents a single complete and unique playable track in the game. The name of the track is a user defined label to help identify the track. The distribution name is the distribution range the track is a subset of and is determined by the tracks optimal time value. The optimal time is calculated based on the configuration of track elements which are arrayed in sequence from the starting element S to the finish element F to form the actual design of the track. The shortest path algorithm used is in parallel with the software simulator.

While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations changes and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention.

In another example not illustrated a player tries to control the path of a virtual projectile so that a designated number of targets is each hit by a projectile a designated number of times. In some embodiments a given target only requires a single hit in order to count towards the Key Scores. In some other embodiments a given target requires two or more hits in order to counts towards the Key Scores. In some embodiments different targets have different minimum hits required. In certain variation the number of hits required for a given target is known to the player. In certain variations the number of hits required for a given target is unknown to the player. In some embodiments all targets appear the same. In some embodiments all targets have the same general appearance except for size and possibly lighting in order to imply varying distance from the player. In come embodiments a first target has a significantly different appearance from a second target. In some embodiments no target changes position relative to the background. In some embodiments at least one target changes position relative to the background.

In some embodiments the point of view of the player does not change during the play of the game. In some embodiments the player is able to pan their point of view horizontally and or vertically. In some embodiments the player is able to laterally shift their point of view typically along the x axis of the same z plane. In some embodiments the player is able to shift their point of view in two or more axis of movement such as being able to move their position within a virtual 3d target field. In some embodiments the view from a specific position does not vary. In some other embodiments a first view from a specific position is different from a second view from the same position. In some variations this is due to the simulation of viewing though a telescopic device. In some such telescopic view simulations there is only one magnification available. In some other such telescopic view simulations there is more than one magnification available. In some embodiments a first view is association with the selection of a first projectile while a second view is associated with selection of a second projectile. For example the view displayed when a virtual sniper rifle is the selected as the source of the next projectile is different from the view displayed with a virtual rocket launcher is selected as the source of the next projectile.

In some embodiments there are no obstructions between the source of the projectile and all available targets. Is some embodiments a first target may partially or completely block the view of a second target. In some embodiments other visual elements in the game may partially or completely block the view of a target which is otherwise located within the confines of the visible play field. In some variations changes in the player s view whether by panning and or by shifting position change the visibility of targets within the confines of the visible play field.

In some embodiments the player has a limited number of projectiles. In some other embodiments the player has an unlimited number of projectiles. In some embodiments the player can only fire or launch a projectile if it is guaranteed to hit a target. In some embodiments the player can fire or launch a projectile which does not hit any designated targets. In some embodiments all projectiles have the same characteristics. In some other embodiments a first projectile has at least one characteristic different from a second projectile available in the game. For example a first projectile can score a different hit count on a given target than a second projectile. In some variations the quantity and ordering of first projectiles and second projectiles is the same from game to game. In some other variations the quantity and or ordering of first projectiles and second projects is not guaranteed to be the same from game to game. In some variations the player can select whether to fire or launch a first projectile or a second projectile. In some other variations the player has no control on the selection of projectiles.

In some embodiments there is no significant time delay between the player initiating the firing or launching of a projectile and the corresponding effect whether that be a target hit or target miss. In some embodiments there is a significant enough time delay between the player initiating the firing or launching of a projectile and the corresponding effect whether that be a target hit or target miss that the motion of target relative to the view whether due to a target changing position relative to the background or the view changing relative to the background or both can affect whether or not a hit is attained. In some embodiments with projectile travel delays all projectiles travel at the same speed. In some embodiments with projectile delays a first projectile travels at a first speed while a second projectile travels at a second speed.

In some embodiments projectiles always travel an idealized straight path. In some embodiments projectiles travel in a non linear path such as a parabolic path to simulate the effect of gravity or such as a complex path to simulate the effects of gravity and friction. In some embodiments projectiles never experience changes in path due to simulated wind or other environmental factors. In some embodiments simulated wind or other environmental factors affect the positioning of a projectile s path. For example a simulated cross wind which produces a windage effect on the point of projectile input. In some embodiments simulated wind or other environmental factors affect the length of the projectile s path. For example a simulated head wind which slows a projectile or a simulated tail win that speeds up a projectile. In some embodiments the designated point of aim only changes based on player input. In some other embodiments the designated point of aim changes without player input such as to simulate real world wobble of the aiming device.

Player is given 30 seconds to knock down as many moving ducks as possible. There are three different sized targets. The smallest target awards 5 points the medium size target award 4 points and the largest target awards 3 points when hit. The largest target requires 2 hits anywhere on the target to knock down. The medium size target is knocked down with a single hit but only if the hit occurs on a bullseye marked portion of the medium sized target. The smallest target is knocked down with a single hit anywhere.

The type and number of moving targets varies per target field. Also varying are the size and number of blocking elements namely pig targets and cow targets that only serve as projectile blockers.

The player manipulates X Y controls to move an onscreen rifle scope reticle icon which indicates point of aim and presses a different control to shoot. If the reticle is not aligned with a target at the instant the shot is initiated then the shot is a miss. Panning and position shifting are not available.

At the end of play if the player has attained a certain number of points or higher the player wins a payout defined by the Paytable.

Player is given 30 seconds to knock down as many enemy figures as possible. There are six different looking enemy figures that can appear. The number of hits required for a given enemy figure is randomly selected when the enemy figure is initialized relative to a weighted table of hit thresholds for that type of enemy figure.

The type number arrival and positioning of enemy figures varies per target field. This includes the number of enemy figures present within any particular area of the play field and the timing of the appearance of enemy figures.

The player manipulates X Y controls to move an onscreen rifle scope reticle icon which indicates point of aim and presses a different control to shoot. The potential target area is much wider than is shown at any one time. The player manipulates a left right control to shift the view position accordingly. View shifting also changes parallax between mid ground elements and targets such that a given target may not be fully visible at every screen position 

At the end of play if the player has attained a certain number of downed enemy targets or higher the player wins a payout defined by the Paytable.

When a player plays a first person shooter game a pre created target field is randomly selected. Each such target field has an optimal way of scoring as many hits as possible for the given set of targets blockers and their relative positioning.

Each target field is created using a design filter and test methodology. Target fields are designed from a defined pool of elements or symbols. Each target field is designed such that the optimum targeting behavior is within the required range Target field are algorithmically tested and filtered to remove tracks that do not exactly conform to the specified optimal hit results. Target field that passes the automated testing filtering will then be tested qualitatively by humans.

Regardless of the target field the Paytable will remain fixed. Although every target field will be created so that the player feels as if they re able to achieve the top prize sometimes it is not possible for the player to achieve every outcome for any particular target field.

A player who plays perfectly will obtain the highest Key Score available within each target field which does not always correspond to the Key Score required to win the top award listed in the Paytable. Therefore the weighted distribution of the selection of target fields is constructed to generate the desired long term expected eRTP. eRTP total maxPayout targetField1 probability targetField1Selection maxPayout targetField2 probability targetField2Selection . . . maxPayout targetFieldN probability targetFieldNSelection 

Many players will make mistakes and sub optimal choices significant enough to prevent them from earning the highest winnable prize for the given target field. In order to keep lower skill players from losing too much RTP additional sources of payout which are based on player s lack of skill are incorporated into the game.

In some embodiments a player is occasionally awarded additional payouts relative to his her actual Key Score within a game at one or more specific times. For example in the Duck Shooting sample game actual Key Score would be the points acquired at the time of checking. For the 3D Shooter sample game actual Key Score would be the number of enemy figures downed at the time of checking. In some embodiments a player is occasionally awarded additional payouts relative to his her actual progress within a game at one or more specific times. For example in the Duck Shooting sample game actual progress would be determined based on the number of points earned and the number of large targets with one of the two required hits. For the 3D Shooter sample game actual Key Score would be based on the number of enemy figures downed and the number of hits scored on still standing enemy figures at the time of checking. In some embodiments a player is occasionally awarded additional payouts relative to his her ancillary progress within a game at one or more specific times where said ancillary progress had a high correlation to skillful play. For example for the 3D shooter sample game ancillary progress could include a number of total hits or b average time between shots on the same target or c average time between downing on target and placing first hit on a different target or the number of missed shots between the first shot that hits a given target and the last shot that downs same said target or d any suitable metric.
