A body part relief image scanning device scanner such as a fingerprint recognition device is used for a variety of purposes including security. A person s body part can contact a surface of the scanner where an image may be captured of the body part such as a finger print or some other biometric marker. The resulting image may be compared to a database of body part images to verify the person s identity for example. A body part relief print image device may use an electrode based electro luminescence component that can utilize an electrical connection between a relief object and the electro luminescence component.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Accordingly among other things one or more techniques and or systems are disclosed for mitigating a perceived electric shock to a user of a body part relief print image device. As an example a base current e.g. an electrical current having a first current configuration may be used to capture an initial image e.g. a first image of the body part relief print and if based on an analysis of the resulting image one or more subsequent images may be captured using modified current characteristics.

In one implementation where a perceived electrical sensation may be mitigated for a relief print scanning device a current determination component can identify a desired current configuration for electrical current that is provided to an electroluminescent based relief print scanning device. In this implementation the desired current configuration can be identified based on a first image characteristic of a first relief print image where the first relief print image may be provided by the relief print scanning device while utilizing a first current configuration of the electrical current. Further in this implementation a current adjusting component which is operably coupled with the current determination component may adjust the first current configuration to a second current configuration where the adjustment can be based on current adjustment data that is provided by the current determination component.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

A user of a relief print scanner for example that comprises an electro luminescent based film typically places their finger on the surface of the scanner in contact with both the surface film and a contact electrode. As a non limiting example the contact electrode can be a source of electrical current that may be used to activate the electro luminescent particles in the film where the electrical current passes through the user s finger to the surface film. In one implementation an electro luminescent based relief print scanning device may comprise an electro luminescent based film that operates in a voltage range of about sixty to about six hundred volts e.g. 60 600 VAC inclusive. In this example a user of this type of scanner may perceive an electrical sensation e.g. electrical shock which in some instances may be somewhat uncomfortable. In one implementation the perceived electrical sensation may be reduced by reducing one or more characteristics of the electrical current e.g. voltage and or frequency thereby improving the user s comfort during use.

In one implementation the relief print generator may comprise an electrode based e.g. single electrode electro luminescence component and or an electrical connection e.g. a power source such as an A C source which may provide an electrical connection between a relief object and the electro luminescence component . Further in one implementation the electrode based electro luminescence component may comprise a transparent electrode e.g. comprising an indium tin oxide ITO material which may be attached to a polymer substrate a luminescent layer and or a dielectric layer e.g. a conductive insulating layer that allows current to pass . In one implementation the relief print generator and the sensor arrangement may be separated at a distance to each other or may be arranged such that the sensor arrangement is in contact with the relief print generator . As one example when a relief print recognition system is activated e.g. by placing a finger at an image capture location light produced by the luminescent layer is emitted in respective directions such as directed toward the sensor arrangement .

In an example implementation of a portion of a luminescent element can comprise a light emitting layer such as an electro luminescence layer. In this implementation the light emitting layer can be comprised of fluorescent particles and a binder material . In one implementation the electro luminescent particles may comprise activated particles such as when subjected to an electrical current . Further in this implementation the activated particles may emit photons for example thereby producing light when subjected to the electrical current .

In the example implementation of the portion of the luminescent element can comprise a dielectric layer and a transparent electrode . In this example implementation the dielectric layer is resident over the top portion of and in contact with the light emitting layer and the transparent electrode is resident under the bottom portion of and in contact with the light emitting layer . Further the example implementation of the portion of the luminescent element can comprise a power source such as an alternating current AC power source having an electrode connection in electrical connection with the transparent electrode and a contact electrode e.g. an object contact electrode residing substantially adjacent to a contact surface e.g. top surface of the dielectric layer .

In one implementation a relief object may contact both the contact surface of the dielectric layer and the contact electrode . In this implementation for example upon contacting both the dielectric layer and the object contact electrode an electrical circuit may be created between the contact electrode and the transparent electrode thereby allowing current to flow between the two electrodes. Further in this implementation those portions of the relief object e.g. body part relief ridges that come in contact with the contact surface of the dielectric layer can allow current to pass from the contact electrode to the dielectric layer . Additionally the current passing through the dielectric layer can activate the fluorescent particles merely at the location of the contact. Upon activation the activated particles may emit photons merely at the location of the contact of the portions of the relief object e.g. fingerprint ridges . In this way for example an illuminated relief print e.g. fingerprint of the relief object e.g. finger may be produced when the relief object contacts both the contact electrode and the contact surface of the dielectric layer .

As shown in a relief print scanner can comprise an image sensor portion that may be used to capture an optical image e.g. an image of a fingerprint by converting incoming photons into an electronic signal for example for later digital processing of the captured image. In one implementation the image sensor portion may comprise a thin film sensor array. For example a thin film sensor array may be used to detect photons emitted by a light emitting component e.g. the luminescent element of . Here as an example the image sensor portion can detect light produced by the light emitting component e.g. produced in the form of a relief print and produce an image using a photo current by converting the detected photons into an electrical signal.

In the example implementation a photo sensitive layer e.g. comprising SiH amorphous silicon may be formed between a first source electrode and a first drain electrode of a light sensing unit . When an electrical charge is applied to a first gate electrode the photo sensitive layer becomes responsive to light for example where the photo sensitive layer may become electrically conductive when incident to photons of light. As one example when light is incident on the photo sensitive layer over a predetermined threshold light amount the first source electrode and the first drain electrode may become electrically connected. Therefore in this example light generated from the light emitting component e.g. comprising a fingerprint pattern may be received by the photo sensitive layer which may cause an electrical signal to pass from the first source electrode to the first drain electrode e.g. providing an electronic signal indicative of the light received .

Further a switching unit of the image sensor portion can comprise a second source electrode a second drain electrode and an intrinsic semiconductor layer . As one example when a negative charge is applied to a second gate electrode the intrinsic semiconductor layer may become electrically conductive thereby allowing the electrical signal created at the light sensing unit to pass from the second source electrode to the second drain electrode e.g. and to an electrical signal reading component for converting to a digital image . In this way for example the switching unit may be used to control when an electrical signal indicative of a particular amount of light may be sent to an electrical signal reading component e.g. for processing purposes and or to mitigate signal interference with neighboring light sensing units .

Additionally in this implementation a light shielding layer may be resident over the top portion of the switching unit . As one example the light shielding layer may mitigate intrusion of light to the intrinsic semiconductor layer as light can affect the electrical conductivity of the intrinsic semiconductor layer . The image sensor portion may also comprise a substrate of any suitable material onto which the layers of the image sensor portion may be formed. As one example when a relief object e.g. of comes into contact with a contact electrode and a contact surface e.g. top surface of the light emitting component an electrical current may pass from the contact electrode through the relief object and into the light emitting component . In this example the light emitting component may emit photons that are incident to the photo sensitive layer thereby allowing an electrical signal e.g. indicative of the number of photons received to pass from the first source electrode to the second drain electrode and to a signal reading component.

In the implementations and the contact electrode can comprise a conductive element disposed at least partially around a perimeter of a print scanning surface . In this way for example when a relief object is applied to the print scanning surface at least a portion of the relief object may contact the contact electrode . In the example implementation of the contact electrode can comprise one or more electrode connections e.g. of . As one example the one or more electrode connections may electrically couple with the current generator which may further couple with the transparent electrode. Further the shape design location of the contact electrode is not limited to those illustrated in the example implementations for example the contact electrode may comprise any shape circle square rectangle dot line grid etc. appropriate for the application and or may be located merely at one portion e.g. side corner etc. of the surface.

As provided herein a system may be devised that provides for mitigating a perceived electrical current for a relief object scanner. As an example a perceivable current for a human may depend on the current type e.g. alternating or direct and or a current frequency e.g. in Hertz Hz . For example as little as 1 milliampere mA of alternating current AC e.g. 5 mA of direct current DC 12 mA of AC at 10 kHz may be perceived by a person at 60 Hz resulting in a perceived electrical shock. While these types of electrical shocks typically present little or no danger to a person they may be uncomfortable to the scannee whose relief prints are being scanned.

In one aspect a reduction in the voltage for the relief object scanner device may be implemented for example where an amount of reduction may be based on circumstances at a time of relief object scanning. Further the current used to scan a relief object may be increased for example merely at the time the relief object contacts a scanning surface of the relief object scanner device. In one implementation data indicative of one or more relief object scanning variables may be collected and processed at the time of relief object scanning. In this implementation the data may be used to identify a desired voltage and or current e.g. or some other characteristic of current such as resistance electrical impedance frequency and or amperage for the scanning that can provide a more comfortable experience to the scannee while also providing a desired image quality for the resulting image of the relief object.

In the exemplary system the current adjusting component is operably coupled with the current determination component . The current adjusting component is configured to adjust the first current configuration resulting in a second current configuration based at least upon current adjustment data provided by the current determination component . In one implementation the current adjusting component can adjust at least one characteristic of the electrical current provided to the electroluminescent based relief print scanning device resulting in an adjusted current configuration.

For example one or more current characteristics may include a voltage amperage frequency resistance and or impedance. As one example decreasing or increasing an amount of voltage provided to the relief print scanning device may also decrease or increase a perceived electrical shock felt by a user of the relief print scanning device . Therefore in this example the current configuration comprising a particular amount of voltage provided to the relief print scanning device may be identified by the current monitoring component and this current characteristic e.g. voltage level may be provided to the current determination component . In one implementation one or more current characteristics comprised in the current configuration e.g. first current configuration may be identified and provided to the current determination component by the current monitoring component . For example one or more of the provided current s voltage amperage frequency resistance and or impedance may be identified for the first current configuration.

In the example implementation of an image determination component may be configured to identify one or more image characteristics e.g. a first image characteristic of a relief print image e.g. the first relief print image provided by the relief print scanning device . As one example the relief print scanning device may capture a relief print image using the provided current having the first current configuration and the image determination component can identify one or more image characteristics from the relief print image . Further the one or more image characteristics may be provided to the current determination component which may have also received the one or more identified current characteristics e.g. comprised in the first current configuration for example for the provided current e.g. the first current configuration used to produce the relief print image .

In one implementation one or more image characteristics may include brightness contrast edge detection object detection luminance luma noise and or chrominance. As one example decreasing or increasing an amount of voltage e.g. and or one or more other current characteristics provided to the relief print scanning device may also decrease or increase a brightness of a resulting relief print image from the relief print scanning device . Therefore in this example an amount of brightness e.g. in the relief print image may be identified by the image determination component and this image characteristic can be provided to the current determination component . In one implementation one or more image characteristics may be identified and provided to the current determination component .

With continued reference to in one implementation the current determination component can be configured to compare an image characteristic e.g. the first image characteristic of a relief print image e.g. the first relief print image with a corresponding image characteristic threshold resulting in current adjustment data if the image characteristic does not meet the corresponding image characteristic threshold . Further in one implementation the corresponding image characteristic threshold can be indicative of a relief print image that comprises data usable for relief print recognition.

In one implementation the current determination component can be configured to identify the current adjustment data where the current adjustment data comprise an indication to the current adjusting component to adjust the current to an adjusted current configuration e.g. the second current configuration . That is for example the current monitoring component e.g. an electrical sensor or transducer can identify the first current configuration for the current comprising predetermined levels for current characteristics such as voltage resistance electrical impedance frequency and or amperage. In this example the relief print scanner can capture a first image e.g. using the current having the first current configuration. The image determination component can identify one or more first image characteristics e.g. such as brightness contrast edge detection object detection luminance chrominance noise and or luma and provide them to the current determination component . The current determination component in this example may compare the one or more first image characteristics to corresponding image threshold values to determine whether the image comprises a usable image for relief print recognition e.g. bright enough enough contrast appropriate edges objects low noise etc. .

Further in this example if one or more threshold values are not met by the first image characteristic s the current determination component can determine current variation data . For example the current variation data may comprise information indicative of an adjustment for one or more of the current characteristics resulting in a second current configuration. For example the second current configuration may comprise a change in voltage e.g. increase to a predetermined second voltage level a change in resistance e.g. decrease to predetermined second resistance level a change in electrical impedance e.g. decrease to a predetermined second impedance level a change in frequency e.g. increase to a predetermined second frequency level and or a change in amperage e.g. increase to a predetermined second amperage level.

Further in this example the change to the second current configuration may be adjusted by the current adjusting component thereby providing adjusted electrical current to the relief print scanner during capture of a second relief print image . Again the second relief print image can be analyzed for example by the image determination component to identify one or more second image characteristics which can be compared to the one or more image characteristic thresholds by the current determination component . If the one or more second image characteristic thresholds meet the respective image characteristic thresholds the second relief print image may be used for example for relief print recognition e.g. security identification etc. and or for storage e.g. image collection . Alternately if the one or more image thresholds are not met the process may be iterated to create a third current configuration a third relief print image etc. e.g. and a fourth fifth etc. until a desired image is captured .

In one implementation the first current configuration of the electrical current can comprise an available configuration in an operating range for the electro luminescent based film disposed in the electroluminescent based relief print scanning device that provides a desired level of perceived electrical sensation to a user. That is for example the initial setting for the current configuration may comprise the lowest voltage e.g. or other current characteristic in an operating range for the relief print scanner . In this way for example there is a higher chance that the user may be provided a more comfortable image capture experience.

Further in one implementation the second current configuration can comprise a next available configuration in the operating range for the electro luminescent based film that provides a next level of perceived electrical sensation to the user. That is for example if the first current configuration does not provide a useable image the second current configuration e.g. comprise a next higher level of voltage may be able to provide the usable image while still remaining at a low enough level to mitigate the electrical sensation to the user. In this way for example the electrical characteristics may be stepped up sequentially at least until a usable image is obtained thereby providing an electrical current configuration to the user that has a least perceived electrical sensation.

As provided herein a method may be devised that provides for mitigating a perceived electrical current for a relief object scanner. As one example a reduction in the voltage e.g. or a change in some other current characteristic for the relief object scanner device can be used to reduce the perceived electrical shock. For example the reduction of voltage e.g. or change of current can be based on characteristics of a resulting image. Further the current can be altered at the time the relief object contacts the scanning surface of the relief object scanner device.

If the first image characteristic does not meet the first image characteristic threshold NO at an electrical current characteristic of the first current configuration may be adjusted at resulting in a second electrical configuration. Here at least a portion of the resulting second current configuration comprising the adjusted electrical current can be used to capture a second relief print image using the electroluminescent based relief print scanning device . For example an electrical current providing component may adjust an output of the electrical current based on the adjusted electrical current characteristics at . The adjusted electrical current may be used by the electro luminescent relief print scanner to capture an image of the relief print object e.g. fingerprint . In one implementation the process may be iterated at least until one or more image characteristics meet the desired threshold at . Having met the desired threshold at and using the image at the exemplary method ends at .

As one example the relief print scanning device may have a baseline standard for a current configuration comprising a baseline set of current characteristics where the baseline set of current characteristics comprise a desired current level e.g. providing a lowest perceived electrical sensation to a user that may still yield a useable image e.g. one that can be used to identify match the resulting print with a database print . In one implementation the current provided to the device may be set at the device s baseline standard e.g. comprising the lowest voltage frequency amperage and or highest resistance or impedance . In this implementation for example the baseline current characteristics may mitigate the perceived electrical shock to the user.

At in the example implementation a relief print image may be captured using the provided current e.g. the first electrical configuration set to the baseline . As described above an electrical current is supplied to a contact electrode which can be contacted by the scannee e.g. user when touching the scanning surface of the device for example. In this example the provided current can be used to create an image of the relief print e.g. as described in at the starting electrical configuration e.g. the baseline standard . Further in one implementation the current may be provided to the contact electrode merely at the moment the relief print object contacts both the scanning surface and the contact electrode such as by a current provider e.g. of of of of and or of that is configured to provide electrical current to the contact electrode e.g. of of and or of . In this way in this example a perceived electrical shock may be mitigated as the current may not build up at the contact electrode prior to imaging e.g. which can result in a higher perceived electrical shock .

At a resulting image can be analyzed. As described above the relief print device can produce an image of the relief print where the initial image e.g. first relief print image of can comprise image characteristics for example which may be associated with the current configuration used to produce the image. As one example a particular voltage and or frequency may yield a particular image brightness and or contrast for the image which may also be affected by environmental conditions at the time of collection e.g. temperature humidity dryness of object cleanliness of object and or scanner etc. . In this implementation the image brightness may be analyzed at and the image contrast can be analyzed at . Image brightness and image contrast are merely two of a plurality of image characteristics that may be used to characterize an image s quality e.g. edge detection object detection luminance luma and or chrominance and the subject matter described herein is not limited only to those implementations described herein.

At the one or more image characteristics identified at can respectively be compared against an associated threshold. In one implementation the analysis can comprise comparing the first image characteristic with a first image characteristic threshold to determine whether the image characteristic meets the desired threshold. As one example an image s brightness level and or contrast level may affect the device s ability to detect the relief print and or compare the print against a comparison database of prints. Therefore for example an image brightness level threshold and or an image contrast level threshold may be compared against the one or more image characteristics identified for the image. As an example an image brightness for an image may comprise and average e.g. or some other suitable statistic brightness value for the respective pixels in the image. As another example likewise the image contrast for an image may comprise and average e.g. or some other suitable statistic contrast value for the respective contrasting pixels in the image.

In one implementation comparing the first image characteristic with the first image characteristic threshold can comprise determining whether the first relief print image comprises data that is usable for relief print recognition. That is for example if the image does not comprise a desired number of relief print edges or objects e.g. indicative of the ridges of a fingerprint the image may not be useable for relief print recognition e.g. comparison storage and identification .

If the one or more image characteristics meets e.g. or exceeds their corresponding image characteristic threshold YES at the example implementation can end at for example and the resulting image may be utilized by the relief print object scanning device e.g. for storage and or identification . If the one or more image characteristics does not meet their corresponding image characteristic threshold NO at the starting current settings for the relief print object scanning device may be adjusted to a next level at . In one implementation a second electrical current configuration can be identified if the first image characteristic does not meet the first image characteristic threshold.

In one implementation identifying the second electrical configuration can comprise adjusting the electrical current configuration to a next available configuration in the operating range for the electro luminescent based film that provides a next level of perceived electrical sensation to the user. In this implementation one or more characteristics of the electrical configuration may be identified for adjustment including voltage resistance electrical impedance electrical frequency and or amperage. As one example a voltage level for the current provided to the scanning device may be increased by a desired amount e.g. determined by empirical evidence and used to collect a second image where the second current configuration provides a next lowest perceived electrical sensation to the user.

Returning to a second image can be collected by the relief print scanning device using the second current configuration comprising the adjusted current e.g. adjusted to the next level . The resulting image e.g. second relief print image may be analyzed at and the identified image characteristic s can be compared against the threshold s . If the image is suitable e.g. usable for relief print recognition for example the example implementation may end at . However if one or more of the thresholds are not met the process may be iterated at least until a suitable image is identified. In this way for example the current provided to the scanning devices is merely incremented enough to provide a suitable image which may result in a lower perceived electrical shock to a user of the device.
