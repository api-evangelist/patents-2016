The present Application for Patent is a Divisional of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 13 925 066 entitled UPDATING RICH COMMUNICATION SUITE CAPABILITY INFORMATION OVER A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK filed on Jun. 24 2013 which is assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Embodiments of the invention relate to updating rich communication suite RCS capability information over a communications network.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and third generation 3G and fourth generation 4G high speed data Internet capable wireless services. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

More recently Long Term Evolution LTE has been developed as a wireless communications protocol for wireless communication of high speed data for mobile phones and other data terminals. LTE is based on GSM and includes contributions from various GSM related protocols such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS protocols such as High Speed Packet Access HSPA .

Access networks using various communication protocols e.g. 3GPP access networks such as W CDMA LTE etc. or non 3GPP access networks such as WiFi WLAN or wired LAN etc. can be configured to provide Internet Protocol IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS services via an IMS network managed by an operator e.g. Verizon Sprint AT T etc. to users across a communications system. Users that access the IMS network to request an IMS service are assigned to one of a plurality of regional application servers or application server clusters e.g. groups of application servers that serve the same cluster region for supporting the requested IMS service.

Rich Communications Suite RCS is a recently developed service type in the IMS domain. RCS permits users to query device capabilities and or application level multimedia capabilities from their contacts such that a client device can update the capabilities of the contacts in its address book in real time and thus enable rich communication such as Voice over LTE VoLTE video calls Instant Messaging IM file or image sharing etc. based on the real time capabilities of the contacts. In the current RCS standard UEs send a UE to UE or peer to peer Session Initiation Protocol SIP OPTIONS message to one or more target UEs to request the UE specific RCS capabilities of the target UEs. The SIP OPTIONS message includes the RCS capabilities of the transmitting UE and the SIP OPTIONS message prompts the target UE to respond to the SIP OPTIONS message with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities of the target UE. Thus the exchange of the SIP OPTIONS and SIP 200 OK messages is a peer to peer handshaking process that is mediated by the IMS network and by which both endpoints update their respective RCS capabilities for the other endpoint.

For example UE can send a SIP OPTIONS message to UE over an IMS network that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and requests UE to respond back to UE with an indication of the RCS capabilities of UE UE can send a SIP OPTIONS message to UE over the IMS network that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and requests UE to respond back to UE with an indication of the RCS capabilities of UE and so on. UE then responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from UE with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities UE responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from UE with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and so on.

As will be appreciated in the current RCS standard the overall messaging associated with RCS capability discovery scales linearly with the number of UEs for which RCS capability information is requested. In the example from above if UE desires to update the RCS capability for a high number of target UEs this will in turn cause a relatively high amount of traffic between UE and the target UEs.

In an embodiment a requesting UE configures an RCS capabilities request message to request a target UE to provide RCS capability information i for the target UE and ii for a set of other UEs. The requesting UE transmits the configured RCS capabilities request message to the target UE. The target UE determines that the target UE has access to RCS capability information for at least one UE from the set of other UEs and configures an RCS capabilities response message that indicates the RCS capability information i for the target UE and ii for the at least one UE. The target UE transmits the configured RCS capabilities response message to the requesting UE. In another embodiment a given UE determines whether to perform an RCS capability information refresh operation based on whether RCS capability information for another UE is older than a priority specific age threshold.

Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks WiFi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. CDMA EVDO eHRPD GSM EDGE W CDMA LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs eNode Bs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of WiFi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE or UE over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. for a WiFi router with both wired and wireless connectivity .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet .

Examples of protocol specific implementations for the RAN and the core network are provided below with respect to to help explain the wireless communications system in more detail. In particular the components of the RAN and the core network corresponds to components associated with supporting packet switched PS communications whereby legacy circuit switched CS components may also be present in these networks but any legacy CS specific components are not shown explicitly in .

In the core network includes the above noted SGSN B and potentially a number of other SGSNs as well and a GGSN B. Generally GPRS is a protocol used in GSM for routing IP packets. The GPRS core network e.g. the GGSN B and one or more SGSNs B is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W CDMA based 3G access networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network i.e. the core network that provides mobility management session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W CDMA networks.

The GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users e.g. UEs of a GSM or W CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the Internet as if from one location at the GGSN B. This is achieved by transferring the respective UE s data from the UE s current SGSN B to the GGSN B which is handling the respective UE s session.

Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network namely i GTP U ii GTP C and iii GTP GTP Prime . GTP U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol PDP context. GTP C is used for control signaling e.g. setup and deletion of PDP contexts verification of GSN reach ability updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another etc. . GTP is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.

Referring to the GGSN B acts as an interface between a GPRS backbone network not shown and the Internet . The GGSN B extracts packet data with associated a packet data protocol PDP format e.g. IP or PPP from GPRS packets coming from the SGSN B and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN connected UE to the SGSN B which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer RAB of a target UE served by the RAN . Thereby the GGSN B stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and its associated profile in a location register e.g. within a PDP context . The GGSN B is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for a connected UE. The GGSN B also performs authentication and charging functions.

The SGSN B is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN B includes packet routing and transfer mobility management e.g. attach detach and location management logical link management and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN B stores location information e.g. current cell current VLR and user profiles e.g. IMSI PDP address es used in the packet data network of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN B for example within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus SGSNs B are responsible for i de tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN B ii uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN B iii carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and iv billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art aside from i iv SGSNs configured for GSM EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W CDMA networks.

The RAN e.g. or UTRAN in UMTS system architecture communicates with the SGSN B via a Radio Access Network Application Part RANAP protocol. RANAP operates over a Iu interface Iu ps with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN B communicates with the GGSN B via a Gn interface which is an IP based interface between SGSN B and other SGSNs not shown and internal GGSNs not shown and uses the GTP protocol defined above e.g. GTP U GTP C GTP etc. . In the embodiment of the Gn between the SGSN B and the GGSN B carries both the GTP C and the GTP U. While not shown in the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System DNS . The GGSN B is connected to a Public Data Network PDN not shown and in turn to the Internet via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol WAP gateway.

In the core network includes a plurality of Mobility Management Entities MMEs D and D a Home Subscriber Server HSS D a Serving Gateway S GW D a Packet Data Network Gateway P GW D and a Policy and Charging Rules Function PCRF D. Network interfaces between these components the RAN and the Internet are illustrated in and are defined in Table 1 below as follows 

A high level description of the components shown in the RAN and core network of will now be described. However these components are each well known in the art from various 3GPP TS standards and the description contained herein is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all functionalities performed by these components.

Referring to the MMEs D and D are configured to manage the control plane signaling for the EPS bearers. MME functions include Non Access Stratum NAS signaling NAS signaling security Mobility management for inter and intra technology handovers P GW and S GW selection and MME selection for handovers with MME change.

Referring to the S GW D is the gateway that terminates the interface toward the RAN . For each UE associated with the core network for an EPS based system at a given point of time there is a single S GW. The functions of the S GW D for both the GTP based and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 PMIP based S5 S8 include Mobility anchor point Packet routing and forwarding and setting the DiffServ Code Point DSCP based on a QoS Class Identifier QCI of the associated EPS bearer.

Referring to the P GW D is the gateway that terminates the SGi interface toward the Packet Data Network PDN e.g. the Internet . If a UE is accessing multiple PDNs there may be more than one P GW for that UE however a mix of S5 S8 connectivity and Gn Gp connectivity is not typically supported for that UE simultaneously. P GW functions include for both the GTP based S5 S8 Packet filtering by deep packet inspection UE IP address allocation setting the DSCP based on the QCI of the associated EPS bearer accounting for inter operator charging uplink UL and downlink DL bearer binding as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 UL bearer binding verification as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to both GSM EDGE Radio Access Network GERAN UTRAN only UEs and E UTRAN capable UEs using any of E UTRAN GERAN or UTRAN. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to E UTRAN capable UEs using E UTRAN only over the S5 S8 interface.

Referring to the PCRF D is the policy and charging control element of the EPS based core network . In a non roaming scenario there is a single PCRF in the HPLMN associated with a UE s Internet Protocol Connectivity Access Network IP CAN session. The PCRF terminates the Rx interface and the Gx interface. In a roaming scenario with local breakout of traffic there may be two PCRFs associated with a UE s IP CAN session A Home PCRF H PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a HPLMN and a Visited PCRF V PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a visited VPLMN. PCRF is described in more detail in 3GPP TS 23.203 and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity. In the application server e.g. which can be referred to as the AF in 3GPP terminology is shown as connected to the core network via the Internet or alternatively to the PCRF D directly via an Rx interface. Generally the application server or AF is an element offering applications that use IP bearer resources with the core network e.g. UMTS PS domain GPRS domain resources LTE PS data services . One example of an application function is the Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS Core Network sub system. The AF uses the Rx reference point to provide session information to the PCRF D. Any other application server offering IP data services over cellular network can also be connected to the PCRF D via the Rx reference point.

In the eHRPD RAN includes a plurality of base transceiver stations BTSs E E and E which are connected to an enhanced BSC eBSC and enhanced PCF ePCF E. The eBSC ePCF E can connect to one of the MMEs D or D within the EPS core network A over an S101 interface and to an HRPD serving gateway HSGW E over A10 and or A11 interfaces for interfacing with other entities in the EPS core network A e.g. the S GW D over an S103 interface the P GW D over an S2a interface the PCRF D over a Gxa interface a 3GPP AAA server not shown explicitly in over an STa interface etc. . The HSGW E is defined in 3GPP2 to provide the interworking between HRPD networks and EPS LTE networks. As will be appreciated the eHRPD RAN and the HSGW E are configured with interface functionality to EPC LTE networks that is not available in legacy HRPD networks.

Turning back to the eHRPD RAN in addition to interfacing with the EPS LTE network A the eHRPD RAN can also interface with legacy HRPD networks such as HRPD network B. As will be appreciated the HRPD network B is an example implementation of a legacy HRPD network such as the EV DO network from . For example the eBSC ePCF E can interface with an authentication authorization and accounting AAA server E via an A12 interface or to a PDSN FA E via an A10 or A11 interface. The PDSN FA E in turn connects to HA E through which the Internet can be accessed. In certain interfaces e.g. A13 A16 H1 H2 etc. are not described explicitly but are shown for completeness and would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art familiar with HRPD or eHRPD.

Referring to it will be appreciated that LTE core networks e.g. and HRPD core networks that interface with eHRPD RANs and HSGWs e.g. can support network initiated Quality of Service QoS e.g. by the P GW GGSN SGSN etc. in certain cases.

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE A or B one of BSs A through A one of Node Bs B through B one of eNodeBs D through D etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G CDMA W CDMA 3G 4G LTE etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. PDSN SGSN GGSN S GW P GW MME HSS PCRF the application etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM memory flash memory ROM memory EPROM memory EEPROM memory registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input . In an example the logic configured to receive local user input can include at least a user input device and associated hardware. For example the user input device can include buttons a touchscreen display a keyboard a camera an audio input device e.g. a microphone or a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack etc. and or any other device by which information can be received from a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to receive local user input can include the keypad A any of the buttons A or B through B the touchscreen display B etc. In a further example the logic configured to receive local user input can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an embodiment that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the embodiments described below in more detail.

The various embodiments may be implemented on any of a variety of commercially available server devices such as server illustrated in . In an example the server may correspond to one example configuration of the application server described above. In the server includes a processor coupled to volatile memory and a large capacity nonvolatile memory such as a disk drive . The server may also include a floppy disc drive compact disc CD or DVD disc drive coupled to the processor . The server may also include network access ports coupled to the processor for establishing data connections with a network such as a local area network coupled to other broadcast system computers and servers or to the Internet. In context with it will be appreciated that the server of illustrates one example implementation of the communication device whereby the logic configured to transmit and or receive information corresponds to the network access ports used by the server to communicate with the network the logic configured to process information corresponds to the processor and the logic configuration to store information corresponds to any combination of the volatile memory the disk drive and or the disc drive . The optional logic configured to present information and the optional logic configured to receive local user input are not shown explicitly in and may or may not be included therein. Thus helps to demonstrate that the communication device may be implemented as a server in addition to a UE implementation as in A or B as in .

Access networks using various communication protocols e.g. 3GPP access networks such as W CDMA LTE etc. as described above with respect to or non 3GPP access networks such as WiFi WLAN or wired LAN IEEE 802 IEEE 802.11 etc. can be configured to provide Internet Protocol IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS services via an IMS network managed by an operator e.g. Verizon Sprint AT T etc. to users across a communications system. Users that access the IMS network to request an IMS service are assigned to one of a plurality of regional application servers or application server clusters e.g. groups of application servers that serve the same cluster region for supporting the requested IMS service.

Referring to the IMS network is shown as illustrating a particular set of IMS components including a proxy call session control function P CSCF an interrogating CSCF I CSCF a serving CSCF S CSCF and a Home Subscriber Server HSS . The P CSCF I CSCF and S CSCF are sometimes referred to collectively as the CSCF and the CSCF is responsible for signaling via Session Initiation Protocol SIP between the Transport Plane Control Plane and the Application Plane of the IMS network .

Referring to the P CSCF of the P CSCF is responsible for interfacing directly with Transport Plane components and is the first point of signaling within the IMS network for any end point such as UEs . . . N. Once an endpoint acquires IP connectivity the end point will cause a registration event to occur by first signaling to the P CSCF . As the name implies the P CSCF is a proxy for SIP messages from end points to the rest of the IMS network . It is usually in a home network of the end point but may reside in a visited network of the end point. The P CSCF will use a DNS look up to identify a target I CSCF to send SIP messages which could be an I CSCF in its own network or another I CSCF across an administrative domain. The P CSCF can also be responsible for policy decisions e.g. via an integrated or standalone Policy Decision Function PDF in Releases 5 or 6 of IMS via a Policy Charging and Resource Function PCRF in Release 7 of IMS etc. .

Referring to the I CSCF of the main function of the I CSCF is to proxy between the P CSCF as entry point and S CSCF as control point for applications found in the Applications Plane. When the P CSCF receives a registration request SIP message it will perform a DNS look up to discover the appropriate I CSCF to route the message. Once the I CSCF receives the SIP message it will perform a look up operation with the HSS via Diameter to determine the S CSCF that is associated with the end point terminal. Once it receives this information it will forward the SIP message to the appropriate S CSCF for further treatment.

Referring to the S CSCF the S CSCF is responsible for interfacing with the Application Servers AS e.g. such as application servers . . . N in cluster region R or application servers . . . N in cluster region and so on in the Application Plane. Upon receiving a registration request SIP message from an I CSCF the S CSCF will query the HSS via Diameter protocol to register the terminal as being currently served by itself. Subsequent session establishment requires knowing which S CSCF is responsible for the terminal session control. As part of the registration process the S CSCF uses credentials it obtains from the query to the HSS to issue an SIP message challenge back to the initiating P CSCF to authenticate the terminal.

In addition to acting as a registrar the S CSCF is also responsible for routing SIP messages to the AS allowing for the Control Plane session control to interact with the Application Plane application logic. To do this the S CSCF uses information obtained from the HSS in the form of Initial Filter Criteria IFC that acts as triggers against inbound session establishment requests. The IFC includes rules that define how and where SIP messages should be routed to the various application servers that may reside in the Application Plane. The S CSCF may also act on Secondary Filter Criteria SFC obtained from the application servers during the course of messaging with them.

Referring to a UE that requests IMS service e.g. registration to set up or join a VoIP session a PTT session a group communication session etc. from the IMS network is assigned or registered to a target application server that is selected by the S CSCF as noted above. Generally the IMS network will attempt to select as the target application server an application server that is physically close to the UE and is also known to be capable of providing the requested IMS service.

Rich Communications Suite RCS is a recently developed service type in the IMS domain. RCS permits users to query device capabilities and or application level multimedia capabilities from their contacts such that a client device can update the capabilities of the contacts in its address book in real time and thus enable rich communication such as Voice over LTE VoLTE video calls Instant Messaging IM file or image sharing etc. based on the real time capabilities of the contacts. In the current RCS standard UEs send a UE to UE or peer to peer SIP OPTIONS message to one or more target UEs to request the UE specific RCS capabilities of the target UEs. The SIP OPTIONS message includes the RCS capabilities of the transmitting UE and the SIP OPTIONS message prompts the target UE to respond to the SIP OPTIONS message with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities of the target UE. Thus the exchange of the SIP OPTIONS and SIP 200 OK messages is a peer to peer handshaking process that is mediated by the IMS network and by which both endpoints update their respective RCS capabilities for the other endpoint.

For example UE can send a SIP OPTIONS message to UE over an IMS network that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and requests UE to respond back to UE with an indication of the RCS capabilities of UE UE can send a SIP OPTIONS message to UE over the IMS network that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and requests UE to respond back to UE with an indication of the RCS capabilities of UE and so on. UE then responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from UE with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities UE responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from UE with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and so on.

As will be appreciated in the current RCS standard the overall messaging associated with RCS capability discovery scales linearly with the number of UEs for which RCS capability information is requested. In the example from above if UE desires to update the RCS capability for a high number of target UEs this will in turn cause a relatively high amount of traffic between UE and the target UEs.

After performing the registration at UE determines to retrieve RCS capability information for each RCS contact in the first user s contact book . The RCS contacts in the first user s contact book can correspond to all of the first user s contacts in the contact book or a subset thereof. For example when UE boots for the first time it generally does not know RCS capabilities for each of its contacts. Thereby an initial RCS capability discovery procedure is performed to all of its contacts. Over time UE can query RCS capabilities more selectively so that contacts that never report any RCS capability are excluded after a threshold number of inquiries. Thus if the registration of is an initial registration after an initial boot of UE the determination at can include all of the contacts in the first user s contact book and if the registration of is a later registration UE has the option of identifying a subset of its contacts as RCS contacts. For convenience of explanation assume that the RCS contacts in the first user s contact book map to UEs . . . each of which is operated by a different user from the first user. UEs . . . can each be associated with different users or alternatively two or more of UEs . . . may be associated with the same user from the first user s contact book e.g. UE may be a cell phone of a second user while UE may be an iPad of the second user where both cell phone and iPad contact information is stored for the second user in the contact book of the first user on UE .

At this point UE successively queries UEs . . . N for their respective RCS capability information. At UE transmits a SIP OPTIONS message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities to UE via the IMS network and UE responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities for UE . At UE transmits a SIP OPTIONS message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities to UE via the IMS network and UE responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities for UE . At UE transmits a SIP OPTIONS message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities to UE via the IMS network and UE responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities for UE . At UE transmits a SIP OPTIONS message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities to UE via the IMS network and UE responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities for UE .

The RCS capability discovery procedure shown in is described as triggered by RCS service registration at e.g. an initial user registration for RCS service or a new device registration for RCS service . However the RCS capability discovery procedure can also be triggered in other scenarios such as i when a new RCS contact is added to the first user s contact book on UE ii on a periodic basis to refresh the RCS capability information of the first user s RCS contacts on UE and or iii when details associated with one or more of the first user s RCS contacts are edited e.g. phone number SIP URI etc. .

Embodiments of the invention are directed to an RCS capability discovery procedure whereby RCS capability information for multiple target UEs is retrieved by a requesting UE from a single target UE. As will be described below in more detail by modifying the SIP OPTIONS and SIP 200 OK messages exchanged between two UEs engaged in an RCS capabilities exchange procedure RCS capability information for two or more UEs can be conveyed via a single SIP 200 OK message.

As shown in Table 2 above the particular RCS capability information and associated age or timestamp denoted T in Table 2 is provided with the timestamp T of each UE s own RCS capability information labeled as Current . The timestamp T can be indicative of the time at which the relevant UE transmitted the RCS capability information to some other UE either the UE that maintains the RCS capability information or some other intervening UE or an earlier point in time prior to the actual transmission when the RCS capability information was validated by the relevant UE.

Referring to assume that UE is associated with a first user. At some point after registering with the IMS network for RCS service UE determines to retrieve RCS capability information for two or more RCS contacts in the first user s contact book . The determination of can be triggered by i an initial user registration for RCS service ii a new device registration for RCS service iii a new RCS contact being added to the first user s contact book on UE iv reaching a next periodic interval at which refreshes of the RCS capability information of the first user s RCS contacts on UE are triggered and or iii edits to details associated with one or more of the first user s RCS contacts e.g. phone number SIP URI etc. .

As in the RCS contacts in the first user s contact book can correspond to all of the first user s contacts in the contact book or a subset thereof. In an example similar to of UE may determine to retrieve or refresh the RCS capability information for each of the RCS contacts in the first user s contact book at . Alternatively UE may determine to attempt to retrieve or refresh the RCS capability information for a subset e.g. less than all of the RCS contacts in the first user s contact book at . For convenience of explanation assume that the two or more RCS contacts for which an RCS capability information update is determined at map to UEs . . . each of which is operated by a different user from the first user. UEs . . . can each be associated with different users or alternatively two or more of UEs . . . may be associated with the same user from the first user s contact book e.g. UE may be a cell phone of a second user while UE may be an iPad of the second user where both cell phone and iPad contact information is stored for the second user in the contact book of the first user on UE .

After identifying UEs . . . as the RCS contacts for which to retrieve or update RCS capability information at UE can optionally evaluate the respective priorities of UEs . . . to determine an update order by which UE will attempt to retrieve RCS capability information therefrom . For example a first RCS contact corresponding to the first user s wife may be allocated a higher priority than a second RCS contact corresponding to the first user s co worker. Further multiple UEs can be associated with the same RCS contact and the different UEs associated with the same contact can also be allocated different priorities. For example a cell phone operated by the first user s wife may be allocated a higher priority than an iPad operated by the first user s wife because the first user s wife may be presumed to carry her cell phone with her at all times. Table 3 below illustrates an example set of priorities associated with UE for UEs . . . 

The priorities shown in Table 3 are determined based on a relationship status e.g. wife husband co worker family member friend with the first user that can be user specified or ascertained via a social network and can be used to infer the relative priorities of the UEs. However the priorities can be determined in a number of alternative ways aside from relationship status. For example the priorities of the UEs can be determined based on how frequently UE interacts with the other UEs e.g. higher interaction frequency can be associated with higher priority . In another example factors such as time of day and or location can be used to affect the priorities. For example if UE is operated by a friend of the first user who lives in San Diego detection of UE being located near San Diego can increase UE s priority because it is more likely that UE is going to try to contact UE when their respective users are near each other which can augment UE s priority while UE is local to UE . In another example if UE is operated by a co worker of UE UE s priority can be higher during normal work hours when communication between UE and UE is more likely as compared to at other times. The above noted priority factors can be used in isolation or in combination to arrive at the resultant priorities for the respective UEs for a particular RCS capability information discovery procedure. Thus the priorities are not necessarily static and can change based on circumstance.

Irrespective of whether UEs . . . are ranked by priority or are ordered by some type of default ordering mechanism assume that UE determines to send SIP OPTION messages to UEs . . . in order of UE then UE if necessary then UE if necessary then UE if necessary . At UE configures a SIP OPTIONS message for delivery to UE that not only indicates UE s RCS capability information but also identifies each of UEs . . . . The manner in which the SIP OPTIONS message is configured to identify UEs . . . can be implemented in a number of different ways. For example phone numbers and or SIP Uniform Resource Identifiers URIs for UEs . . . can be attached to the SIP OPTIONS message either in a new proprietary field or a field that is already defined by the RCS standard such as a SIP OPTIONS BLOB field. Alternatively instead of including the entire phone numbers and or URIs for UEs . . . UE can instead configure the SIP OPTIONS message to include a hash e.g. an MD5 hash of the phone numbers and or URIs.

After configuring the SIP OPTIONS message at UE transmits the configured SIP OPTIONS message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and also identifies UEs . . . to UE via the IMS network . UE receives the configured SIP OPTIONS message and generates a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capability information for UE . However in the embodiment of UE also compares the identification information for UEs and against UE s own contact book to determine if any matches occur. If there are one or more matches and UE maintains RCS capability information for the matching contact s UE adds the RCS capability information for the matching contact s into the SIP 200 OK message at . In this case as shown in Table 2 above the SIP OPTIONS message from identifies UEs and and UE maintains RCS capability information for UEs and so UE attaches the RCS capability information for UEs and to the SIP 200 OK message at . UE then transmits the configured SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities of UEs and to UE via the IMS network .

At this point assume that five seconds have passed from the RCS capability information state shown in Table 2 above such that the RCS capability information that is known to UE aside from its own RCS capability information is shown in Table 4 below as follows 

Based on the assumptions shown in Table 4 above UE has successfully acquired RCS capability information for UEs and from the SIP 200 OK message received from UE at . However UE did not provide the RCS capability information for UE . Also in the embodiment of assume that an RCS expiration threshold corresponds to 60 minutes such that any RCS capability information that is older than 60 minutes is deemed to have expired. With this assumption the RCS capability information for UE is expired because it is nearly two hours old when received by UE . The RCS expiration threshold can either be static e.g. 60 minutes etc. or can be dynamic based on priority or some other factor as will be described below with respect to the RCS capability information age threshold at of below. The RCS capability information age threshold described with respect to of below may thereby be the same or different from the RCS expiration threshold used to determine whether RCS capability information is expired by UE during the process of . At UE determines to continue the RCS capability discovery procedure by pinging UE because UE is the next UE after UE in the order determined at based on priority or based on some default ordering scheme .

At UE configures a SIP OPTIONS message for delivery to UE that not only indicates UE s RCS capability information but also identifies each of UEs and . As an alternative because UE s RCS capability information for UE is so recent UE can potentially be omitted from the SIP OPTIONS message at . Similar to the manner in which the SIP OPTIONS message is configured to identify UEs and can be implemented in a number of different ways e.g. attaching phone numbers and or URIs or a hash thereof of UEs and to a SIP OPTIONS BLOB field using a new proprietary field of the SIP OPTIONS message etc. 

After configuring the SIP OPTIONS message at UE transmits the configured SIP OPTIONS message that indicates UE s RCS capabilities and also identifies UEs and to UE via the IMS network . UE receives the configured SIP OPTIONS message and generates a SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capability information for UE . However in the embodiment of UE also compares the identification information for UEs and against UE s own contact book to determine if any matches occur. If there are one or more matches and UE maintains RCS capability information for the matching contact s UE adds the RCS capability information for the matching contact s into the SIP 200 OK message at . In this case as shown in Table 2 above the SIP OPTIONS message from identifies UEs and and UE maintains RCS capability information for UEs and so UE attaches the RCS capability information for UEs and to the SIP 200 OK message at . UE then transmits the configured SIP 200 OK message that indicates the RCS capabilities of UEs and to UE via the IMS network .

At this point assume that five more seconds have passed from the RCS capability information state shown in Table 4 above such that the RCS capability information that is known to UE aside from its own RCS capability information is shown in Table 5 below as follows 

Based on the assumptions shown in Table 5 above UE updates its RCS capability information state for UEs . . . . In particular as shown in Table 5 UE has successfully acquired RCS capability information for each of UEs . . . from the SIP 200 OK message received from UE at in combination with the SIP 200 OK message received from UE at . In particular for UE UE s RCS capability information state uses the RCS capability information reported by UE in the SIP 200 OK message at because it is more recent than the RCS capability information reported by UE for UE in the SIP OPTIONS message of . Further for UE UE s RCS capability information state uses the RCS capability information reported by UE in the SIP 200 OK message at because the RCS capability information reported by UE in the SIP OPTIONS message of did not include any RCS capability information for UE . Further for UE UE s RCS capability information state uses the RCS capability information reported by UE in the SIP 200 OK message at because it is more recent than the expired RCS capability information reported by UE for UE in the SIP OPTIONS message of . Further for UE UE s RCS capability information state uses the RCS capability information reported by UE in the SIP 200 OK message at because it is more recent than the RCS capability information reported by UE for UE in the SIP OPTIONS message of .

While not shown explicitly in one or more of the RCS contacts or UEs may place limits on whether their respective RCS capability information is permitted to be shared with third party UEs. For example a particular user may permit his her RCS capability information for one of his her device to be shared with close family members but not with friends or co workers. In this case UE may be required to obtain permission to add UE s RCS capability information to the SIP 200 OK message at for example. Such permission can be obtained in advance e.g. UE provides UE with an authorized buddy list of RCS contacts to which UE may provide UE s RCS capability information or in real time e.g. UE pings UE for permission to provide UE with UE s RCS capability information after the SIP OPTIONS message arrives from UE at . Alternatively UE can simply ask UE not to disclose its RCS capability information to any requesting entity. Thereby an authorization aspect can be made part of the process of in other embodiments of the invention that permits users to control which UEs gain access to their RCS capability information.

Further while not shown explicitly in if UE determines to contact less than all of its RCS contacts at UE still has the option of identifying its full list of RCS contacts in the SIP OPTIONS message at and or . For example assume that UE s contact book includes at least UEs . . . . In this example if UEs . . . are selected at based on UE having expired or non existent RCS capability information for UEs . . . and UE does not select UE at because UE s RCS capability information is still fresh UE has the option of including UE s identifying information in the SIP OPTIONS message at and or as a preemptive refresh mechanism for UE even though UE is not queued to receive an actual SIP OPTIONS message itself i.e. directly from UE during the process of . In other words UE will refresh UE s RCS capability information if possible but will not seek out UE directly as a target for a SIP OPTIONS message if the process of does not result in an RCS capability information refresh for UE .

Further while not shown explicitly in in another embodiment UE can configure SIP OPTIONS messages to include RCS capability information for one or more other UEs similar to the SIP 200 OK message. For instance the SIP 200 OK message received at includes RCS capability for UE UE expired and UE . Later in addition to requesting the RCS capability information for UEs . . . from UE via the SIP OPTIONS message of UE can also attach the RCS capability information that it already knows about to the SIP OPTIONS message of e.g. in the SIP OPTIONS BLOB field with the identifying information for UEs and within a new proprietary field etc. . UE can also optionally exclude the RCS capability information for UE due to its expiration. Thus the exchange of RCS capability information for multiple UEs as opposed to merely the transmitting UE can be carried over to the SIP OPTIONS message in addition to the SIP 200 OK message in another embodiment.

Referring to the given UE determines a priority level for the target UE . For example the priority level for the target UE can be determined as described above with respect to Table 3 e.g. the target UE can have a high priority if the target UE is operated by a co worker during work hours a wife of an operator of the given UE if the given UE and the target UE are nearby or have a history of communicating at a particular time block etc. . Based on the priority determined at the given UE identifies a priority specific RCS capability information age threshold . The RCS capability information age threshold determines how long the RCS capability information for the target UE is permitted to age before an RCS capability information refresh procedure for the target UE is triggered. As will be appreciated a higher priority for the target UE is associated with a shorter RCS capability information age threshold so that the RCS capability information for higher priority RCS contacts is maintained fresher than lower priority RCS contacts. For example if the target UE has a low priority the RCS capability information age threshold may be 90 minutes if the target UE has an intermediate priority the RCS capability information age threshold may be 60 minutes and if the target UE has a high priority the RCS capability information age threshold may be 30 minutes. As noted above the RCS capability information age threshold may be the same or different than the RCS expiration threshold described above with respect to .

At the given UE starts or resets a timer to track whether the RCS capability information is expired based on the RCS capability information age threshold identified at along with the timestamp for the RCS capability information obtained at . As noted above the age of the RCS capability information is derived from the time at which the RCS capability information was reported by the target UE itself and not necessarily by the time at which some intervening UE that conveyed the target UE s RCS capability information to the given UE. At before the timer expires the given UE determines whether fresher RCS capability information for the target UE has been received at the given UE . If so the process returns to and the timer is reset or extended based on the timestamp associated with the newly arriving RCS capability information. If not the given UE determines whether the timer is expired at . In particular expiration of the timer at is deemed to occur when the time between a current time and the timestamp of the most recent RCS capability information received at the given UE for the target UE exceeds the RCS capability information age threshold identified for the target UE at .

Referring to if the timer is determined not to have expired at the process returns to and continues to run. Otherwise if the timer expires at the given UE transmits a SIP OPTIONS message to the target UE that indicates the given UE s RCS capability information . The SIP OPTIONS message transmitted at can optionally be configured to further include identifiers for one or more other RCS contacts aside from the target UE so that the given UE can try to update the RCS capability information for the other RCS contacts as well similar to and or of . At the target UE responds to the SIP OPTIONS message from the given UE with a SIP 200 OK message that indicates at least the RCS capability information of the target UE and potentially the RCS capability information for one or more other RCS contacts that were identified in the SIP OPTIONS message e.g. if the target UE has access to such information and is authorized to provide it to the given UE . The given UE updates the RCS capability information and associated timestamp for the target UE . Also if the SIP 200 OK message included RCS capability information for other RCS contacts the given UE can update the RCS capability information and associated timestamp for the other RCS contacts as well . After the process returns to where the timer is reset or extended based on the timestamp associated with the newly arriving RCS capability information from the target UE. While is described above with respect to one particular target UE it will be appreciated that can execute in parallel for multiple target UEs such that the given UE can maintain the RCS capability information for each of its RCS contacts at a target level of freshness based on their respective priority levels.

While the embodiments are described above with respect to protocol specific signals such as SIP OPTIONS SIP 200 OK etc. it will be appreciated that embodiments can be extended to any peer to peer RCS capability acquisition protocol and is not limited to the particular protocol examples provided above.
