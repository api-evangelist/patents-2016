Over the past decade it has become clear that epigenetic changes which alter gene activity without altering DNA sequence collaborate with genetic mistakes to promote cancer development and progression Tsai H. C. and Baylin S. B. 2011 21 3 502 17 and Fullgrabe J. Kavanagh E. and Joseph B. 2011 . The regulation of the modifications on DNA and the proteins associated with DNA has become an area of intense interest and the enzymes involved in these processes have been suggested as a new class of protein targets for drug development. The major proteins associated with DNA are histone proteins. Histone tails are subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation acetylation methylation and ubiquitination and these modifications especially acetylation and methylation on lysine residues play a major role in the regulation of gene expression and are often dysregulated in cancer Fullgrabe J. Kavanagh E. and Joseph B. 2011 .

Recently an enzyme called Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 LSD1 was found to catalyze the oxidative demethylation of monomethylated and dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 4 H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 and lysine 9 H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 through a flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD dependent reaction Shi Y. et al. 2004 119 7 941 53 and Metzger E. et al. 2005 437 7057 436 9 Whereas histone acetylation is associated with loose chromatin and gene activation methylation of histones is less straightforward. Using the lysine residues regulated by LSD1 as an example methylation at H3K4 is generally associated with gene activation while methylation of H3K9 is associated with transcriptional repression.

There is currently one known mammalian homolog of LSD1 which is a protein variously designated LSD2 KDM1b and AOF1. It shares a similar domain homology but exhibits less than 31 sequence identity Fang R. et al. 2010 39 222 233 . It has been shown that LSD2 is a H3K4me1 2 demethylase that specifically regulates histone H3K4 methylation within intragenic regions of its target genes ibid. . Both LSD1 and LSD2 contain a SWIRM domain a FAD coenzyme binding motif and a C terminal amine oxidase domain all of which are critical to the enzymatic activity. However unlike LSD1 the protein LSD2 contains a CW type zinc finger domain in its N terminal domain a region which is unstructured in LSD1. Furthermore LSD2 lacks the tower domain of LSD1. At a cellular level it has been suggested that LSD2 has a role in transcriptional regulation ibid. . As expected LSD2 appears to play a role in regulating DNA methylation as well although the role in DNA methylation may be developmental stage specific ibid. Ciccone D. N. et al. 2009 461 415 418 Karytinos A. et al. 2009 284 17775 17782 and Yang Z. et al. 2010 20 276 287 .

Several lines of evidence point to LSD1 as being a possible therapeutic target in cancer. LSD1 is reportedly over expressed in a variety of tumors including neuroblastoma ER negative breast bladder lung and colorectal tumors Schulte J. H. et al. 2009 69 5 2065 71 Lim S. et al. 2010 31 3 512 20 and Hayami S. et al. 2011 128 3 574 86 . Increased methylation of the permissive H3K4 mark by LSD1 inhibition has been shown to reactivate expression of tumor suppressor genes in cancer models Huang Y. et al. 2009 15 23 7217 28 . In addition LSD1 has been found to associate with estrogen and androgen receptors leading to the specific demethylation of the repressive H3K9 mark thereby increasing target gene expression Metzger E. et al. 2005 437 7057 436 9 and Garcia Bassets I. et al. 2007 128 3 505 18 . Thus depending upon cofactors bound to LSD1 demethylation by LSD1 can contribute to cancer through both the permissive H3K4 and the repressive H3K9 mark. Therefore the inhibition of LSD1 might be an effective strategy for re expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes as well as down regulation of important cancer pathways in a number of cancer types. Several LSD1 inhibitors have been reported but they have shown poor selectivity and or pharmacological properties making further exploration of LSD1 biology difficult.

Monoamine oxidase MAO inhibitors such as tranylcypromine and pargyline have been reported as LSD1 inhibitors and there have been several reports regarding attempts to discover derivatives with increased selectivity for LSD1 over MAO Mimasu S. et al. 2010 49 30 6494 503 Binda C. et al. 2010 132 19 6827 33 Culhane J. C. et al. 2006 128 14 4536 7 Culhane J. C. et al. 2010 132 9 3164 76 and Ueda R. et al. 2009 131 48 17536 7 . These compounds irreversibly inactivate LSD1 by covalent binding to the FAD cofactor. Polyamine derivatives have also been evaluated as LSD1 inhibitors where compounds with activity in the M range have been described Huang Y. et al. 2009 15 23 7217 28 Sharma S. K. et al. 2010 53 14 5197 212 and Huang Y. et al. 2007 104 19 8023 8 . In general these and other reported LSD1 inhibitors are neither adequately selective nor potent enough to optimally interact with the crucial amino acid residues of the substrate binding site present in LSD1.

In summary the LSD proteins play a key role in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation and they are frequently altered in mammalian cancers thus making them an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Despite advances in drug discovery directed to identifying inhibitors of LSD1 and or LSD2 protein activity there is still a scarcity of compounds that are both potent efficacious and selective inhibitors of either LSD1 or LSD2. Furthermore there is a scarcity of compounds effective in the treatment of cancer and other diseases associated with dysfunction in LSD1 and or LSD2. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present invention.

The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder the specific composition employed the age body weight general health sex and diet of the patient the time of administration the route of administration the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed the duration of the treatment drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. In further various aspects a preparation can be administered in a prophylactically effective amount that is an amount effective for prevention of a disease or condition.

It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled.

Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms having the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these compounds called stereoisomers are identical except that they are non superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture.

Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk . When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas it is understood that both the R and S configurations of the chiral carbon and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge bonds to atoms above the plane and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is bonds to atoms below the plane . The Cahn Inglod Prelog system can be used to assign the R or S configuration to a chiral carbon.

Compounds described herein comprise atoms in both their natural isotopic abundance and in non natural abundance. The disclosed compounds can be isotopically labelled or isotopically substituted compounds identical to those described but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C N O O S F and Cl respectively. Compounds further comprise prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures below by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non isotopically labelled reagent.

Relative free energies of binding for comparisons between the two binding modes were predicted using MMPBSA.pywith 100 snapshots at 1 ps intervals starting either at 1 ps or 101 ps into the trajectory.

The first crystal structures of LSD1 elucidating critical architectural features were later by Stavropoulos et al. 2006 13 7 626 32 Protein Data Bank or PDB ID 2H94 see http www.wwpdb.org Yang et al. 2006 23 3 377 87 PDB ID 21W5 and Chen et al. 2006 103 38 13956 61 PDB ID 2HKO . These 2.9 2.57 and 2.8 structures respectively show a highly negatively charged substrate binding cavity spacious enough to accommodate the N terminal tail of histone H3. Further an N terminal SWIRM domain and an insertion in the core catalytic domain termed the Tower Domain were established as necessary structural motifs for enzymatic activity and interactions with cofactors such as CoREST. For the studies described herein the structure PDB ID 2Z5U was used with bound LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine for computational studies including virtual screening docking and molecular dynamics Mimasu S. et al. 2008 366 1 15 22 . In order to evaluate the chemical space outside of tranylcypromine and polyamine derivatives HTVS was used with an in house library. The library was curated from publicly available vendor libraries totaling approximately 13 million compounds using custom filters developed in house. Compounds were filtered based on Lipinski s rule of five with exceptions occurring in only 62 000 compounds. Further structurally redundant compounds were removed such that the resulting library contained a diverse yet manageable set of about 2 million compounds. Prior to screening compounds were prepared using the LigPrep module of the Schrodinger Suite as well as ICM s inbuilt preparation of three dimensional 3D ligands such that physiologically relevant protonation states were used.

Prepared ligands were then docked against three different sites on LSD1 the FAD site located in the amine oxidase domain and the adenine dinucleotide and flavin fragments of this pocket. The docking protocols used by both ICM and Glide were run with the FAD adenine dinucleotide flavin fragments and known LSD1 inhibitors to check for accuracy. In addition to the docking algorithm rankings visual inspection of the docking results was used to evaluate binding position suitable pose and orientation. Taken together the scoring functions from ICM and Glide were able to correctly identify known inhibitors within the top 2 of the decoy set used. GOLD was used to re score and the GOLD fitness function produced similar enrichments.

A virtual screen was set up against the FAD binding pocket of LSD1 using the established docking protocol and the 2 million compound database. The top 10 000 compounds were selected from both ICM and Glide scoring functions for further analysis. A few identical compounds were scored similarly between the two algorithms this redundancy was filtered out. Furthermore visual inspection was performed to filter out similar compounds and to increase the diversity of the final selection. Visual analysis also allowed identification of key interactions within the FAD binding pocked of LSD1. These include hydrogen bonding with Ser289 Arg310 and Arg316 van der Waals interactions with Val590 and Leu625 and interactions with Trp756. Moreover compounds with hydroxyl and hydrophobic electron withdrawing groups seemed to show increased enrichment in the initial docking results. The FAD binding pocket of LSD1 is a deep and narrow crevice in the interior of the protein and is surrounded by hydrophobic amino acid residues. Thus the hydrophobic character of the compounds may play an important role in the random walk of the compound into the active site.

Based on the selection criteria discussed above 121 structurally distinct compounds were procured and submitted for biochemical screening against LSD1. The biochemical assay as described in the experimental section measures HOproduced from the oxidative demethylation of a peptide substrate. From the 121 compounds a series of related compounds which showed potent activity in the biochemical assay were identified. Docking scores ranks and accompanying biochemical assay results for the series are presented in Tables 1 2 and 6 9.

Of the ten active compounds in Table 1 and associated tables providing biochemical and cellular data Tables 6 8 and 9 that were discovered using virtual screening methods e.g. compounds 1 2 4 and 5 showed similar binding modes within the FAD binding site of LSD1. Additionally the docking scores for compounds 1 2 4 and 5 correlated well with the observed biochemical activity. These results suggested that improved inhibitors targeted toward the adenine dinucleotide pocket in the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 were accessible.

The Glide scores are predictive and correlated well with compounds having p OH or m Cl aryl substitutions compounds 1 and 5 . It is clear from these studies that the hydrophobic electron withdrawing groups such as Cl are tolerated whereas small alkyl substituents such as methyl e.g. compound 8 or fused bicyclic containing compound 10 have lower activity. Introduction of any donating groups particularly the OCHfunctional group at the 2position lost activity due to lack of Gly314 H bonding interactions e.g. compound 6 . The lack of biochemical activity of compound 6 was highly predictive from docking scores where ICM and Glide provided 18.39 and 6.63 kcal mol energies respectively. In subsequent docking analysis additional benzohydrazine series of compounds were identified with hydrazine C methyl or aryl 4 substituted sulfone containing compounds as exemplified by the virtual hit compound 9 which exhibited potent LSD1 inhibition activity with an ICof 19 nM. The low docking score of compound 9 is primarily due to the shift in 2 OH aryl ring position. Compound 9 with a sulfone morpholine substituent was chosen as a backbone for further optimization due in part to its chemical stability.

The binding mode of compound 12 with the sulfone morpholine is depicted with the docking pose predicted from ICM in Figure 1. In this model the phenolic group fits well in the pocket composed of residues Ser289 Gly314 and Arg316. The central carbonyl group appears to be involved in strong H bonding interactions with Arg310 amino group and the morpholine oxygen shows H bonding interactions with Val590. These sets of hydrogen bonding interactions were also observed with Glide and GOLD docking experiments. The additional experiments showed the morpholine substituted aryl ring participating in Tr Tr interactions with Trp756 residue while the morpholine oxygen retained in H bonding with Val590.

Chemical optimization also focused on the design of compounds containing heteroaryl rings on either side of compound 12. Computational models using these results generated a variety of chemically plausible scaffolds from which a substituted pyridine was identified as being an appropriate moiety capable of interacting with Ser289 Gly314 and Arg316 surrounding residues and ideal properties. A representative is compound 24 which had potent LSD1 activity of 28 nM and also exhibited a similar binding mode to that of compound 12 see Figure 2 .

Many of the representative compounds contain a C alkyl hydrazine to increase metabolic stability of the series. However a bulkier group like the ethyl group of compound 21 isn t well accommodated by the binding pocket as illustrated in different biochemical activities of compounds 12 and 21. Aryl substitiution with methylsulfone compound 25 and substituted with a morpholine ring compound 12 increased biochemical efficacy by roughly an order of magnitude when compared to compound 11. Addition of only a morpholine ring maintains some biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 23. Replacing the sulfono morpholine with sulfono N dimethyl also maintained biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 18. Additionally replacement of the 2 OH group with a chloro was found not to be well accommodated and a significant drop in activity was demonstrated between compounds 12 and 16. Results with compound 24 suggest that using a substituted pyridine is accommodated by the enzyme but various other substitutions and heterocycles generally resulted in a drop in biochemical activity as illustrated in compounds 13 14 15 17 19 20 and 22.

Many of the representative compounds in Table 2 contained a C alkyl hydrazine to increase metabolic stability of the series. However a bulkier group e.g. the ethyl group of compound 21 is less well accommodated by the binding pocket as illustrated in the different biochemical activities of compounds 12 and 21. The aryl substitiution with methylsulfone e.g. compound 25 and substituted with a morpholine ring compound 12 increased biochemical efficacy by roughly an order of magnitude when compared to compound 11. Addition of a heterocycle e.g. a morpholine ring maintains biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 23. Replacing the sulfono morpholine with sulfono N dimethyl also maintained biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 18. Additionally replacement of the 2 OH group with a chloro was found not to be accommodated with a significant drop in activity between compounds 12 and 16. As discussed above compound 24 suggests that using a substituted pyridine is accommodated by the enzyme. Further analysis suggests that the hydroxyl of compound 12 is associated with increased biochemical activity e.g. when this substituent group is substituted with a chlorine compound 16 activity was decreased.

Molecular dynamice MD simulations were carried out using the two different docking poses of compound 12 to determine if there was a preference for one docking pose over another. These data can better inform which interactions play a role in the results obtained with the compounds synthesized. The docking results show the higher ranked pose with compound 12 bound into the dinucleotide binding pocket via direct H bond interactions with Ser289 or Arg316 via its hydroxyl moiety binding mode 1 see Figure 3 and Table 3 . However there is another pose favorably scored with the morpholine ring of compound 12 interacting with Ser289 and Arg316 binding mode 2 see Figure 3 and Table 3 .

MD using the AMBER suite was used to evaluate the energetics of binding for both predicted binding modes. Simulations for binding mode 1 showed 7 conjugated electron interactions between compound 12 and Arg 316 as well as potential for hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and Ser289. Analysis of binding mode 2 showed potential Tr interactions between compound 12 and Trp756 with more favorable hydrogen bonds with Arg310 and Arg316. Further binding mode 1 is predicted to have hydrogen bonding with Val590 while binding mode two has van der Waals interactions involving the chloro group. MMPBSA analysis of the final 100 ps of simulation showed that binding mode 2 was predicted to have a free energy of binding of 40.8 kcal mol which is nearly 20 kcal mol more favorable than 21.0 for binding mode 1. The first 100 ps of simulation likely reflect in part the equilibration of the complex such that the calculated free energies of binding are not as favorable. This finding contrasts with the rankings of the binding poses during the docking process. It is possible that this difference arises from differences in the protein structure during docking and MD with a rigid structure used to increase the speed of the docking protocol and a flexible structure used for MD.

LSD1 activity was determined using a LSD1 Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit Cayman Chemical Item Number 700120 purchased from Cayman Chemical Company Ann Arbor Mich. . Recombinant expressed in baculovirus infected BTI insect cells monoamine oxidase A and monoamine oxidase B Catalog No. M7316 and M7441 respectively were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co. LLC. St. Louis Mo. . MAO Glo Assay Kit was purchased from Promega Corporation Madison Wis. . ATPIite Luminescence Assay System e.g. Catalog No. V1401 was purchased from PerkinElmer Inc. Waltham Massachussetts .

Cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured according to the procedures provided. Cell lines used included those shown in Table 4 below. In addition to the supplements indicated in Table 4 media were also supplemented with 1 penicillin streptomycin 100 IU mL penicillin and 100 g mL streptomycin . Cells were cultured at 37 C. and 5 CO. ATCC is the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. .

The primary assay for compound inhibitory activity was the LSD1 Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit Cayman Chemical Company Ann Arbor Mich. Cayman Chemical Item Number 700120 . Briefly test compounds were diluted to 20 the desired test concentration in 100 DMSO and 2.5 L of the diluted drug sample was added to a black 384 well plate. The LSD1 enzyme stock was diluted 17 fold with assay buffer and 40 M of the diluted LSD1 enzyme was added to the appropriate wells. The reaction mixture comprised horseradish peroxidase dimethyl K4 peptide corresponding to the first 21 amino acids of the N terminal tail of histone H3 and 10 acetyl 3 7 dihydroxyphenoxazine was then added to wells. Generation of resorufin generated by reacting with HOproduced in the reaction was analyzed on an Envision microplate reader with an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 595 nm.

Inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity was carried used using the MAO Glo Assay Kit according to the manufacturer s suggested protocol. Briefly 6.25 L of test compound was added to each well of a 384 well plate. Enzyme either MAO A or B was added 12.5 L in 2 buffer containing 1 g protein and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes. Finally 6.25 L of 4 MAO substrate was added to each well. Following a one hour incubation 25 L of Luciferin detection reagent was added to each well and incubated for 20 minutes. Luminescence was then measured on an Envision microplate reader. Representative data used to determine ICfor inhibition of each MAO isoform is provided in Figure 4 and representative data for several compounds is summarized in Table 8 below.

Cell viability was determined using ATPlite Luminescence Assay System PerkinElmer Inc. Waltham Massachussetts using the various cell lines described above and in Table 4. Briefly cells were seeded in 96 well plates and then treated with different concentrations of inhibitor 0.1 final DMSO concentration . After 96 hours of incubation ATPlite detection reagent was added directly to the culture well. Luminescence was read 5 minutes later on an Envision microplate reader. Representative ICdata for inhibition of cell growth with various cell lines is provided below in Tables 6 7 and 9.

Briefly T 47D cells were seeded in 96 well plates and treated with concentrations of inhibitors as indicated. Cell lysates Reverse transcription and single color syber green realtime PCR was performed using the Cells to Ct kit Life Technologies . Transcript levels of heme oxygenase HMOX were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase HPRT and actin. The primers used in real time PCR are shown below in Table 5 and representative data for the effect of disclosed compounds on HMOX expression are provided in Tables 6 and 7.

ICvalues are determined using GraphPad Prism 5 software. The data were entered as an X Y plot into the software as percent inhibition for each concentration of the drug. The concentration values of the drug were log transformed and the nonlinear regression was carried out using the sigmoidal dose response variable slope option within the GraphPad software to model the data and calculate ICvalues. The ICvalues reported are the concentration of drug at which 50 inhibition was reached.

The ability of representative disclosed compounds to modulate various biochemical and cellular activities was determined using the assays described above. The results are shown in the tables below. The IC M for inhibition of either LSD1 activity or cell growth using T 47D cells is shown in Tables 6 and 7. In addition the effect of representative compounds on heme oxygenase HMOX expression is also shown in Tables 6 and 7. The ICfor inhibition of monoamine oxidases A MAO A and B MAO B by representative compounds compared to a control compound tranylcypromine is shown in Table 8. The effect of Compound No. 12 in reference to the compound number used in Table 7 or E N 1 5 chloro 2 hydroxyphenyl ethylidene 3 morpholinosulfonyl benzohydrazide on cell growth for various cell lines in shown in Table 9. If an ICor other assay result is indicated as n.d. it was not determined in the indicated assay.

Compound 12 was used to evaluate sensitivity in a panel of cancer cell lines Table 9 . Cell line sensitivity to compound 12 in this viability assay varied by one log with ICvalues around 300 nM to just under 3 M. For comparison among the representative compounds ICvalues were determined in T 47D cells see Tables 6 and 7 . With few exceptions it was observed that T 47D cells were sensitive to test compounds that were active in the LSD1 biochemical assay and were less sensitive to the compounds which showed less activity in the LSD1 assay.

In order to add an additional level of analsysis of LSD1 inhibition in cell culture by these compounds expression array experiments were performed to evaluate transcriptional changes induced by compound 12 data not shown . These data indicated that heme oxygenase 1 HMOX1 was one of the most consistently up regulated genes across multiple cell lines following treatment with this compound. As HMOX1 is known to be regulated by H3 methylation in the promoter Krieg A. J. et al. 2010 30 1 344 53 the effect of the test compounds on HMOX1 expression in T 47D cells was determined see Tables 6 and 7 . The data show that the representative compounds which are associated with upregulation of HMOX1 expression are also associated inhibitory activity in the LSD1 assay and the cell viability assay.

LSD1 has a high structural homology of to the monoamine oxidase family of enzymes 17.6 for both monoamine oxidase A and B MAO A and B respectively e.g. see Gooden D. M. et al. 2008 18 10 3047 51 . Selective activity of the representative compounds for LSD1 compared to either MAO A or MAO B is a desirable property for therapeutic compounds targeting LSD1. The specificity of compound 1 and compound 12 were tested in MAO biochemical assays described herein see Figure 3 for representative results which are summarized in Table 8 . In this assay the known MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine exhibited activity against both MAO A and B. In contrast compound 1 exhibited comparable activity to tranylcypromine against MAO B but showed no activity against MAO A. However compound 12 does not exhibit activity against either MAO enzyme 300 M . Compounds 18 and 24 were also tested and exhibited no activity against MAO A or B and the results are provided in Table 8. These results demonstrate that the representative compounds have specificity for LSD1 with significantly reduced effect on the MAO enzymes. It should be noted that both MAO A and B differ from LSD1 in that the FAD is covalently bound to the enzyme through a thioether linkage with Cys406 and Cys397 respectively Kearney E. B. et al. 1971 24 321 327 and Bach A. W. et al. 1988 85 4934 4938 .

The following examples of the in vivo effect of the disclosed compounds are prophetic. Generally agents which modulate the regulation of chromatin including histone demethylase inhibitors display efficacy in preclinical models of cancer. In vivo effects of the compounds described in the preceding examples are expected to be shown in various animal models of cancer known to the skilled person such as tumor xenograft models. These models are typically conducted in rodent most often in mouse but may be conducted in other animal species as is convenient to the study goals. Compounds products and compositions disclosed herein are expected to show in vivo effects in various animal models of cancer known to the skilled person such as mouse tumor xenograft models.

In vivo effects of compounds can be assessed with in a mouse tumor xenograft study one possible study protocol is described herein. Briefly cells 2 to 5 10in 100 mL culture media were implanted subcutaneously e.g. by subcutaneous injection in the right hind flank of athymic nu nu nude mice 5 to 6 weeks old 18 22 g . For test compounds of the present invention a typical cell line used for the tumor xenograft study would be AN3 CA or BT 20. Other suitable cell lines for these studies are BT 549 HCT 116 HER218 MCF7 MDA MB 231 MDA MB 235 MDA MB 435S MDA MB 468 PANC 1 PC 3 SK N MC T 47D and U 87 MG cells. The cells are cultured prior to harvesting for this protocol as described herein.

Following implantation the tumors are allowed to grow to about 100 mm typically about 6 18 days post implantation before the animals are randomized into treatment groups e.g. vehicle positive control and various dose levels of the test compound the number of animals per group is typically 8 12. Day 1 of study corresponds to the day that the animals receive their first dose. The efficacy of a test compound can be determined in studies of various lengths dependent upon the goals of the study. Typical study periods are for 14 21 and 28 days. The dosing frequency e.g. whether animals are dosed with test compound daily every other day every third day or other frequencies is determined for each study depending upon the toxicity and potency of the test compound. A typical study design would involve dosing daily M F with the test compound with recovery on the weekend. Throughout the study tumor volumes and body weights are measured twice a week. At the end of the study the animals are euthanized and the tumors harvested and frozen for further analysis. Alternatively tumors may be processed immediately for analysis e.g. fixed in buffered formalin paraffin embedded and sectioned for hematoxylin eosin staining and further immunohistochemical analysis for desired oncology markers.

For example compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate polymorph hydrate and the stereochemically isomeric form thereof are expected to show such in vivo effects.

Alternatively it can be desirable to assess the in vivo efficacy of the disclosed compounds in a tumor explant or tumor graft animal models e.g. see Rubio Viqueira B. et al. . 2006 12 4652 4661 Fiebig H. H. Maier A. and Burger A. M. . 2004 40 802 820 and DeRose Y. S. et al. Patient derived tumor grafts authentically reflect tumor pathology growth metastasis and disease outcomes. 2011 . in press . These models can provide higher quality information on in vivo effects of therapeutic compounds. It is believed tumor graft models are more authentic in vivo models of many types of cancer e.g. human breast cancer with which to examine the biology of tumors and how they metastasize. Engraftment of actual patient tumor tissues into immunodeficient mice termed tumor grafts provides improvement over implantation of cell lines in terms of phenocopying human tumors and predicting drug responses in patients Clarke R. 2009 11 Suppl 3 S22 Press J. Z. et al. 2008 110 56 264 Kim M. P. et al. 2009 4 670 1680 Daniel V. C. et al. 2009 69 3364 3373 and Ding L. et al. 2010 464 999 1005 .

Briefly tissue samples will be collected from informed consented patients at Huntsman Cancer Hospital University of Utah under an approved IRB protocol. Samples will be collected and de identified by the Huntsman Cancer Institute Tissue Resource and Application Core facility before being obtained for implantation. It is anticipated that all primary tumors will be from individuals that had not received chemotherapy prior to tissue collection and and all metastatic effusions will be from individuals that had been treated with chemotherapy hormone therapy and or radiation therapy. The University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee will review and approve all mouse experiments. It is anticipated that a minimum of three mice per experimental group will be used and only female mice will be used for studies involving breast cancer tumors. A single fragment of fresh or frozen tumor 8 mm3 or about 10cells in matrigel is implanted into cleared inguinal mammary fat pads of 3 4 week old female NOD SCID mice. At the same interscapular estrogen pellets are subcutaneously implanted in mice with ER tumors. Tumor growth is measured weekly using calipers. When tumors reach about 150 2 000 mm the mice are euthanized and tissue fragments are re transplanted into another cohort of mice frozen for later use and or analyzed for histology gene expression and DNA copy number. Tumor volumes are calculated using the formula 0.5 length width . For experiments to determine estrogen dependence ER tumors are implanted into mice as described above in the presence or absence of intrascapular estrogen pellets and with or without a concurrent surgical procedure to remove the ovaries which is performed according to standard methods.

Freshly harvested tumor tissues from patients or mice are cut into 8 mm3 pieces and stored in liquid nitrogen in a solution of 95 FBS and 5 DMSO for later implantation. Alternatively the tissue is digested with collagenase solution 1 mg ml collagenase Type IV Sigma in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2.5 FBS 10 mM HEPES 10 g mL penicillin streptomycin at 37 C. for 40 60 min while shaking at 250 rpm. Digested tissue is strained to remove debris and washed in human breast epithelial cell HBEC medium DMEM F 12 supplemented with 10 mM HEPES 5 FBS 1 mg mL BSA 0.5 g mL hydrocortisone 50 g mL Gentamycin 1 g mL ITS X100 three times. The pellet is resuspended in freezing medium 5 FBS and 10 DMSO in HBEC medium and stored in liquid nitrogen.
