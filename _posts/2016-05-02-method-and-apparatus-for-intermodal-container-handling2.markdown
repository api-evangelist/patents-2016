title: Method and apparatus for intermodal container handling
abstract: A rail-road intermodal freight system. In an embodiment, a conveyor system is provided for placing rail cars in a position for loading shipping containers thereon, while an over-the-road trailer is secured to the rail car. Rail cars have a frame with a front end and a rear end, and a bogie having at least four flanged rail wheels is pivotally mounted to the rear of the frame of the rail car. A method for unloading the rail cars includes lifting the front of the frame of the rail cars and pivoting the rail cars by an angle alpha from the track direction at an unloading area, and lowering the front end of the frame to the ground to allow truck access to trailers on the rail car. By utilizing the method, efficient loading and unloading of train involved in intermodal shipments may save considerable time, and thus reduce costs.

This application relates to a system for efficiently transferring containers including unloading containers from ships and placing the same on rail cars and to a system for unloading trailers from rail cars and to apparatus which may be employed to facilitate such transfers.

In the freight shipping business it is well known that in many situations the transfer of containers from ship to rail may involve extra manpower and lost time while containers are first transferred to highway trailers and thence to rail yards for organization reloading and connection of intercity trains. However loading of containers on to highway capable trailers and thence the loading of freight trailers on to rail cars or alternately unloading the trailer and thence loading containers on to rail cars is a rather labor intensive and time consuming activity. For example highway trailers are often driven alongside of ships to a position for receiving a container from the ship. Then the highway trailers may be moved to rail yard where a switch engine may be used to position rail cars to a loading platform accessible to tractors for the trucks and the highway trailers on which the container was placed. As a result the use of rail to road intermodal system methods have largely been limited to rather long distance freight hauls. However in an ever more competitive shipping cost environment there remains a need for improvements which would provide cost savings and in particular labor hour savings. More particularly on short or medium haul lengths say 200 to 400 miles the use of rail systems might completely avoid the need for long haul truck drivers for large numbers of tractor trailer combinations. Thus the provision and use of a new ship to rail to road intermodal system would be desirable. Thus it would be advantageous if novel cost effective methods were available along with novel apparatus for implementation of such methods for improving economics of ship to rail to road freight transfer.

The foregoing figures being merely exemplary contain various elements that may be present or omitted from apparatus that may be used to practice the methods taught herein. An attempt has been made to draw the figures in a way that illustrates at least those elements that are significant for an understanding of the apparatus and methods taught herein and for the alternate configurations thereof. However various other elements for conveyor systems and intermodal freight system components and methods of use thereof may be utilized within the teachings hereof and within the coverage of the claims set forth herein.

Unique equipment and methods for use of such equipment in ship to rail to road intermodal freight systems are set forth herein. Some of the equipment useful in carrying out the method s described herein was previously described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 800 452 B2 issued Aug. 12 2014 to David KUN and entitled Railroad Freight Car Loading or Unloading the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. The illustrations provided in this disclosure are directed at embodiments utilizing the most common trailer design seen in over the road applications in North America namely a semi trailer. By definition a semi trailer is a trailer without a front axle. In semi trailers a large proportion of the weight in the semi trailer is supported by an over the road tractor. Semi trailers are normally equipped with landing gear namely legs which can be lowered to support the semi trailer when it is detached from the over the road tractor. In many parts of the world an over the road tractor coupled to a semi trailer is known as a semi trailer truck or more commonly simply as a semi . However it should be understood that equipment and methods described herein may be applied to other types of trailers including those having a front axle and attachment tongue and hitch and thus the intermodal system design described herein should not be limited to semi trailers per se but should be understood to be useful in the quick loading and unloading of various over the road trailer designs.

Attention is directed to where a rail car for carriage of over the road trailers is depicted. As seen in a rail car riding on bogie and the pair of auxiliary flanged wheels is being pulled by conveyor hook along on a rail siding . Rail siding includes companion spaced apart rails A and B. A conveyor system having a drag chain with links with one or more drive wheels is provided with drag chain disposed between rails A and B. As also seen in rail car is shown carrying an over the road semi trailer . As further detailed in the rail car includes a bogie with a chassis operably supporting wheelsets including a pair of axles with each axle provided with a pair of flanged rail wheels . The bogie may be provided in any of a number of configurations known to those of skill in the art for example those which are disclosed at https en.wikipedia.org. wiki Bogie or at https en.wikipedia.org wiki List of railroad truck parts media File Railroad truck FM55 20.Fig8 8.png. In various configurations the bogie may be provided with a suspension package which may include conventional components such as springs to absorb the shocks between the bogie chassis or frame and the body of rail car . Springs may be located between a spring plank and a bolster not detailed in a conventional fashion as will be known to those of skill in the art and to whom this disclosure is directed. Plates including a center plate not detailed rotatably engage to allow the rail car to freely pivot on bogie around a center pivot pin which may pass through a center plate on the bolster .

As better seen in a frame is provided for rail car wherein the frame is generally L shaped with a frame front end and a frame rear end . The frame further includes a deck for support of a trailer . The deck may extend between a deck first end and a deck second end . In an embodiment a deck may be adapted to slope downward toward a second end during rail transit operation. In an embodiment a generally vertically extending bumper may be located at or adjacent the second end of the deck . A rear base may be provided located rearward of the bumper . In an embodiment a rear base may have a a lower side resting on and suspended by bogie as described above and b and an upper side . As seen in in an embodiment a conventional railroad front coupler and rear coupler may be provided. In various embodiments a hitch may be provided in order to secure a trailer to the rail car . Trailer in turn supports container .

As may be further understood with reference to and as described elsewhere herein in an embodiment a hitch may include a fifth wheel sliding plate with spring loaded clamping jaws that act on a king pin located at an upper mating plate on semi trailer all of which are adapted to lock the king pin to secure the semi trailer . As seen in a tractor adapted to pull trailer may be similarly equipped with fifth wheel type sliding plate and clamping jaws all provided in a conventional manner.

As seen in in various embodiments a rail car may be provided with one or more support members sized and shaped and joined with or integrally provided with frame so that the front end of rail car is supported. Such support members may extend forward of the frame with sufficient length LS sufficient to reach an upper side of a rear base of a next forward rail car in a set of N rail cars wherein N is a positive integer greater than one. As noted in at a first rail car the support members may rest on a connecting dolly which provides for attachment to engine . In an embodiment two support members may be provided.

As also seen in a deck may include a left track portion L and a right track portion R. The left L and right R track portions are sized and shaped for support of a trailer having conventional dual left wheels not shown and dual right wheels . The dual right wheels are seen in various figures. See for example for the dual right wheels the dual left wheels would appear substantially similar. As used herein dual wheels refers to the use of two wheels on one side of an axle and two wheels on the opposite side of the same axle for a total of four wheels on the single axle. However it should be understood that with respect to wheel width requirements on the frame use of a single outset wheel or a single inset wheel in lieu of dual wheels on a side of an axle should be considered functionally equivalent and within the scope of the term dual wheels as set out in herein. Further the tandem axle trailers illustrated herein have sets of dual wheels with one set of dual wheels on each side of each of the two axles.

As also may be appreciated from the left track portion L has a first inner edge and the right track portion has a second inner edge . The first inner edge and the second inner edge define a gap between the left track portion L and the right track portion R. In some embodiments a rail car may be further configured for transport of a semi trailer having landing gear. In such cases the first inner edge further comprises a first outwardly protruding cutout a distance D forward from the bumper that defines a narrowed length L of the left track portion L. Also the second inner edge further comprises a second outwardly protruding cutout a distance D forward from the bumper that defines a narrowed length L of the right track portion R. The first outwardly protruding cutout and the second outwardly protruding cutout may be sized and shaped to provide sufficient width W for passage through said deck of landing gear of a selected semi trailer. In an embodiment the rail car may be further provided with a first deck insert corresponding to the size and shape of the first outwardly protruding cutout and a second deck insert corresponding to the size and shape of said second outwardly protruding cutout . In an embodiment a first deck insert may be hinged to the left track portion not shown but similar to below and the said second deck insert may be hinged at hinge to the right track portion R.

Turning now to various aspects of components for an integrated ship to rail to road intermodal container loading apparatus are illustrated as well as various steps in implementing a method for their use. Rail car for carriage of over the road trailers is depicted being pulled along a railway by way of conveyor hook being pulled by drag chain of conveyor system . The over the road trailer is ready to receive a container as indicated in by way of removal of container A from ship by crane then by movement to location indicated by container B and thence by movement to the location indicated by container C. As further detailed in the rail car includes a bogie having axles connected to a pair of flanged main rail wheels located at or near the rear of the frame and a suspension package which may include conventional springs . As better seen in the flanged rail wheels are configured for transport over a conventional pair of first and second rails. A pair of flanged auxiliary rail wheels and are provided at a location forward of the flanged main rail wheels . Each of the pair of flanged auxiliary rail wheels and are disposed downwardly from the frame by opposing first gear leg strut and second gear leg strut . The opposing first gear leg strut and second gear leg strut are spaced apart by a cross brace . Rail car is provided with a conveyor hook . The conveyor hook extends below the frame . The conveyor hook includes an arm with a proximal end pivotally affixed to the frame at pivot . The conveyor hook arm has a downwardly extending hook which extends downward to a distal end thereof.

As seen in a conveyor system is provided as noted above having a drag chain with a plurality of chain links . Also see details in . Returning to at least one driving wheel is provided to drive the drag chain . The drag chain has upper portion oriented substantially collinear with a rail siding represented by rails A and B as detailed in and between the rails A and B in the pair of rails in the rail siding.

As seen in and noted above an over the road trailer is provided. The over the road trailer is sized shaped and configured for secure mounting engagement on and to the frame and to the hitch . In an embodiment the rail siding represented by rails and may be located at or adjacent a wharf which is configured to receive ship bearing shipping containers e.g. container A in . The rail siding represented by rails and is configured for movement of rail cars thereon.

A crane may be adjustably positionable on the wharf for removing shipping containers from a ship and placing them on the over the road trailer when the over the road trailer is mounted on the rail car .

As more clearly seen in in an embodiment the innovative system described herein may further include a pivot block and pivotally mounted thereto a pivot board . The pivot board may be preferably oriented collinear with and along and between the pair of rails and . The pivot board may have an upper surface adapted for sliding engagement with the cross brace .

Further in an embodiment a moveable pivot stop may be provided. The moveable pivot stop may be moveable between a pivot board engaging position see solid lines in and a pivot board avoidance position see broken lines in . The moveable pivot stop includes an upper end adapted to receive a lower side of the pivot board and thereby stop pivotal movement of the pivot board when the pivot stop is in the pivot board engaging position .

The moveable pivot stop may further include a pivot stop positioning element oriented to provide force for movement of pivot stop for example by use of hydraulic or electric drive. As illustrated in the pivot stop positioning element is adapted to move the pivot stop from a pivot board engaging position to a pivot board avoidance position .

As can be seen in the pivot board may be located at a height H above the pair of rails A and B wherein the height His sufficient to cause the pivot board to engage and upwardly urge the cross brace of the rail car as the rail car is advanced toward the pivot block by the conveyor system . Note that the moveable pivot stop is located to receive and stop pivotal motion of the pivot board and to thereby raise the conveyor hook sufficiently to thereby disengage the conveyor hook from the drag chain of the conveyor system so as to stop further movement of the rail car by way of the conveyor system . Also note that the flanged auxiliary rail wheels and are spaced a distance W below the frame i.e. from frame to rolling contact point so that the flanged auxiliary rail wheels and are raised above the pair of rails A and B when the cross brace is engaged by and moved upwardly by the pivot board until conveyer hook is disengaged from the drag chain. At this a downstream end of point pivot board moves downwardly a distance Huntil it comes to rest on the movable pivot stop . At this point a shipping container may be easily loaded on to trailer .

When loading of trailer is complete as can be appreciated from the moveable pivot stop may moved by the pivot stop positioning element . The pivot stop positioning element is adapted to move the pivot stop from a pivot board engaging position to a pivot board avoidance position . This movement releases the conveyor hook to reengage the drag chain and thus rail car is moved along away from first end and toward the second end of conveyor system .

The apparatus described above is expected to be useful in reducing the time and labor requirements for loading shipping containers on to trailers utilized in intermodal ship to rail to road shipments. First a plurality of rail cars are provided. Then a plurality of over the road trailers are provided. The over the road trailers are configured for receiving and securely transporting shipping containers . A first rail siding is provided located adjacent a source of shipping containers . In an embodiment a first rail siding may be located on a wharf and in such case the source of shipping containers may be a ship . The first rail siding includes a pair of rails A and B. An over the road trailer is affixed to a selected rail car . A conveyor system provided. Such conveyor system includes a first and a second end and a drag chain for moving rail cars from the first end to the second end . A selected rail car is moved to a loading position adjacent the source of shipping containers by engaging a conveyor hook on the rail car to the drag chain . When appropriately positioned the conveyor hook is disengaged from the drag chain to halt movement of the rail car . A selected shipping container A from the source of shipping containers is secured and lifted by a crane and then lowered and mounted to an over the road trailer on one of the plurality of rail cars . Subsequently the conveyor hook is reengaged with the drag chain to move the rail car to the second end of said conveyor system .

In an embodiment of the method as seen in at the end of the conveyor system a train assembly area is provided where a first one of a selected plurality of rail cars is connected to dolly . In a variation and refinement of the method the source of shipping containers may be organized by destination and in such cases shipping containers may be loaded to rail cars in groups by destination. In an embodiment a group of rail cars in a selected plurality of rail cars may be provided with a separate dolly for each destination to facilitate separation at distribution yards after transshipment on main railroad lines is complete.

In an embodiment the method may include the step of disengaging the conveyor hook from said drag chain by way of lifting a cross brace on a rail car sufficiently so as to disengage the conveyor hook from the drag chain . In such an embodiment during the step of mounting the selected shipping container to an over the road trailer on one of the plurality of rail cars the cross brace is supported a height above the pair of rails and sufficient to allow the drag chain to move without engaging the conveyor hook . In this situation the upward movement of the cross brace is provided by a pivot board and during the step of mounting the selected shipping container to an over the road trailer on one of the plurality of rail cars the cross brace is supported a height above the pair of rails and by a pivot stop as seen in .

After loading of the shipping container on the over the road trailer the pivot stop is moved so as to remove support for the cross brace to thereby allow the conveyor hook to reengage the drag chain .

Attention is directed to which shows yet further details for an embodiment of a rail siding as at a time during which rail cars in a railroad train are being turned for pickup of the over the road trailers by an over the road tractor for removal from the rail yard.

As seen in when a train including L car type rail cars arrives at its destination at an intermodal hub location the rail cars may be pivoted about bogie . In such embodiments the bogie may include a pivot pin as described above which allows rail car to be pivoted with respect the bogie which remains on rails and . Thus the rail car may be turned to an angle alpha with respect to the orientation of the rail siding .

The L car type rail cars described herein enable use of a method for rapid loading and unloading of trailers to or from rail cars . First a plurality of rail cars as described herein may be provided. Then a plurality of over the road trailers such as trailers are provided. A suitable rail siding must be provided in a rail yard for access by both incoming rail cars and by over the road tractors for hookup to individual trailers . As can be appreciated by reference to there must be space in rail yard for storage for the plurality of rail cars when the plurality of rail cars are turned to a spaced apart angled configuration by an angle alpha with each rail car spaced apart from adjacent rail cars . Importantly the storage space in rail yard should be accessible as a roadway by tractors . As seen in a lift may be provided. Lift may be of conventional fashion as used for lifting containers however lifting requirements in most instances may be considerably less so energy savings may be possible by using lifting mechanism such as a wheeled lifting device more closely matched with actual loads. In any event lift is used to lift at least one end of each of the rail cars one after the other. To start a first N 1 rail car is lifted at or near a front end to turn the rail car and place the rail car at a selected angle alpha away from a track and . Then the front end of the rail car is lowered to the ground so that the deck of the rail car is accessible to a tractor . Then the trailer is removed from the rail car using the tractor .
