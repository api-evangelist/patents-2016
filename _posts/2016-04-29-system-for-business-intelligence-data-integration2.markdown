In some embodiments of the invention clients or servers or both may make use of one or more specialized services or appliances that may be deployed locally or remotely across one or more networks . For example one or more databases may be used or referred to by one or more embodiments of the invention. It should be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art that databases may be arranged in a wide variety of architectures and using a wide variety of data access and manipulation means.

Moreover it should be appreciated that the term database as used herein may refer to a physical database machine a cluster of machines acting as a single database system or a logical database within an overall database management system. Unless a specific meaning is specified for a given use of the term database it should be construed to mean any of these senses of the word all of which are understood as a plain meaning of the term database by those having ordinary skill in the art.

Similarly most embodiments of the invention may make use of one or more security systems and configuration systems . Security and configuration management are common information technology IT and web functions and some amount of each are generally associated with any IT or web systems. It should be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art that any configuration or security subsystems known in the art now or in the future may be used in conjunction with embodiments of the invention without limitation unless a specific security or configuration system or approach is specifically required by the description of any specific embodiment.

In various embodiments functionality for implementing systems or methods of the present invention may be distributed among any number of client and or server components. For example various software modules may be implemented for performing various functions in connection with the present invention and such modules may be variously implemented to run on server and or client components.

A query transformation server removes the visualization data column from the SQL query formulated by the client and transmits the query with the modified SQL query wrapped in an XML wrapper to a business intelligence BI engine web service module The BI engine web service module may associate custom fields with object metadata in the database tables it maintains and send that information as part of the XML wrapped SQL response. The query transformation server receives the response unpacks the SQL in it including the custom metadata fields included by the BI engine web service module reattaches the visualization column and passes the data to the APIs of the BI integration system. These custom metadata fields may be used by a visualization platform for joining tables. For example 

Now visualization platform can join Table A and Table B automatically and allow visualization of data.

When a visualization platform sends a query for data or for metadata system may remove any custom fields translate the query as needed and then provide the query to the appropriate connected BI engine web service module . Translation may comprise identifying keywords or phrases within a query and for each identified keyword or phrase system checks the particular query syntax for a BI engine web service module . If necessary system applies a plurality of transformations to some or all keywords or phrases to translate them into appropriate syntax for use by BI engine web service module and then transmits the translated query for handling. It will be appreciated that a wide variety of keywords phrases syntax parameters and translation types may be possible according to a particular arrangement and that the specific syntax and capabilities of different BI engine web service modules and visualization platforms may vary greatly according to the embodiment.

When a BI engine web service module responds to a query system may then re attach custom fields to the data prior to transmitting the response to a visualization platform. As a part of this translation process the BI integration system may transform the query itself as needed to produce a query suitable for a BI engine web service module .

Additionally a single query may be broken down into smaller queries such as to turn a single query that returns a large data set into a number of queries that each return a subset of that data allowing queries to process more efficiently while remaining entirely transparent to a user. Generally this may be accomplished by determining an appropriate maximum query length for example the maximum number of rows supported by a particular BI engine web service module or the maximum that can be reasonably processed in an allotted time frame and then iterating over the query and reading rows into a second query stopping when the limit is reached. This process may be repeated beginning with the final row to pick up where it left off and prevent any rows from being skipped to divide a single large query into multiple smaller queries without data loss and each small query may then be provided to a BI engine web service module for handling. This process may also be used for load balancing to distribute processing across multiple appropriate BI engine web service modules when possible to speed up handling for large data operations. In this manner it can be appreciated that a two way translation and integration is accomplished where BI engine web service modules and visualization platforms operate natively and a BI integration system handles all custom data and operations to facilitate this integration with complete transparency to a user.

BI integration may also be used for BI reports presenting BI reports regardless of complexity as a simple table with columns. Reports with complex queries across multiple tables may be transformed into a virtual table for example utilizing SQL nested query and applications may then query against the virtual table normally. Columns may be intelligently mapped using aliases and a smart filter capability may be used to send the filter conditions provided by an application to the report filter. For getting a list of values for filters in the application the column may be mapped to a specific table and query only that specific table and not the entire report further optimizing the process.

The skilled person will be aware of a range of possible modifications of the various embodiments described above. Accordingly the present invention is defined by the claims and their equivalents.
