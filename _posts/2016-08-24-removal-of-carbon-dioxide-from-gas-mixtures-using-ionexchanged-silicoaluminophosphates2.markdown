title: Removal of carbon dioxide from gas mixtures using ion-exchanged silicoaluminophosphates
abstract: Na-SAPO-34 sorbents were ion-exchanged with several individual metal cations for COabsorption at different temperatures (273-348 K) and pressures (<1 atm). In general, the overall adsorption performance of the exchanged materials increased as follows: Ce<Ti<Mg<Ca<Ag<Na<Sr. The strontium exchanged materials excelled at low-pressure ranges, exhibiting very sharp isotherms slopes at all temperatures. The Sr species were responsible for the surface strong interaction and the cations were occupying exposed sites (SIIâ€²) in the materials Chabazite cages. All the sorbent materials exhibited higher affinity for COover the other gases tested (i.e., CH, H, Nand O) due to strong ion-quadrupole interactions. Sr-SAPO-34 sorbents are by far the best option for COremoval from CHmixtures, especially at low concentrations.

The claimed invention was made with U.S. Government support under grant number NNX08BA48A awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and grant number OIA 0701525 awarded by the National Science Foundation NSF . The government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to the selective removal of COfrom light gas mixtures. More specifically it relates to the use of ion exchanged M SAPO 34 materials for the adsorption of CO.

The selective removal of COfrom mixtures of gases is necessary to help addressing environmental and energy related problems respectively. For example it is well known that the efficient capture of COfrom industrial emissions will help to mitigate greenhouse effects. On the energy side a considerable part of the natural gas reserves in the US 17 is treated to remove high COconcentrations as the pipeline quality for COconcentration is less than 2 . This contaminant reduces the energy content of natural gas causing it to miss the pipeline quality requirement for minimum heating value 970 BTU ft . Amine absorption is the most widely used method today for the removal of COfrom CHstreams but this technique is highly complex and therefore costly.

Adsorption processes using microporous and mesoporous known together as nanoporous materials are promising methods for the removal of CO avoiding regeneration and corrosion problems resulting from traditional solvent absorption methods. A number of nanoporous materials have already shown potential for this specific gas separation due to their small pore sizes and their narrow pore size distribution. Many studies have tried to address the COseparation problem by using microporous materials such as 5A 13X and Clinoptilolite zeolites mesoporous silica material SBA 15 and carbon molecular sieves CMS respectively. For instance 5A type zeolites have been used for air purification applications such as in adsorption devices to remove excess carbon dioxide from breathing air in aerospace vehicles cabins. At a concentration of ca. 900 ppm CO the 5A zeolite adsorbed approximately 1.5 wt of the gas. It is important to point out that there have been also some efforts towards the development of membranes for COremoval. Tsapatsis and co workers incorporated herein by reference developed a silicalite 1 membrane supported on porous alumina disks that displayed some selectivity towards CO. The highly oriented membranes considerably improved the otherwise low selectivity exhibited by silicalite powders. Recently Falconer and co workers incorporated herein by reference reported the preparation of Na SAPO 34 membranes via in situ crystallization on alumina tubular and porous stainless steel supports. These membranes were used to separate COfrom CHand other gases achieving also good selectivities. Among all of these adsorbent alternatives SAPO 34 materials hold the most promise and therefore are the focus of this invention.

Silicoaluminophosphates SAPOs are crystalline nanoporous or microporous according to the IUPAC classification for pore diameters materials formed by silicon aluminum phosphorous and oxygen atoms in tetrahedral coordination. The atoms are arranged in an orderly fashion and form frameworks with a variety of geometries. SAPO 34 has the framework characteristics of natural zeolite Chabazite CHA as shown in . This molecular sieve includes 8 ring apertures 4 that permit access to a 3 D channel and barrel shaped cage system. Such geometry allows molecules with small kinetic diameters to easily diffuse through the crystal structure. SAPOs also have a framework with a net charge that varies depending upon how the silicon substitution into an aluminophosphate group is achieved. That is if silicon is substituted for aluminum phosphorous or both the resulting net charge will be 1 1 or 0 respectively. Studies have shown that usually the second and third substitution mechanisms are present during the crystallization process. Therefore the SAPOs framework requires the presence of counterbalance species such as cations and or anions. These ions affect the pore size and geometry causing potential blockage of certain molecules and limiting the diffusion of some species through the structure. In addition these extraframework species provide effective functionalization of the sorbent surface since they can induce specific sorbate to sorbent energy interactions. Several cation sites in Chabazite like materials have been identified as seen on . The principal cation positions are in the center of a hexagonal prism Site I in the center of the six ring window Site II in the cavity displaced from the six ring window Site II and near the center of the eight ring window Site III . Given the influence of cation sites in adsorption processes the specification will occasionally refer to these positions.

The nature of extra framework cationic species in SAPO 34 considerably affects the sorbent performance particularly the interaction with Nand CHgases. For instance isosteric heat of adsorption data showed that nitrogen molecule interaction with the sorbent increases according to the extra framework species as follows Mg

Hence it is necessary to find alternative methods that could achieve COseparation in a selective and effective way at ambient conditions.

The present invention focuses on the ion exchanged M SAPO 34 materials for the adsorption of COat temperatures and pressures that approach ambient conditions.

According to an aspect of the invention a Mn SAPO 34 material was prepared by ion exchanging Na SAPO 34 with Ag Ca2 Mg2 Sr2 Ce3 and Ti3 cations.

Na SAPO 34 according to the invention was prepared by hydrothermal crystallization of saturated gels containing a molecular structure directing agent SDA . Reactants used were aluminum isopropoxide Aldrich o phosphoric acid 85 wt Sigma Aldrich colloidal silica 30 wt SiO2 LUDOX AM 30 Sigma Aldrich sodium hydroxide Sigma tetraethylammonium hydroxide TEAOH Fluka and distilled deionized water. Several batches were prepared using saturated gels each with the following oxide molar composition formula 0.5 TEA 20 0.3Na2O3 1.3Al2O3 0.6SiO2 P2O5 60H2O. The mixture was heated to 473 K inside a sealed Teflon lined autoclave under autogenous pressure for approximately 8 days. The final product was then filtered and washed with copious amounts of deionized distilled water. The resulting solid was dried at 373 K for 24 hours in a forced convection oven. The TEAOH was removed from the porous material framework by calcination methods using flowing air in a computer controlled muffle furnace. Using a ramp procedure at a heating rate of 10 K min the sample was heated to three consecutive temperature set points 1 hour at 373 K 1 hour at 473 K and finally 15 hours at 773 K. It should be mentioned that better porosity and crystal quality were obtained when the samples were pretreated in vacuum for 24 hours at 673 K.

Mn SAPO 34 samples were prepared by ion exchanging Na SAPO 34 with Ag Ca2 Mg2 Sr2 Ce3 and Ti3 cations respectively.

Equilibrium isotherm and diffusion adsorption data were obtained using two static low pressure volumetric adsorption systems Micromeritics ASAP 2020 outfitted with turbo molecular drag pumps. Adsorbate gases used were H2 Ultra High Purity Grade Linde O2 Ultra High Purity Grade Linde CO2 Ultra High Purity Grade Praxair and He High Purity Grade Linde . The latter was used as a backfill gas after the sorbent activation. The inert gas was removed via ultra high vacuum prior to adsorption tests. All SAPO samples were pre treated in vacuum at 648 K to remove water molecules strongly bound inside the structure. The temperature ramp evacuation rate and vacuum set used were 10 K min 50 mmHg s and 20 mHg respectively. Carbon dioxide equilibrium and uptake tests were performed at temperatures ranging from 273 to 348 K and pressures up to 1 atm. Tests for H2 and O2 were performed only at 298 K. During the experiments the temperature was kept constant by means of either a water bath or a heating blanket. It should be mentioned that the kinetic data were corrected to compensate for the equipment effective dead time 0.3 seconds and for any instability caused by the system. The equipment collection data step was set to 0.1 seconds.

Equilibrium adsorption data for the Mn SAPO 34 sorbents were fitted using the Sips Equation Langmuir Freundlich 

In this equation nis the system heterogeneity parameter which is usually greater than unity. The larger the parameter the more heterogeneous is the system. A justification for the use of this pure component adsorption isotherm model will be explained later.

The isosteric heats of adsorption were estimated using the Clausius Clapeyron equation and pure component equilibrium adsorption data at different temperatures and constant surface loading. The isosteric heat of adsorption H is given by 

The isothermal VPSA model used in this study consisted of a simple cyclic batch separation process with consecutive adsorption steps at 1 atm. Test were performed until achieving desired product purity e.g. 99.9999 CH4 . The pressurization step assumed no mass transfer between the gas and solid phases which is also known as the frozen column state. Inter crystalline diffusion resistance was also assumed to be negligible when compared to the resistance offered by the micropores of the sorbent. The equilibrium data for multicomponent adsorption was estimated using the extended Langmuir Freundlich isotherm model also known as the loading ratio correlation LRC . The linear driving force LDF model was used to describe the mass transfer involved in the various steps of the cycle. Diffusion time constants at zero coverage were estimated by fitting experimental data with the solution of the fractional uptake phenomenological model for spherical particles. The diffusion time constant were corrected for concentration dependence using the Cheng and Yang s model which is used for diffusion in zeolites where the molecules dimensions come close to that of the channel opening. Based on all of the above assumptions the model equations for the VPSA processes are summarized in Table 1. The resulting differential equations were solved using a variable order solver based on the numerical differentiation formulas NDFs or by the implicit finite difference using an explicit Runge Kutta method. t 

A combination of textural properties such as pore volume and pore blocking and the interactions energies will have considerable influence in the uptake of the sorbates depending on the cationic species. A complete description of the cation species surface area pore volume and unit cell composition of all the studied sorbents after the ion exchanged was previously described by Rivera Ramos and Hernandez Maldonado incorporated herein by reference . shows data for carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption for all the SAPO 34 sorbent materials at different temperatures 273 298 323 and 348 K . All the sorbents displayed the classic physisorption profile where an increase in temperature results in a decrease in uptake amounts at any given pressure. However some of the COadsorption isotherms exhibited a considerable non linear behavior and therefore did not follow the traditional pore filling mechanism. Different models were evaluated to fit the data i.e. Sips and Toth . The Sips equation showed better data adjustment and was therefore used for all sorbents cases for consistency.

Affinity constants for COisotherms were calculated using a qsat value obtained at 273 K. The advantage of using lower temperatures to estimate this value is appropriate since sorbate sorbate interactions become negligible. The qsat estimated from the Na SAPO 34 COisotherm data is 5.26 mmol g. It is important to point out that this value matches well with the one obtained by Falconer and co workers 5.0 mmol g using a similar approach incorporated herein by reference .

Table 2 summarizes the heterogeneity factor results for all the sorbents at different temperatures. In general the heterogeneity of the system with respect to carbon dioxide uptake changed as a function of temperature. This should be expected in nanoporous materials frameworks that usually have more sites i.e. coordination states available for the charge balancing cations to occupy as seen on . The distribution of cationic species on the sites depends on the temperature of heat treatment the nature of the species and the degree of hydration.

It is important to note that all the sorbents exhibited fully reversible adsorption desorption paths. This is critical for regeneration cycles since all the working sorption capacity could be regained by simple engineering means.

Usually an increase in cation size of monovalent species results in a decrease of the adsorption capacity in some zeolites. In terms of sorption characteristics at 273 and 298 K the COadsorption amounts in the Ag I exchanged materials are comparable to those obtained for Na SAPO 34. However as the process temperature is increased a decrease in the adsorbed amount was observed when compared also to the Na sorbent at the same conditions as shown in . Sorbents with certain transition metal cations are known to form complexation bonds with some sorbates e.g. N CO . But the carbon dioxide monodentate adsorption mechanism will probably avoid this kind of complexation resulting in a decrease in interaction with the sorbate at low pressure ranges when compared with other sorbent that exhibit the same adsorption capacity at higher pressures.

With the exception of the 273 K test results this material adsorbed less carbon dioxide at 1 atm when compared to the unmodified material. Based on the observed behavior it is plausible to state that Mg cations offer partial blocking of the pore window affecting the entrance of the sorbate molecules into the crystal framework. It should be mentioned that at 273 K this material produced an adsorbed amount at 1 atm comparable to that of the Sr SAPO 34 sorbent. The COadsorption in strontium exchanged materials will be discussed shortly.

At 273 K this sorbent adsorbed more carbon dioxide than Na and Ag SAPO 34 materials respectively. At 298 and 323 K the adsorbed amounts 1 atm are only comparable to those obtained with Sr SAPO 34 as shown in . The Ca SAPO 34 material also showed heterogeneity factors comparable to those obtained for Mg SAPO 34. With this behavior trend it could be stated that Mg and Ca cations occupied similar sites SII as seen on within the Chabazite framework.

The shape of the adsorption isotherms in this material is sound evidence of stronger sorbent sorbate interactions. Particularly when compared to the other M SAPO 34 formulations at the low pressure range as shown in . For this sorbent the results suggest that Sr cations are sitting near window sites site II producing strong interactions with the sorbates located within the relevant perimeter. With the exception of the 273 K test results this material adsorbed less carbon dioxide at 1 atm when compared to Na SAPO 34. It could be stated that at 273 K divalent cations are more exposed to interactions with the sorbate. As seen in at 298 K and a partial pressure of ca. 10atm or 900 ppm the Sr SAPO 34 sorbent adsorbs approximately 0.65 mmoles of COper gram of material. This translates to a sorption capacity of about 2.8 wt which is almost twice the observed capacity in 5A type zeolites at similar conditions. The strong interactions presented by this material towards COare without a doubt ideal for adsorption applications where traces of carbon dioxide are needed to be removed from a gas mixture i.e. ultra purification . The Sr SAPO 34 sorption performance will be discussed later.

For these sorbents the COadsorption capacities were much lower than those obtained with the other M SAPO 34 as seen on . It could be stated that both Ce and Ti species occupy sites near the center of the cages SIII where they can balance three Al tetrahedra negative charges on the framework at the same time. This coordination condition together with the considerable relative large size of the trivalent cations should result in some level of pore blocking.

Estimates of isosteric heat of adsorption for all M SAPO 34 materials correlated to physical and reversible adsorption as shown in . The values varied according to the type of cation exchanged into the SAPO 34 framework and the average was around 30 kJ mol. It should be mentioned that heats observed for Na SAPO 34 sorbents are in good agreement with calorimetric data previously reported by Gorte and co workers incorporated herein by reference for the adsorption of COin NaX zeolite. In addition many of the adsorbents displayed little degree of heterogeneity which correlates well with the results shown in Table 2. The only exception was the Sr II exchanged material.

It can be seen from that the Sr SAPO 34 sorbents have higher interactions with COwhen compared to the other M SAPO 34 materials. The variation of the isosteric heats as a function of adsorption loading was also very notable for this sorbent as shown in . This is in good agreement with the heterogeneity factors largest nfactor estimated for this material as shown in Table 2 above. Noting that the maximum heat of adsorption occurs at 0.65 mmol g as seen on and taking into consideration that the sorbent unit cell composition is given by NaSrH SiAlPO as previously reported by the inventors then there are one COmolecule adsorbed per Sr cation at this point. The adsorption heat maximum observed for the Srsorbent should be a result of the quadrupole moment interaction between the sorbate and the electric field generated by the cations on the SAPO 34 surface. Thus it can be said that once the carbon dioxide molecules have interacted with all the available Sr cations the sorbate continues to interact with the Na cations that are still present in the material. This corresponds to the subsequent energy decrease at higher loadings as seen on . The average isosteric heat of adsorption in the 1 2 mmol g loading region matches well with those observed for Nat SAPO 34. Additional deviations in the heat of adsorption are probably due to sorbate sorbate interactions within the cages of the structure.

The Sr SAPO 34 sorption capacity could be further improved if additional extraframework Sr cations are introduced. As previously mentioned the observed unit cell composition shows that Nacations are still present in the structure.

Although typical natural gas mixtures consist mainly of CH these also include significant quantities of CO Nand traces of Oand H. The portion of impurities gases is usually less than 5 percent of the total but there are some reservoirs where the share can be much larger. The adsorption behavior of all of these sorbates in the studied sorbents was analyzed to determine the potential of the M SAPO 34 sorbents for natural gas purification. show the pure component adsorption isotherms for all of the aforementioned gases in Na SAPO 34 Ag SAPO 34 and Sr SAPO 34 respectively. In general the sorbents displayed a remarkable selectivity towards COat all partial pressures. This invention focuses on the contributions to the surface potential or adsorption energy to explain the observed selectivity behavior.

The shape of the isotherms is an immediate reflection of the sorbate sorbent interactions or the heat of adsorption. For physisorption level interactions the heat of adsorption can be related to several components. These include dispersion and repulsion energies nonspecific and additional components attributed to electrostatic interactions specific . Nonspecific interactions and strongly depend on the polarizability . Although the sorbates magnetic susceptibility also affects these interactions the contribution is not as strong as the one provided by the polarizability. For the nonspecific interaction the following dependence holds 

Specific contributions and arise from charges on the solid surface. However since CO CHand Ndo not have a permanent dipole 0. For the remaining specific interactions the following dependence holds 

The following paragraphs will explain the potential of the sorbents to achieve the desire separation of a binary system using a rather simple transient simulation method. Since obtaining empirical data on multi component adsorption is beyond the scope of this invention a simple mathematical modeling approach for the CO CHseparation was carried out for the most promising studied sorbents Ag SAPO 34 Na SAPO 34 and Sr SAPO 34 .

The diffusion time constants at near zero coverage and the isotherm parameters values used for the simulation are summarized in Table 3 above and Table 4 respectively. VPSA cycle parameters are shown in Table 5. The calculations involving the Sr SAPO 34 sorbent were carried out using a Runge Kutta routine due to the strong non linearity that produces the observed heterogeneity factor. The NDFs method was used instead for the Na SAPO 34 and Ag SAPO 34 cases. Table 6 shows a summary of the simulation results. In general the results are in good agreement with the pure component adsorption isotherm data behavior previously described. Sr SAPO 34 required the smaller number of steps to obtain the achieve product purity and presented an acceptable adsorbed phase ratio. The sorbents exhibiting lower COinteractions at low pressures i.e. Na SAPO 34 and Ag SAPO 34 required additional VPSA step to achieve the required product purity. Based on these results all the materials are certainly capable sorbents for this kind of separation. However Sr SAPO 34 showed the strongest COsorbate sorbent interactions.

The present invention has shown that ion exchanged M SAPO 34 materials are promising sorbents for the selective removal of COat temperatures and pressures that approach ambient conditions. In terms of overall adsorption performance the exchanged materials exhibited the following trend Ce

In order to maximize the SAPO framework surface area the hydrothermal synthesis was performed under vigorous mixing. In addition longer aging times were employed prior to final mixing of the source materials.

The exchange procedure was optimized to increase the metal cation concentration gradient and therefore an increase in diffusion flux towards the solid phase. This strategy was aimed at achieving the highest exchange possible. The process temperature was fixed at 60 C. and the solid was recovered via mild vacuum filtration after 24 hours.

Exchange of Na present in the asynthesized porous framework with Sr. The solubility of the salt SrCl.6HO in water is ca. 1062 g L HO at 20 C. An undersaturated solution was obtained using a following salt to water weight ratio of 2.4 g 50 g which corresponds to a 4 fold excess amount 5.2

Exchange of Na present in the asynthesized porous framework with Ba. The solubility of the salt BaCl in water is ca. 375 g L HO at RT. An undersaturated solution was obtained using a following salt to water weight ratio of 4 g 500 g 5.3

Consecutive exchanges up to 3 were employed to approach the 100 cation replacement mark. All the steps were performed at 60 C. and for 24 hours. Recovery of the solids between exchanges was achieved through mid vacuum filtration and drying at 90 C. in a forced convection oven for 24 hours.

Tests for carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption in barium exchanged SAPO 34 powder indicate that it is possible to reach the low pressure sorption capacities exhibited by the strontium based material counterpart by means of a multiple stage ion exchange strategy as shown in . Sorbents that are sequentially exchanged with barium cations show an increase in COsorption capacity at partial pressures below 0.1 atm. Such behavior evidences incorporation of barium cations in exposed adsorption sites. At higher pressures however all the barium based sorbents exhibit a considerable decrease in adsorption capacity perhaps due to the large cation size. The latter should produce an effective reduction in pore volume and hence sorption capacity at pressures near 1 atm.

The sorbents were tested for adsorption reversibility by means of volumetric techniques. After in situ activation of the sorbents CO2 was allowed to adsorb in the porous materials at the different pressure increments at equilibrium. After achieving the instrument maximum pressure i.e. 1 atm the system pressure was reduced in small intervals and the CO2 desorption amounts registered.
