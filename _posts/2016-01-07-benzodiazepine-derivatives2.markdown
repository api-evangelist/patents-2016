The term compound or cytotoxic compound or cytotoxic agent as used herein is intended to include compounds for which a structure or formula or any derivative thereof has been disclosed in the present invention or a structure or formula or any derivative thereof that has been incorporated by reference. The term also includes stereoisomers geometric isomers tautomers solvates metabolites salts e.g. pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs and prodrug salts of a compound of all the formulae disclosed in the present invention. The term also includes any solvates hydrates and polymorphs of any of the foregoing. The specific recitation of stereoisomers geometric isomers tautomers solvates metabolites salt prodrug prodrug salt conjugates conjugates salt solvate hydrate or polymorph in certain aspects of the invention described in this application shall not be interpreted as an intended omission of these forms in other aspects of the invention where the term compound is used without recitation of these other forms.

The term conjugate as used herein refers to a compound or a derivative thereof that is linked to a cell binding agent and is defined by a generic formula C L CBA wherein C compound L linker and CBA cell binding agent.

The term llnkable to a cell binding agent as used herein referes to the novel benzodiazepine compounds e.g. indolinobenzodiazepine or oxazolidinobenzodiazepine derivates thereof or dimers thereof comprising at least one linking group or a precursor thereof suitable to bond these compounds derivatives thereof or dimers thereof to a cell binding agent.

The term precursor of a given group refers to any group which may lead to that group by any deprotection a chemical modification or a coupling reaction.

The term linked to a cell binding agent refers to a conjugate molecule comprising at least one the novel benzodiazepine compounds e.g. indolinobenzodiazepine or oxazolidinobenzodiazepine derivates thereof or dimers thereof bound to a cell binding agent via a suitable linking group or a precursor thereof.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomer refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution and connectivity but different orientations of their atoms in space that cannot be interconverted by rotation about single bonds.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as crystallization electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. McGraw Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons. Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and I or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

A substituent is substitutable if it comprises at least one carbon sulfur oxygen or nitrogen atom that is bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms. Thus for example hydrogen halogen and cyano do not fall within this definition.

If a substituent is described as being substituted a non hydrogen substituent is in the place of a hydrogen substituent on a carbon oxygen sulfur or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus for example a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent wherein at least one non hydrogen substituent is in the place of a hydrogen substituent on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro substituent and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro substituents. It should be recognized that if there is more than one substitution on a substituent each non hydrogen substituent may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted the substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted. If a carbon of a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with one or more of a list of substituents one or more of the hydrogens on the carbon to the extent there are any may separately and or together be replaced with an independently selected optional substituent. If a nitrogen of a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with one or more of a list of substituents one or more of the hydrogens on the nitrogen to the extent there are any may each be replaced with an independently selected optional substituent. One exemplary substituent may be depicted as NR R wherein R and R together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached may form a heterocyclic ring. The heterocyclic ring formed from R and R together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached may be partially or fully saturated. In one embodiment the heterocyclic ring consists of 3 to 7 atoms. In another embodiment the heterocyclic ring is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolyl imidazolyl pyrazolyl triazolyl tetrazolyl isoxazolyl pyridyl and thiazolyl.

If a group of substituents are collectively described as being optionally substituted by one or more of a list of substituents the group may include 1 unsubstitutable substituents 2 substitutable substituents that are not substituted by the optional substituents and or 3 substitutable substituents that are substituted by one or more of the optional substituents.

If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen substituents that substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen substituents or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent whichever is less. Thus for example if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen substituents then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen substituents as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. Such substituents in non limiting examples can be selected from a linear branched or cyclic alkyl alkenyl or alkynyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms halogen guanidinium NH C NH NH OR NRR NO NRCOR SR10 a sulfoxide represented by SOR a sulfone represented by SOR a sulfite SO a bisulfite OSO a sulfonamide represented by SONRR cyano an azido COR OCORor OCONRRwherein R R R R Rand Rare each independently selected from H linear branched or cyclic alkyl alkenyl or alkynyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms a polyethylene glycol unit OCHCH wherein n is an integer from 1 to 2000 aryl having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms heterocyclic ring having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate mesylate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts alkali metal e.g. sodium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal e.g. magnesium salts and ammonium salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counter ion.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of the cytotoxic compounds e.g. indolinobenzodiazepine or oxazolidinobenzodiazepine derivatives thereof dimers thereof or conjugates thereof of the present invention can be evaluated for their ability to suppress proliferation of various cancerous cell lines in vitro Tables 1 2 in . For example cell lines such as the human breast carcinoma line SK Br 3 or the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB can be used for the assessment of cytotoxicity of these new compounds. Cells to be evaluated can be exposed to the compounds for 72 hours and the surviving fractions of cells measured in direct assays by known methods. ICvalues can then be calculated from the results of the assays.

Examples of in vitro cytotoxicity of compounds of the present invention that were tested on a panel of cancer cell lines and their data is shown in Table 1. All the indolinobenzodiazepine dimer compounds tested were highly potent with ICvalues in the low picomolar range. IGN 09 retained most of its potency on multi drug resistant cell lines such as COL0205 MDR only 4 fold higher ICthan COLO0205 . Compounds of the invention are 1000 to 10 000 fold more cytotoxic than other DNA interacting drugs used in cancer treatment such as doxorubicin melphalan and cis platin. In a direct comparison the potency of the non linker bearing compounds IGN1 compound 18 and IGN09 compound 15 was compared to the linker bearing compounds IGN03 compound 34 and IGN05 compound 36 was tested towards a representative cell line Ramos. As shown in Table2 all four compounds are highly potent with ICvalues less than 1 picomolar demonstrating that the incorporation of linker does not affect potency.

The effectiveness of the compounds e.g. indolinobenzodiazepine or oxazolidinobenzodiazepine derivatives thereof dimers thereof or conjugates thereof of the invention as therapeutic agents depends on the careful selection of an appropriate cell binding agent. Cell binding agents may be of any kind presently known or that become known and includes peptides and non peptides. Generally these can be antibodies especially monoclonal antibodies lymphokines hormones growth factors vitamins nutrient transport molecules such as transferrin or any other cell binding molecule or substance.

fragments of antibodies such as Fab Fab and F ab Fv Parham 131 2895 2902 1983 Spring et al. 113 470 478 1974 Nisonoff et al. 89 230 244 1960

Monoclonal antibody techniques allow for the production of extremely specific cell binding agents in the form of specific monoclonal antibodies. Particularly well known in the art are techniques for creating monoclonal antibodies produced by immunizing mice rats hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell antigens isolated from the target cell whole virus attenuated whole virus and viral proteins such as viral coat proteins. Sensitized human cells can also be used. Another method of creating monoclonal antibodies is the use of phage libraries of scFv single chain variable region specifically human scFv see e.g. Griffiths et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 885 793 and 5 969 108 McCafferty et al. WO 92 01047 Liming et al. WO 99 06587 . In addition resurfaced antibodies disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 641 may also be used as may chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies. Selection of the appropriate cell binding agent is a matter of choice that depends upon the particular cell population that is to be targeted but in general human monoclonal antibodies are preferred if an appropriate one is available.

For example the monoclonal antibody MY9 is a murine IgGantibody that binds specifically to the CD33 Antigen J. D. Griffin et al 8 Leukemia Res. 521 1984 and can be used if the target cells express CD33 as in the disease of acute myelogenous leukemia AML . Similarly the monoclonal antibody anti B4 is a murine IgG that binds to the CD19 antigen on B cells Nadler et al 131 J. Immunol. 244 250 1983 and can be used if the target cells are B cells or diseased cells that express this antigen such as in non Hodgkin s lymphoma or chronic lymphoblastic leukemia HuB4 is a resurfaced antibody derived from the murine anti B4 antibody Roguska et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91 pg 969 973 . HuN901 is a humanized antibody that binds to the CD56 antigen expressed on small cell lung cancer multiple myeloma ovarian cancer and other solid tumors including neuroendocrine cancers Roguska et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91 pg 969 973 . B38.1 is a chimeric antibody targeting EpCAM. Fully human antibodies such as panitumumab targeting the EGF receptor expressed on several solid tumors may also be used Van Cutsem et al. J Clin Oncol. 2007 25 13 1658 1664 . The cell binding agent that comprises the conjugates and the modified cell binding agents of the present invention may be of any kind presently known or that become known and includes peptides and non peptides.

Examples of in vitro potency and target specificity of antibody cytotoxic agent conjugates of the present invention are shown in . All of the conjugates with cytotoxic agent antibody ratios of 1 3 are extremely cytotoxic on the antigen positive cancer cells with an ICin the low picomolar range. Antigen negative cell lines remained viable when exposed to the same conjugates. The target specificity of conjugates of the indolinobenzodiazepine dimers are 1000 with the antibodies huN901 anti CD56 and muB38.1 anti EpCAM .

In addition the conjugate is also highly potent towards the multidrug resistant COLO 205 MDR cell line with an ICvalue of 16 pM. Similarly the huN901 IGN3 conjugate was highly potent with an ICvalue of 15 pM for antigen positive RH30 cells . Addition of an excess of unconjugated huN901 antibody abolished this cytotoxic effect IC 3 nM demonstrating antigen specificity. Another huN901 IGN conjugate huN901 IGN 07 also showed high potency towards antigen expressing RH 30 cells with drug load dependent cytotoxicity and ICvalues of 16 pm 3 pM and 2 pM respectively for conjugates bearing 1.2 2.0 and 3.0 linked drugs per antibody molecule . Similar results were obtained with huN901 IGN07 and huN901 IGN03 towards antigen positive Molp 8 cells. Hu901 IGN07 gave ICvalues of 5 pM 3 pM and 2 pM respectively for IGN07 loads of 1.2 2.0 and 3.0 . The huN901 IGN07 and IGN03 conjugates were much less potent towards antigen negative Namalwa cells with ICvalues ranging from 1000 pM to 3000 pM . The B38.1 IGN10 conjugate was also specifically potent killing antigen positive COLO 205 cells with an ICof 17 pM and less potent 170 pM for antigen negative Ramos cells .

In this study the anti tumor activity of chB38.1 IGN14 was investigated in female nude mice bearing COLO 205 tumors a human colon carcinoma model. COLO 205 tumor cells 2 10cells mouse were subcutaneously inoculated at a volume of 0.1 mL mouse in the area over the right shoulder of female athymic nude mice 5 weeks of age. Eight days after tumor cell inoculation mice were randomized into groups n 6 per group by tumor volume. Treatment was initiated the day of randomization and groups included a control group dosed with PBS 200 L injection naked chB38.1 antibody 2.8 mg kg non targeting chKTI IGN14 50 g kg conjugate and chB38.1 IGN14 50 g kg IGN14 dose 2.5 mg kg antibody dose . All treatments were administered twice on a weekly schedule day 8 and 15 post cell inoculation . Arrows indicate dosing times post inoculation. All treatments were well tolerated with the mean body weight losses comparable to loss seen in PBS control mice. Median tumor volume vs time is shown with the data demonstrating the anti tumor activity of the chB38.1 IGN14 conjugate. Both the non targeting and the naked antibody show no activity beyond that seen with the vehicle control suggesting that the anti tumor activity observed with the chB38.1 IGN 14 conjugate is antigen specific.
