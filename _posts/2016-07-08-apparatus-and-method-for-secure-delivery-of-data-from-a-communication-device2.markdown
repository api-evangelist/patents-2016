This application is a Continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 091 679 filed Nov. 27 2013. The contents of the foregoing are hereby incorporated by reference into this application as if set forth herein in full.

The subject disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for secure delivery of data from a communication device.

Electronic devices are being utilized with more frequency to store data and distribute the data to other devices. The data can often be private or confidential and users desire to have confidence that any data that they are providing to another device is being done securely to avoid unauthorized users from accessing the data.

The subject disclosure describes among other things illustrative embodiments in which a secure element and a secure device processor of a mobile communication device can be utilized together to enable a secure upload or delivery of data from the mobile communication device to another device such as an application function server another end user device a removable memory device and so forth.

In one or more embodiments master keys can be distributed to the secure element such as from a remote management server utilizing a mutual authentication process so that the secure element can store the master keys without providing the master keys to the secure device processor. In one or more embodiments the secure element can derive other keys such as an upload transport key and or a data protection key from corresponding ones of the master keys which are each part of keysets that enable encryption and then decryption by different devices such as an encryption by the secure device processor of the mobile communication device and a decryption by the application server or other recipient device . In one or more embodiments a synchronization process can be utilized so that the derived keys of each keyset e.g. a paired keyset of upload transport keys and or a paired keyset of data protection keys are the same to enable encryption and subsequent decryption and or data modification and subsequent data un modification by different devices.

In one or more embodiments the secure device processor can receive the upload transport key and the data protection key from the secure element without receiving the master keys and can apply these keys to the data for modification and or encryption of the data. For instance the data protection key can be utilized by the secure device processor for modifying the original data e.g. data stored by the secure device processor or data stored in another memory of the mobile communication device . This modification can include adding additional information to the data e.g. permission authentication data a time stamp and so forth and or applying an encryption to the data. The upload transport key can then be utilized by the secure device processor for applying an encryption to the already modified data. In one or more embodiments each of the upload transport key and the data protection key can be utilized for separate encryptions resulting in a double encrypted data.

In one or more embodiments the recipient device the device receiving the modified and encrypted data can have only the upload transport key or can have both the upload transport key and the data protection key. For instance a recipient device may have only the upload transport key so that the recipient device can decrypt the encrypted modified data into modified data and can store the modified data without having the ability to un modify the data. In another example the recipient device can have both of the data protection key and the upload transport key so that both keys are applied to the encrypted modified data to provide access to the original data.

In one or more embodiments the secure element e.g. executing a secure upload management function the secure device processor e.g. executing a secure upload engine and or a device processor can be separate but in communication with each other.

The first operations can include receiving master keys from a remote management server storing the master keys in the secure element memory and generating an upload transport key and a data protection key from the master keys. The communication device can also include a secure device processor having a secure device processor memory that stores second executable instructions that when executed by the secure device processor facilitate performance of second operations. The second operations can include receiving the upload transport key and the data protection key from the secure element without receiving the master keys. The second operations can include obtaining data for transmission to a recipient device modifying the data using the data protection key to generate a modified data and encrypting the modified data using the upload transport key to generate an encrypted modified data. The secure device processor can be separate from the secure element and in communication with the secure element.

In one or more embodiments the secure upload engine of the SDP can facilitate establishing a communication channel with the recipient device and can provide the double encrypted data over the communication channel to the recipient device and or to enable the recipient device to perform a first decryption of the double encrypted data utilizing a corresponding upload transport key. In one or more embodiments the secure element can receive the master keys from a remote management server where the recipient device receives from the remote management server the corresponding upload transport key or a master transport key for deriving the corresponding upload transport key. In one or more embodiments the SDP and the secure element can perform a mutual authentication with each other utilizing a keyset received via the remote management server where the SDP can receive an upload request from one of the recipient device another communication device an application being executed by the mobile communication device or a user input received at the mobile communication device and where the obtaining of the data is in response to the receiving of the upload request. In one or more embodiments the recipient device can be a removable memory device having a connection port to enable a physical coupling with the mobile communication device and wherein the SDP can provide the double encrypted data to the removable memory device via the connection port to enable the recipient device to be removed from the mobile communication device and subsequently coupled with an end user device for transmission of the double encrypted data to the end user device to enable the end user device to perform a first decryption of the double encrypted data utilizing a corresponding upload transport key.

System enables components of the secure services platform e.g. a secure upload management function of the secure element to perform operations including one or more of receiving master keys from the remote management server storing the master keys in a secure element memory and generating an upload transport key and a data protection key from the master keys. The secure element can receive the master keys from the remote management server and can receive a request from the secure device processor for the upload transport key and the data protection key where the generating of the upload transport key and the data protection key is in response to the request from the secure device processor. In one or more embodiments the secure element can be provisioned from the remote management server utilizing a remote management keyset.

System enables components of the secure services platform to upload or otherwise deliver data to the recipient device and or through the use of encryption and modification by the SDP according to derived keys that are generated by the secure element from master keys which are inaccessible to the SDP . The recipient device can have access to one or more of the derived keys which can enable the recipient device to decrypt and un modify the data so that the data is returned to its original form or the recipient device can have limited access to the recipient keys such that the recipient data can only decrypt the data without being able to un modify the data. Other devices such as secondary recipient device can retrieve or otherwise obtain the data from the recipient device . In one embodiment other derived keys can subsequently be applied to the data during the delivery of the data from the recipient device to the secondary recipient device .

In one or more embodiments the recipient device can be a removable memory device e.g. a memory stick having a connection port e.g. a USB port to enable a physical coupling with the communication device and the secure device processor can provide encrypted modified data to the removable memory device via the connection port to enable the recipient device to be removed from the mobile communication device and subsequently coupled with an end user device for transmission of the encrypted modified data to the end user device to enable the end user device to perform a decryption of the encrypted modified data utilizing a corresponding upload transport key.

In one or more embodiments the derived key s e.g. the data protection and upload transport keys can be sent from the mobile communication device e.g. by the secure device processor to the recipient device e.g. the application server along with the encrypted modified data e.g. in the same data channel or in different data channels by encrypting the derived keys such as using an asymmetric encryption technique. This exemplary embodiment could be utilized as an alternative to a derived key synchronization method described herein. Whether a derived key synchronization procedure is utilized or whether a transmission of the derived keys procedure is utilized can depend on a number of factors such as a relationship between the mobile communication device and the recipient device the nature of the data e.g. highly confidential vs. low level confidential 

The RMS can perform a remote provisioning and management function to load applications content and or other information e.g. various keysets into the secure element and or SDP . In this embodiment the RMS can provision the authentication management function and real time encryption key generator on the secure element and can provision the real time encryption engine on the SDP . This can be done securely by the use of one or more remote management keysets. In one embodiment before the secure services platform can be used for communication the SDP can be authenticated by the secure element . In one embodiment this can be done using a UICC SDP keyset. The UICC SDP keyset may be provisioned remotely by the RMS or locally by an authorized user. In this embodiment after the secure element and SDP are mutually authenticated using the UICC SDP keyset they can communicate via a signaling path within the secure services platform . The UICC SDP keyset may be used for secure communication during initial loading and provisioning. However the keys being utilized may be different. In one embodiment the path between the secure element and the SDP can go through the device processor rather than directly between the secure element and the SDP.

In this embodiment of the secure services platform enables the secure delivery of data through encryption and modification by the SDP according to derived keys that are generated from master keys stored by the secure element and which are inaccessible to the SDP . The modification of the data can include the adding of additional information to the data such as authentication data permissions time stamps user credentials digital rights management information and so forth. The modification can also include encryption such that the data is doubly encrypted utilizing separate derived keys e.g. the upload transport key and the data protection key .

Referring to a system is depicted which illustrates a secure process in which data can be securely uploaded or otherwise delivered from a user device to a recipient device such as an application server within the network by using a secure element which may exist within a UICC and a secure device processor as a secure download platform. The secure element can include a secure upload management function which can perform the following tasks storing a master set of keys and credentials and or providing derived keys to the secure upload engine. The secure device processor can include the secure upload engine which can perform the following tasks processing user device and or network requests to upload data communicating with an authentication function to authenticate the user authenticating and communicating with the secure upload application server to upload data uploading data to the secure upload application server or another recipient device such as another end user device or a memory device communicating with the secure upload management function to obtain derived keys and or modifying data as specified by the derived keys it obtains from the secure upload management function.

The secure upload application server of can perform the following tasks storing uploaded data decrypting and normalizing e.g. un modifying data based on the keys it has stored authenticating and communicating with the secure upload engine storing a set of keys e.g. derivative keys and or master keys provided to it by the remote management server maintaining user information processing requests from the user another end user device and or the network to download content or applications and or storing uploaded data. In one or more embodiments the remote management server can create and load the secure upload applications described above into both the secure element e.g. a UICC and the secure device processor. The remote management server can also update the credentials and permissions that are stored in the secure upload management function. For example these operations can be done securely by the use of one or more remote management keysets. These keysets can be used to mutually authenticate the UICC and the secure device processor with the remote management server and to enable encryption between them.

Referring to system is depicted which illustrates loading or otherwise provisioning the end user device s with the applications that are utilized by the secure services platform for performing the secure upload or delivery of data. Two applications can be loaded or otherwise provisioned to the mobile communication device the secure upload management function and the secure upload engine. If the applications have not been loaded during the manufacturing process for the mobile communication device then at upon receiving a request for the service the secure upload application server can instruct the remote management server to download the secure upload management function to the UICC and to download the secure upload engine to the secure device processor. At the remote management server can download the secure upload management function to the UICC and the secure upload engine to the secure device processor. Remote Management Keysets can be used to securely transmit information from the remote management server to the mobile communication device. This process can involve mutual authentication and encryption. At the UICC and the secure device processor can mutually authenticate with each other once the two are provisioned using the UICC SDP Keyset. At an initial set of user credentials and master keysets are sent from the remote management server to the secure upload management function. This can include a master upload transport keyset and a master data protection encryption keyset. At the remote management server can instruct the secure upload engine to register and associate with an authentication processor function. The secure upload engine can register and associate with the authentication processor function. At the remote management server can transmit the upload transport keyset to the secure upload application server and may or may not also transmit the data encryption keyset.

Referring to system is depicted which illustrates a process for securely uploading or delivering data from a mobile communication device to a recipient device through use of multiple derived keys that enable encryption and modification of the data. This process can involve the secure upload of data already stored in the device to the recipient device which in this example is described as a secure upload application server although various other devices can be recipient devices such as other end user devices memory devices and so forth. As an example the user can select data that is already stored in the device for transmission. This example is described according to user input by a user at the mobile communication device however the exemplary process can also be initiated according to an application executed by the mobile communication device or by another device. At the user selects a set of data that is stored in the device is to be uploaded securely to the secure upload application server. At the secure upload engine checks to see if the user has been previously authenticated and if so whether or not the user needs to be re authenticated. If the user is to be authenticated the secure upload engine can request for the authentication processor function to authenticate the user. As an example at the authentication processor function can prompt the user to authenticate such as using a pre determined method. At once the authentication processor function obtains the credential from the user it processes the credential for analysis by the authentication management function. At the authentication management function can analyze the credential and can verify whether or not the user should be authenticated. At once authentication is verified the secure upload engine can request an upload transport key and a data protection key from the secure upload management function. These keys can be derived from a master set of keys stored within the secure upload management function. These keys may be used for a variety of security purposes including encryption and authentication. The data protection key may also include other types of information to protect the data including a time stamp and user defined credentials. At the secure upload engine can locate and retrieve the user selected data from the secure upload storage. In one embodiment the secure upload storage may not necessarily be within the secure device processor for example it can be stored in a memory of the device processor . At the secure upload engine can apply the derived data protection key to the data that was retrieved from the secure upload storage. At the secure upload engine can establish a data channel or other communication connection depending on the communication protocol being utilized with the secure upload application server. The two can mutually authenticate with each other using the authentication parameters of the derived upload transport key. Once mutually authenticated the secure upload engine can transmit the data to the secure upload application server. The data may be encrypted using the encryption parameters of the derived upload transport key. At the user can be notified if the transmission was successful or not. Re transmission of all or some of the data can also be implemented by the secure device processor such as based on a detected transmission error. In one embodiment at the secure upload application server can decrypt the data using first the upload transport key and then again using the data protection key if it has one. If the secure upload application server has decrypted the data using the data protection key the data is now subject to modification including the addition of new credentials file permissions and or re encryption.

Method can begin at where one or more master keys are received and stored by the secure element of the mobile communication device . The secure element can store the master keys e.g. in a secure element memory which can be a physically or logically isolated and separate component from other memory of the mobile communication device without allowing other components or other devices to access the stored master keys such as prohibiting the secure device processor and or the device processor from accessing the master keys. In one or more embodiments the master keys can be received from a remote management server where the remote management server can distribute corresponding master keys for some or all of those master keys to other devices e.g. recipient devices and or . In one embodiment the provisioning of the master keys to the secure element can be performed utilizing a remote management keyset. In another embodiment mutual authentication e.g. of the secure element the secure device processor and or the remote management server can be performed or required prior to the master keys being provisioned to the secure element .

In one embodiment at a user that is associated with an upload request e.g. request to upload to an application server request to transfer data to a removable memory device request to transmit data to another end user device or other device can be authenticated. For instance the authentication can be based on a user credential s that is received by the secure device processor via user input at the mobile communication device where the user credential is compared with a corresponding user credential stored by the secure element . Various types of user credentials can be used for user authentication including user identification information passwords biometric data and so forth. Various other types of authentication processes can be implemented at the mobile device such as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 14 061 380 filed on Oct. 23 2013 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

In one or more embodiments the upload request can be initiated based on user input at the mobile communication device . However the upload request can be initiated by other sources such as an upload request initiated by an application being executed on the mobile communication device which may or may not require user authentication e.g. as performed at . In one embodiment of this example the upload request can be performed automatically without notice being provided to the user of the mobile communication device . In another embodiment of this example the upload request can be initiated automatically but can provide notice or request authorization from the user to proceed such as a notice or permission request being presented at the mobile communication device . In another embodiment the upload request can be initiated by another device which may or may not require user authentication e.g. as performed at . For instance an application server or another end user device may transmit the upload request to the mobile communication device where it is processed by the secure device processor .

At derivative key s can be generated from the master key s by the secure element . The derivative key s can be provided from the secure element to the secure device processor without providing the master key s to the secure device processor. For example the secure element can generate an upload transport key and a data protection key from a master transport key and a master protection key respectively that are being stored by the secure element memory which is inaccessible to the secure device processor . The secure element can then provide the upload transport key and the data protection key to the secure device processor without providing the master transport key and the master protection key to the secure device processor.

In one or more embodiments at the generating of the derivative keys by the secure element can be synchronized with a generation of a corresponding derivative key at another device such as at the recipient device the secondary recipient device the remote management server or another device that can provide the derivative key to the recipient device and or . The synchronization can occur in numerous ways such as a notice to establish synchronization being sent by the secure element to the device that will be generating the corresponding derivative key s . The notice can include information that enables the corresponding key to be generated including time data identification data and so forth.

The timing of the generation of the derivative keys can vary. For example the secure element can generate the derivative keys in response to a request for the derivative keys from the secure device processor . The request for the derivative keys can be provided by the secure device processor to the secure element before or after user authentication if performed . In one embodiment some of these processes can be performed simultaneously to expedite the process. For instance the initiation of the generation of the derivative keys by the secure element can be performed in response to a generation request from the secure device processor which is triggered by the upload request. In this example the user authentication at can be performed while the derivative keys are being generated. Continuing with this example in the event that the user authentication is not successful or otherwise cannot be completed the generated derivative keys can be deleted or otherwise rendered inoperable by the secure element without providing the derivative keys to the secure device processor . In one embodiment initiating generation of the derivative keys prior to the user authentication process being completed can provide time for other steps that may be taken as part of the derivative key process such as communication with a recipient device for synchronization of generation of corresponding derivative keys at .

At the secure device processor can obtain the data that is to be transmitted to the recipient device . The data can be stored at various locations of the mobile communication device such as a secure upload storage of the secure device processor which is logically or physically isolated from other memory outside of the secure device processor. The data can also be obtained from the device processor such as stored in a memory of the mobile communication device that is accessible to the device processor .

At the data can be modified by the secure device processor using a first derivative key e.g. the data protection key to generate modified data. The data modification process by the secure device processor which utilizes the data protection key can involve adding additional information to the data and or encrypting the data. The additional information can be various types of information such as authentication data permissions timestamps and so forth.

At the secure device processor can encrypt the modified data using the upload transport key to generate an encrypted modified data. In one or more embodiments the data is now double encrypted data e.g. a first encryption according to the data protection key and a second encryption according to the upload transport key .

At the encrypted modified data can be transmitted or provided by the secure device processor such as via a transceiver of the mobile communication device that can be controlled by the device processor to the recipient device . This can be performed via a wireless communication session e.g. establishing a data channel between the mobile communication device and the recipient device or can be performed via a physical connection with the recipient device such as where the recipient device is a memory stick that has been removably connected with the mobile communication device via a Universal Serial Bus USB port of the mobile communication device .

In one or more embodiments first executable instructions e.g. the secure upload management function can be provisioned to the secure element memory and second executable instructions e.g. the secure upload engine can be provisioned to the secure device processor memory from the remote management server such as utilizing a remote management keyset.

In one embodiment the providing of the encrypted modified data to the recipient device can enable the recipient device to perform a decryption of the encrypted modified data utilizing a corresponding upload transport key. In this example the recipient device does not have access to a corresponding data protection key so that the recipient device after the decryption provides storage only in the form of modified data which may be encrypted data according to the data protection key . Further to this example other devices such as the mobile communication device or the secondary recipient device can have the necessary data protection key so that the modified data can be retrieved from the recipient device and can be unmodified e.g. performing a second decryption based on the data protection key to provide access to the original data.

In another embodiment the recipient device can have both the corresponding data protection key and the corresponding upload transport key so that the encrypted modified data can be returned to and stored in its original form at the recipient device. Whether or not the recipient device has one or both of the corresponding data protection key and the corresponding upload transport key can depend on various factors such as the type of data ownership of the data type of recipient device identity of the entity operating the recipient device e.g. a governmental authority vs. a private entity and so forth.

In one or more embodiments the recipient device s can receive from a remote management server a corresponding derived key e.g. the corresponding upload transport key and or the corresponding data protection key and or can receive a master key s e.g. a master transport key and or master protection key for deriving the corresponding derived key e.g. the corresponding upload transport key and or the corresponding data protection key .

In one or more embodiments the recipient device can be a removable memory device e.g. a memory stick having a connection port e.g. a USB port to enable a physical coupling with the communication device and the secure device processor can provide encrypted modified data to the removable memory device via the connection port to enable the recipient device to be removed from the mobile communication device and subsequently coupled with an end user device for transmission of the encrypted modified data to the end user device to enable the end user device to perform a decryption of the encrypted modified data utilizing a corresponding upload transport key.

System can enable data e.g. video content image content audio content application data gaming data and so forth to be securely uploaded from a mobile communication device responsive to a request that is initiated by a user by the mobile communication device by a network device e.g. the application server and or by another communication device e.g. another end user device . In one or more embodiments data can be modified before transmission. This modification may include encryption and or the addition of information such as authentication data permissions and other types of information. In one or more embodiments the secure deice processor can perform the modification of the data and the transmission of the modified and or encrypted data. In one or more embodiments a set of master keys can be stored in the secure element which may exist in the form of a UICC. A subset of these keys can be stored in another device such as the application server. In one or more embodiments keys derived from the master keys can be used to modify the data for transmission.

In one or more embodiments of the system master keys which are stored at the UICC do not leave the UICC. In one or more embodiments the application server or other recipient device may unmodify the data depending on the keys accessible to it or otherwise in its possession. In one or more embodiments the user can be authenticated to the UICC the UICC can be mutually authenticated with the secure device processor and the UICC can be mutually authenticated with the application server or other intended recipient device . In one or more embodiments an authentication function can be used. In one or more embodiments the data can already be stored within the device.
