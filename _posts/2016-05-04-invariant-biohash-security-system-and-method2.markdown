This U.S. Patent Application is a continuation application and claims the benefit of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 933 580 filed on Nov. 5 2015 of the same inventors and entitled INVARIANT BIOHASH SECURITY SYSTEM AND METHOD which in turn claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62 107 027 filed Jan. 23 2015 of the same inventors and entitled COMPUTER OVERRIDE BYPASS OF ACCOUNT TRANSFER COMPUTER SYSTEMS the contents of each of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

The field of the invention generally relates to various technological improvements in systems methods and program products used in cash sweep systems such as deposit sweep systems. In embodiments the invention generally relates to biometric based security systems to ensure authentication of electronic requests associated with cash sweep processes.

Deposit sweep systems transfer funds between trading accounts such as brokerage accounts and interest bearing deposit accounts such as bank or other depository accounts and other cash management vehicles. Such systems are implemented using computers specifically programmed to carry out deposit sweep operations including transfer and allocation operations.

A shortcoming of existing deposit sweep systems is that they require cooperation on a technological level from the partner source institutions. Such cooperation can entail ensuring compatibility of the computer systems used to perform deposit sweep transactions ensuring existence of technological access to source and or destination computer systems and ensuring compliance with any restrictions or conditions imposed by the source and destination institutions. Deposit sweep programs thus may require as a preliminary step establishment of technological connections among particular source institutions destination institutions and a deposit sweep management computer system. Deposit sweep program offerings may thus be limited to customers of particular partner source and destination institutions such as brokerage institutions and or depository institutions or otherwise may require prospective deposit sweep program customers to establish accounts at such partner institutions. Heretofore there has been a technological barrier to customers participating in deposit sweep systems without the cooperation and participation of the source institutions from which the funds to be swept are otherwise maintained. Therefore it is desirable to provide a technical solution that bypasses such need for cooperation and provides greater flexibility to execute deposit sweep transactions with any available source or destination institution.

A second shortcoming of existing deposit sweep systems is the lack of technological mechanisms by which customers can exert control over the computer implemented deposit sweep transactions to control which banks are used to store the customer s funds. Interaction between a deposit sweep system and an account holder from a separate source institution proves to be difficult among existing deposit sweep systems and a technological manner in which to obtain such direct interaction and thus user control is desirable. Often if a user knew of which particular depository institution his or her funds are being held at or are to be held at at any given moment a user may object to the use of particular depository institutions for a number of reasons including lack of insurance difficulty of access to funds or personal preference to name a few reasons. Prior art deposit sweep systems lack technological mechanisms by which users can be informed in real time or even contemporaneously of the institutions at which their funds will be deposited and by which users can exert control over the institutions that are used. Often users must wait for a monthly statement to arrive. Technological improvements over such prior art deposit sweep systems are desired to inject customer control and or timely notification into automated computer implemented deposit sweep processes.

A third shortcoming of existing deposit sweep systems is security. Data hacks and phishing scams pose a persistent threat particularly to data stored on computer systems or verification of user authentication information. Prior art security systems require storage of one or more reference credentials for a user including biometric information passwords pin numbers and or fingerprint data to which user access credentials are compared to authenticate them. The stored reference credentials are subject to data leaks and data breaches. While stored secret information such as passwords may be changed if compromised biometric information cannot be changed as the various biometric signatures of a particular individual are generally unique and non varying. Moreover some users are reluctant to store their biometric information either in a device or at a cloud storage system e.g. at a server where the user cannot guarantee that others will not be able to access that personal biometric data. In addition to matching with reference credentials other prior art security systems use public key cryptography that enables a user to provide a digital signature using a private key which signature is verifiable using a corresponding public key. However such systems require storage or memorization of the private key which can be expressed as a large alphanumeric sequence. Memorization can be difficult and again stored keys may be leaked or hacked. Therefore it is desirable to provide a security system that does not store secret user credentials but that also does not require a user to input or provide a long private key or store sensitive biometric information which may be subject to a potential data breach.

An object of the present invention to address one or more the above problems as outlined in the prior art.

The field of the invention generally relates to various technological improvements in systems methods and program products used in deposit sweep systems or other cash sweep systems. In embodiments the invention generally relates to systems methods and program products used to bypass technological cooperation from institutions holding trading accounts depository accounts and or other cash management vehicles and or cash management accounts such as DDAs MMDAs NOW accounts stable value funds credit interest programs to name a few in order to transfer funds among those accounts freely. In embodiments the invention further relates generally to biometric based security systems to ensure authentication of electronic requests associated with deposit sweep processes. In embodiments the invention further relates generally to new technological mechanisms to communicate with account holders so that such account holders can control the depository institutions in which funds are being held.

In embodiments a biometric private key generation system may generate a private key based at least in part upon an input biometric reading and an input password which may be a personal identification number PIN . In embodiments the resulting private key may not be stored but rather may be used to provide a digital signature for an electronic message. The private key may be deleted from the system after it is used to generate the digital signature. The signature may be verified by other entities using a public key corresponding to the private key in accordance with public key cryptography techniques. The private key may be regenerated by inputting both a new instance of the biometric reading as well as a new instance of the password.

The present invention generally relates to various technological improvements in systems methods and program products used to transfer funds between trading accounts and interest bearing accounts.

The following description is presented to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements. Various modifications to the embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In the following description numerous details are set forth for the purpose of explanation. However one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the invention may be practiced without the use of these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the description of the invention with unnecessary detail. Thus the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.

The automatic fund transfer programs of clearing firm computers currently control transfers between brokerage firms and cash management products e.g. money market mutual funds FDIC insured cash management products held in banks and other depository institution and other cash management products. Note that a clearing firm or all or part of its functionality may be implemented in an independent entity or in a source institution such as a broker dealer or may be implemented in a source institution such as a program bank or other depository entity or may be affiliated therewith. In particular the automatic transfer functions of clearing firm computers such as sweep programs for example in many instances control coverage of the settlement of trades on behalf of a client in investment products. In embodiments the invention provides a technical solution to enable an individual client to manage and perform fund transfer operations such as sweep transactions while bypassing automatic fund transfer functions if any in clearing firm computers and or source institution computers and or destination institution computers to eliminate the electronic processing delay and expense attendant thereto and in embodiments clearing firm and or source institution and or destination institution computer control. The technical problem solved is a unique problem caused by the shift of buy and sell transactions from the manual realm to computer control so that an individual client no longer can directly control its buy and sell transactions. Note that in embodiments of the invention a transfer function at a clearing firm computer or source or destination computer may be accessed by or on behalf of the client to make fund transfers but this access will not be as part of an automatic transfer function of those entities. Thus the active participation of the clearing firm and or the source institution and or the destination institution is bypassed though technological embodiments of the present invention.

Referring to there is shown a schematic block diagram representing institutions clients and a transaction management system. The individual clients are represented by the client blocks . . . N. The transaction management system TMS for performing the operations necessary to the automatic fund transfer programs of clearing firm and or source institution and or destination institution computers is represented by the block .

Each of the source institutions is also shown with multiple different client accounts e.g. for the client suffices . . . N. Source institutions may be banks credit unions other types of depository institutions registered investment advisors broker dealers asset managers trust companies retirement programs other financial institutions or intermediaries to name a few. Typically the source institutions are the institutions that interact with the clients that are placing or authorizing the respective clients funds to go into and be managed by the system. Note that a source institution can be a clearing institution for one or more other source institutions or an intermediary for other source institutions. Source institutions can hold source accounts relating to securities and or bonds including trading thereof.

Depository institutions e.g. destination institutions are represented by the blocks . . . P. Depository institutions can be any institution that is authorized to accept deposits and issue certificates of deposit. This would include state and national banks state and federal savings banks savings and loan associations credit unions and probably some industrial loan companies depending on current law. Most but not necessarily all would have government backed insurance such as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance insurance for credit unions or state insurance. Depository institutions can include banks holding bank accounts or institutions providing time deposit instruments negotiable order of withdrawal NOW accounts money market deposit accounts MMDAs aggregated MMDAs demand deposit accounts DDAs aggregated DDAs and or certificates of deposit CDs to name a few. Each of the depository institutions is shown with an aggregated demand deposit account holding the funds of multiple clients and an aggregated money market deposit account holding the funds of multiple clients. However in embodiments there may be a separate DDA and MMDA for each of multiple clients. In embodiments a source institution may also be a depository institution and vice versa.

Such a sweep transaction may be from a source account at a source institution to a depository account at a depository institution. A sweep transaction may also be from a depository account at a depository institution to a source account at a source institution. In other embodiments a sweep transaction may comprise an allocation or reallocation of funds among a plurality of institutions such as a plurality of depository institutions or a plurality of both source and depository institutions. In embodiments such allocations may involve omnibus depository accounts at one or more depository institutions.

Sweep transactions may be triggered by transactions at and or transaction data obtained from one or more transaction sources or source institutions. Source institutions can include broker dealers brokerage firms card servicers bill payment servicers ACH debit and or credit servicers check payment or processing servicers to name a few. Examples of types of transactions that may occur in a source institution and thus trigger an event can include credit and or debit events against the customer account at the source institution. For example clients may access their funds for deposits and withdrawals from various transaction sources. Thus card servicers represent credit and debit card processing organizations and networks. Internet bill payment servicers represent service providers for bill payment checks and funds exchanges generally via the Internet or other electronic or data networks . ACH debits and credits represents various direct deposit and withdrawal clearinghouse services. Check payment servicers represent debit and credit transactions generated by paper check processing. Source institutions can also be associated with transactions generated as a result of other payment vehicles such as touch tone bill payment . Accordingly clients may access their agent managed funds by credit and debit cards for Internet transactions by direct deposits and withdrawals by checks and by other payment and funds exchange vehicles. Transaction data may be obtained from any of these source institutions. In embodiments respective user access credentials may be used e.g. by a transaction management system to access electronic portals at such source institutions to obtain account balanced and or transaction information such as order amounts and or dates. In embodiments a transaction management system may monitor respective accounts at the source institutions to determine when transactions have occurred or are scheduled to occur as described herein. Monitoring such accounts can comprise accessing account information such as by using user access credentials to access respective electronic portals e.g. according to a monitoring frequency obtaining account information e.g. balance information transaction information to name a few and or assessing a date and or time associated with a last update of the account information and or a date and or time associated with placement of order or fulfillment of orders for one or more transactions. In embodiments assessing the date and or time can comprise comparing such date and or time to a date and or time associated with the last retrieval of account information to determine if the account information is new. In embodiments monitoring can comprise comparing current balance amounts to previous balance amounts to determine whether a change in balance has occurred.

Sweep transactions may be triggered by account balances in either the source institution or depository institution reaching or exceeding a threshold amount e.g. a monetary amount such as a dollar amount . Such a threshold amount may represent a maximum account balance e.g. a maximum permissible or desirable balance or a minimum account balance e.g. a minimum permissible or desirable balance which balance limits may be determined by user preference government regulation insurance requirements e.g. maximum insurable amounts for an account or institution which may be measured per customer and or institution requirements e.g. required minimum account balances to avoid incurring fees . Exceeding a threshold may comprise a balance or projected balance e.g. a projected post transaction balance for a pending transaction rising above the threshold. In other embodiments exceeding the threshold may comprise falling below the threshold.

A need for one or more sweep transactions may be determined automatically by a transaction management computer system e.g. based at least in part upon the occurrence of the sweep transaction triggers described herein. In embodiments sweep transactions may be performed on certain days and or times. For example 9 AM E.T. 5 PM E.T. 8 PM E.T. a certain day of the week or a certain date of the month to name a few. Certain sweep transactions may require user approval. Such transactions may be defined by transaction parameters or transaction characteristics such as source account identifiers destination account identifiers transfer amounts and or allocation amounts to name a few. Transaction satisfying certain predefined characteristics may require user approval such as transactions to or from particular accounts or institutions or transactions involving amounts exceeding a preset permissible transfer amount. Such characteristics may be stored as exceptions to default permissible transaction characteristics.

A transaction management computer system may monitor one or more accounts at one or more source and or depository institutions to obtain the information necessary to determine when sweep transaction triggers occur. Such information can include account balance information pending order information and or transaction information such as completed order information. Account monitoring may be performed according to a predefined schedule e.g. once per day such as at 5 PM E.T. twice per day such as at 9 AM E.T. and 5 PM E.T. once per week once per month twice per month to name a few. An account monitoring frequency may govern how often to monitor one or more accounts. The system may monitor accounts on demand e.g. upon receipt of a user electronic request to refresh account information. In embodiments the system may receive or may determine an account update schedule for one or more particular institutions e.g. brokerage institutions. Such a schedule may identify when account information is updated for access via a computer based portal or may identify when transactions involving the account are executed or settled. The system may monitor the accounts according to the schedule of updates.

Thus the present invention improves upon prior computer implemented deposit sweep systems which could not automatically institute such a trigger themselves and instead would need to rely upon source institutions or the customer to initiate a sweep event. Thus the technological solution of the present invention is very advantageous. It can expand the scope of sweep programs to cover additional source and or depository institutions and or can automate sweep triggering such as deposit sweep triggering without input or instruction from third parties other than sweep settings which may be stored in advance in memory and may be optional.

In embodiments the transaction management system may monitor a customer s emails e.g. by accessing the customer s email account using email login credentials for the email account. The system may search for and or determine emails matching certain criteria such as one or more sender names or sender email addresses e.g. corresponding to financial institutions and or determining subject or body information matching certain predefined text e.g. the words account balance and or transaction to name a few . In embodiments the system may receive forwarded emails from the customer. The customer may set rules to forward transaction notification emails or other relevant emails automatically. In embodiments the customer may specify at the source and or destination institutions a transaction management system email address to receive account alerts. Upon receipt or detection of such an email the transaction management system may retrieve account information from one or more source and or depository institution accounts associated with the customer.

These transaction settings are default and or user specified settings from which the TMS can generate electronic monitoring rules and or electronic transaction rules. Listed below are example transaction setting types where a value may be input an option selected or a default setting used to trigger generation of a rule using the setting. In embodiments a setting may comprise a value e.g. a threshold value which may be an absolute value. In other embodiments the value may be a proportion e.g. percentage .

A Source Account Minimum Balances setting is a minimum balance to be maintained in a source account. The TMS may create a rule to generate transfer instructions to transfer funds from a destination account to the source account to maintain this balance. This threshold minimum balance may be set for each source account individually or may be used for all accounts. In embodiments one or more destination accounts may be set for each of the source accounts or a default one or more destination accounts may be set from which to transfer funds to maintain the source account minimum balance. In embodiments the threshold minimum balance may be an absolute value or a percentage e.g. of the account balance.

A Source Account Maximum Balances setting is a maximum balance to be maintained in a source account. Based at least in part upon this threshold the TMS may generate a rule to perform a subtraction operation or threshold comparison operation to determine when there is an excess amount in the source account over this source account maximum balance threshold and or to determine a corresponding excess amount. The rule may then initiate generation of instructions to transfer funds from the respective source account to a client destination account to remove the excess amount. In embodiments this threshold may be set for each source account.

A Source Account Target Balance setting is a target balance to be maintained in the source account. In embodiments setting the target balance value may generate a rule to provide an electronic notice to the client device if the source account balance is less than this threshold. In embodiments violating this target balance e.g. via one or more executed or pending transactions may initiate a transfer of funds to restore the target balance.

A Destination Account Minimum Balances setting is a minimum balance to maintain in a destination account. Based at least in part upon this value the TMS may generate a rule to prevent transfer from this destination account if the transfer transaction will cause the selected destination account balance to drop below the destination account minimum threshold. In embodiments the TMS may transfer from multiple destination accounts e.g. according to a predefined order and or a default order to avoid violating the destination account minimum balance rule. Thus the next destination account in an ordered list may be selected by the TMS when the minimum balance will be violated for a given destination account. The destination account minimum balance threshold may be set for each destination account.

An Account Monitoring Frequency setting may determine how often the TMS monitors the source and or destination accounts e.g. once per day twice per day every hour and or every 5 minutes to name a few and or specific times at which to monitor accounts e.g. 9 am and or 5 pm market open market close to name a few . In embodiments the setting may comprise an instruction to obtain account information following a transaction. This may be a default electronic instruction for the TMS .

A Transaction Frequency setting may determine how often the TMS will initiate transfer transactions e.g. as necessary no more than once per day cap of 5 transactions per month to name a few .

A Default Destination Account setting may allow the client to select a default destination account and or a default order of destination accounts e.g. if the first account is insufficient or a transfer will violate a destination account minimum balance rule then the TMS may use a second account in the order etc. . In embodiments a rule may be set to transfer from two accounts a set percentage or amount.

A Source Destination Account Links setting provides links between source and destination accounts. For example three source accounts may be linked to one destination account while a fourth source account may be linked to a second destination account. Thus in embodiments the TMS may perform transactions as described herein between a source account and the one or more destination accounts to which it is linked in the TMS.

In embodiments one or more of the intermediary computers may comprise a client computer. The one or more databases may comprise computer storage on the client computer to hold the client authentication data for the source institution computer system and the client authentication data for the one or more destination institution computer systems. In embodiments accessing the client authentication data for the source institution computer and or accessing the client authentication data for the one or more destination institution computers may be triggered permitted only by authentication of the client by matching a predetermined security program e.g. an iris scan a fingerprint scan and or a voice sample to data held in the computer storage of the client computer.

In embodiments a further operation of the TMS may comprise associating by the one or more intermediary computers an insurance contract with a user s TMS account to insure against unauthorized transfers from the source account or the one or more destination accounts when the predetermined security program is used to limit access to the client computer. In embodiments a comparison operation may be performed of the amount of the net buy order and an insured amount limit and if the insured amount limit is exceeded then in embodiments the transaction may be automatically terminated or in embodiments an electronic notification may be sent to the client that the amount of the buy order exceed the insurance limit.

In embodiments the client authentication data for the source institution computer of a source institution and the client authentication data for the one or more destination institution computers of one or more destination institutions may limit authorization only to transfers between client accounts associated with the source institution computers and the destination institution computers and no other transfers e.g. no transfers to accounts not associated with the client or not registered with the TMS as such . An interface may be provided to insert this transfer limitation into any transfer instructions. In embodiments it may be a default setting. Accordingly the process may further comprise generating and or verifying compliance with electronic transaction authorization rules.

In embodiments the process may further comprise triggering an association by the one or more computers of an insurance contract to insure against unauthorized transfers from the source account or the one or more destination accounts to a fund transfer when the limited authorization for fund transfers is activated.

In embodiments the electronic authorization from the client is utilized along with their passwords and appropriate identification to retrieve source account e.g. brokerage account information and destination account e.g. cash management account information on a timely basis to move funds back and forth as needed to cover a trade and or to maximize yield or maximize interest on a cash management account by directing the movement of funds among accounts across institutions while bypassing inactivating the automatic fund transfer programs of clearing firm computers and or source institution computers and or destination institution computers and the attendant processing time and or expense at the computer systems of the clearing firms the source institutions and the destination institutions.

When a retail client provides their identification information and access information to the service provider associated with the TMS the service provider may access data directly from the computer systems of the brokerage money and or cash management providers. If the computer systems cannot be accessed directly the service provider e.g. via the TMS can use screen scraping or any other similar technology to access the respective clients account at the brokerage firm and or at the cash management provider to retrieve appropriate account information. This account information may then be uploaded into a software program that determines an amount of money to be moved from which account and into which account but bypassing inactivating any the automatic fund transfer programs of clearing firm computers and or source institution computers and or destination institution computers. The result of this automatic fund transfer bypass operation is that the client may be able to achieve a higher interest rate or yield on its cash management investments that are connected to the brokerage account and may eliminate attendant processing.

In embodiments sweep notifications may be provided to indicate that a sweep transaction occurred. Such sweep notifications may include balance information such as post sweep balances at one or more institutions and or pre sweep balances.

In embodiments the security systems methods and program products described herein may be applied to non sweep processes to provide secure authorization e.g. for electronic messages and or to provide data security. The present invention is an improvement over the prior art security systems and methods that require either pure biometric signatures or storage of user credentials such as reference credentials e.g. user passwords PINs biometric data security questions and or corresponding answers to name a few and as such the technological improvement can have far reaching applications to enhance data security message authentication and or data transmission security.

The secure enclave processor core may comprise non transitory computer readable memory having stored thereon one or more software modules configured to run on the secure enclave processor core . Such modules can include a biometric data processing module a private key generation module an encryption module and or a secure data deletion module . In embodiments the non transitory computer readable memory may store e.g. during processing sensitive data such as password information biometric data and or private keys.

A biometric data processing module may apply one or more algorithms such as wavelet transformations Fourier Mellin transformations other integral transformations log polar transformations filtering e.g. high pass and or low pass filtering encoding e.g. base 36 encoding and or other operations to transform and or convert received biometric data. The biometric data processing module may extract second biometric data from the received biometric data where the second biometric data is designed to be unique to a user but able to be replicated from each of multiple instances of user specific biometric data. In embodiments the biometric data processing module may generate a feature vector from the biometric data which may be an invariant feature vector. In embodiments the module may generate a coding of the invariant feature vector such as a 128 bit code which may be designed to be an invariant code. In embodiments additional input information such as a PIN may be used in the generation of an invariant feature vector or corresponding code e.g. to increase the variation in output from one user to the next.

A private key generation module may generate a private key e.g. based at least in part upon the biometric data. The private key generation module may also use a password or PIN number in generating the private key. The private key may be used in a public key or asymmetric key cryptography security system. In embodiments the private key generation module may also generate a public key corresponding to the private key. The public key may be generated upon the first generation of the private key and the public key may be stored on the user electronic device or transmitted to one or more other entities such as a deposit sweep computer system or other cash sweep computer system. A public key may represent non secure information that can be used to verify the validity of generated private keys that should correspond thereto. Accordingly a public key stored on the user electronic device may be used to determine at the device a user s authorization to use the device or to engage in one or more secure transactions or operations. In embodiments a public key stored on the user electronic device may be used to determine whether a correct private key was generated e.g. prior to using the private key to encrypt an electronic message. A public key stored at a remote computer system may be used to confirm authorization for received electronic requests signed using the private key e.g. so as to generate a digital signature.

An encryption module may use the generated private key to encrypt one or more electronic messages and or to provide an indication of authenticity of one or more electronic messages such as by providing a digital signature based at least in part upon the private key. In embodiments the encryption process may comprise hashing an electronic message payload to produce a message digest and encrypting the message digest using the private key which functions as a private signing key. The encrypted message digest may comprise a digital signature. The encrypted message may be decrypted and or the digital signature may be verified using a corresponding public key which functions as a public verification key.

A secure data deletion module may delete from any memory devices of the client device and more specifically any non transitory computer readable memory within the secure enclave processor core any secure information such as a user password biometric data processed biometric data e.g. biometric images or versions thereof that were generated using one or more algorithms and or private key data. The secure data deletion module may perform multiple delete and or overwrite operations to ensure that even partial copies of sensitive data do not remain in memory.

A normal processor core may run other software modules used by a client device which can include a message generation module and a communications module . A client device may comprise one or more normal processor cores .

A message generation module may generate one or more electronic messages which can comprise user requests user instructions and or user information. The messages may be unencrypted when generated. Such electronic messages may be configured to be transmitted via a communications network such as a data network. Accordingly messages may be transmitted as one or more data packets.

A communications module may be configured to send and or receive electronic messages data and or data packets. Such messages can comprise push notifications alerts emails and or SMS messages to name a few. The communications module may transmit one or more electronic messages which may be unencrypted or encrypted to one or more user electronic devices or computer systems. The communications module may use hardware and or software that comprise a communications portal as described herein.

The figure illustrates exemplary data pathways e.g. among software modules. The data pathways may comprise computer readable instructions to transmit data from one module or device to another and or to fetch data from a particular module or device. In embodiments certain data pathways may comprise hardware components such as wire e.g. copper wire circuitry printed circuitry and or hardware sockets and plugs. Multiple data types may flow along a given hardware pathway. For example a single hardware connection between the normal processor core and the secure enclave processor core may allow electronic messages targeted for encryption to be sent from the normal processor core e.g. from the message generation module to the encryption module and may allow encrypted electronic messages to be sent from the encryption module to the normal processor core e.g. to the communication module . In other embodiments a plurality of hardware connections which may be dedicated pathways may be employed.

As shown in user credential information such as a user password PIN and or username may be input into the biometric data processing module from an input device . In embodiments an intermediate input device processing module may receive data from the input device and pass it to the biometric data processing module . Biometric data such as a biometric image or other biometric reading data may be input into the biometric data processing module from a biometric reader device such as fingerprint scanner . The biometric data processing module may generate an invariant feature vector based at least in part upon the input biometric data and or the input user credential information.

The feature vector may be passed from the biometric data processing module to the private key generation module . In embodiments user credential information may also be passed from the biometric data processing module to the private key generation module . In other embodiments the user credential information may be passed to the private key generation module from the input device or from an intermediate input device processing module. The private key generation module may generate an invariant asymmetric private key which it may pass to the encryption module .

The encryption module may use the private key to encrypt or digitally sign an electronic message received from the message generation module . The encrypted or signed electronic message may then be provided to the communication module from the encryption module.

The biometric data processing module may pass the invariant code to a private key generation module . The biometric data processing module may also pass the user password to the module although in embodiments the private key generation module may obtain the password from the input device . The private key generation module may perform step S to generate an asymmetric private key. The private key generation module may pass the private key to an encryption module . The encryption module may obtain a message targeted for encryption or digital signature e.g. from a message generation module . In embodiments the electronic message targeted for encryption or digital signature may be initially unencrypted. In other embodiments it may already be encrypted using encryption techniques that do not involve the private key. The encryption module may encrypt or digitally sign the electronic message by performing step S. The encryption module may pass the encrypted or digitally signed electronic message to a communications module which may transmit the encrypted or digitally signed electronic message to other devices and or computer systems in a step S. A secure data deletion module may execute step S to remove sensitive data such as the user password input biometric data processed biometric data private key and or encrypted or signed electronic message from the memory devices of the client device .

This secure data authentication system and processes eliminate the need to store secure data at all whether locally on the client device or remotely such as on computer servers. Encryption or digital signature is provided using a private asymmetric key which is regenerated either each instance it is needed or for each user session. User sessions may time out after a particular period of time and or the secure data deletion module may be configured to delete any sensitive data after a predefined period of time.

Unlike security systems in the prior art the system and processes of the present invention do not store reference user credentials or reference biometric data to be matched against user credentials or biometric data that is input for authentication of a user or a user electronic request. Instead encrypted or digitally signed electronic messages may be verified using a public key corresponding to the private key that functioned as the signing key. The public key is not sensitive data or is less sensitive than user credential information and user biometric data. Accordingly the public key may be stored locally on the client device and or on remote servers e.g. in non transitory computer readable memory operatively connected thereto which remote servers may comprise a cash sweep computer system which may be a deposit sweep computer system. Any illicit or accidental access to the public key cannot result in an unauthorized transfer. Meanwhile the private key only exists within the secure enclave processor core and only for a limited period of time e.g. during the pendency of the encryption operations or a user session. The private key cannot be extracted from the secure enclave processor core due to limited hardware data pathways and or software barriers to extraction. These aspects of the security system of the present invention provide key advantages over prior art security systems.

The secure data authentication system and processes of the present invention further improve on prior art public key cryptography systems that seek to introduce entropy into private key generation to decrease the probability of regeneration of the private key. Prior art private keys must be stored e.g. in a security token device in a computer file memorized and or written down to name a few. Stored private keys are susceptible to loss theft and or accidental disclosure. The present invention provides technical mechanisms for regenerating a private key based at least in part upon biometric data which eliminates the need to store the private key. An invariant replicable unique representation of a user s biometric data is generated from the input biometric data. That invariant representation is then used to generate a private key. The invariant feature extraction processes and or the private key generation process may be further based at least in part upon user password information such as a numeric passcode or PIN. Accordingly a user may regenerate a private key as needed to authenticate an electronic request or to provide other authentication.

Referring to in a step S a mobile device may receive a user password via a graphical user interface rendered on the mobile device. The mobile device may be a client device as described herein such as a cell phone smart phone personal digital assistant or tablet computer to name a few. The graphical user interface may be a login interface or other interface with rendered user credential input elements. The user password may be input using a user input device such as a keyboard keypad touch screen touchpad pointer device mouse or microphone to name a few. The user password may be a series of digits such as a numeric passcode or personal identification number which defines a number. In embodiments the user password may be an alphanumeric sequence. An alphanumeric sequence may be encoded to convert it to a numeric sequence. In embodiments an alphanumeric user password may be converted to binary data using base 36 encoding.

In a step S the mobile device may capture into a secure enclave processor core of the mobile device using a biometric reader embedded in the mobile device a first digital biometric image of a biometric reading of a user. The biometric reader may be a scanner such as a fingerprint scanner hand or palm scanner retinal scanner iris scanner blood sampler or voice scanner to name a few. In embodiments the biometric reader may be a capacitive scanner e.g. a capacitive fingerprint scanner that can use electrical current to determine ridges and valleys e.g. based at least in part upon detected voltage outputs. In embodiments the biometric reader may be an optical scanner that can use light e.g. emitted from a diode and measure the intensity of reflection e.g. to determine distances to surface points and or elevations thereof. The secure enclave processor core may only be accessible to input passwords digital biometric image data and electronic messages targeted for encryption or digital signature and further accessible to receive outputs of encrypted or digitally signed electronic messages and public keys configured to verify the authenticity of encrypted electronic messages.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may convert the first digital biometric image into an invariant biometric feature vector using an integrated wavelet and Fourier Mellin transformation process. An exemplary particular process by which the invariant biometric feature vector may be generated is illustrated in described herein.

In embodiments e.g. prior to converting the first digital biometric image in the invariant biometric feature vector the secure enclave processor core may convert the first digital biometric image into a distorted first digital biometric image which may comprise a sixth digital biometric image. To do so the secure enclave processor core may apply a distortion to the first digital biometric image such as by applying a distortion algorithm which may produce a radial distortion such as a barrel distortion e.g. fisheye distortion pincushion distortion or mustache distortion. The distortion may be based at least in part upon the user password. For example the user password may be used to select a particular distortion algorithm e.g. from a predefined set of distortion algorithms or parameters therefor. Accordingly a numeric value may be derived from the user password e.g. via encoding and or by treating a numeric passcode as a number and used e.g. in conjunction with logical programming rules to select an algorithm and or set algorithm parameters. In embodiments the user password may provide an input to a distortion algorithm to indicate a center of distortion e.g. by selecting a location such as a pixel location associated with the center of distortion which location may be based at least in part upon the numeric value derived from the user password. The sixth digital biometric image produced using the distortion algorithm may be converted into an invariant biometric feature vector in place of the first digital biometric image using the process described in .

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may convert the invariant feature vector using the user password into a 128 bit invariant code. In embodiments the invariant code may be a binary series. Although the process is described with respect to a 128 bit code in embodiments other bit counts may be used e.g. 64 bits 256 bits 512 bits 1024 bits 2048 bits 4096 bits to name a few. The invariant code may provide a seed for generation of a private key. An exemplary process for generating the invariant code from the invariant biometric feature vector is illustrated in described herein.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may generate an invariant asymmetric private key using the 128 bit invariant code. In embodiments the secure enclave processor core may also use the user password to generate the private key. In embodiments a key generation algorithm such as an RSA algorithm or a Digital Signature Algorithm DSA e.g. as described by the FIPS 186 3 standard or the FIPS 186 4 standard may be used to generate the private key. In embodiments the invariant code may comprise a seed input into a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator the output of which may be processed by an RSA or other key generation algorithm. In embodiments the user password may be used to modify the invariant code such as by using the user password to cipher the invariant code e.g. to offset the invariant code or the digits thereof as a multiplier of the invariant code or the digits thereof and or to prepend insert or append the user password to the invariant code e.g. optionally first converting the password to binary . The modification of the invariant code may be made prior to input of the modified invariant code into a key generation algorithm.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply the invariant asymmetric private key to an electronic message associated with a cash sweep transaction which may be a deposit sweep transaction to generate a digitally signed electronic message comprising a message payload and digital signature to be securely transmitted to a second device associated with the sweep transaction. In embodiments the second device may be any of a sweep computer system e.g. a deposit sweep computer system a source institution computer system a depository institution computer system or another destination institution computer system e.g. an ETF computer system or money fund computer system to name a few . In embodiments the message payload may comprise a request to perform a particular sweep operation user information such as account credentials associated with sweep operations and or authorization to perform a particular sweep operation which may be a cash sweep operation such as a deposit sweep operation or a sweep involving non depository accounts such as ETFs money funds stable value funds or capital investment plans to name a few. The digital signature may be generated using the invariant asymmetric private key with a public key cryptography algorithm. For example the secure enclave processor core may hash the message payload to produce a message digest and then may encrypt the message digest using the invariant asymmetric private key.

Applying the invariant asymmetric private key to an electronic message can comprise receiving at the secure enclave processor core from a normal processor core the electronic message. The secure enclave processor core may then evaluate the electronic message e.g. to verify the message data format which may be a protection against introducing malicious code into the secure enclave processor core. The secure enclave processor core may then generate a message digest by computing a hash of the message payload and then may encrypt the message digest using the invariant asymmetric private key.

In a step S the mobile device may securely transmit to the second device the digitally signed electronic message causing the sweep transaction to be initiated upon successful verification of the digital signature using a corresponding public key previously provided to the second device wherein the corresponding public key corresponds to the invariant asymmetric private key. In embodiments the public key may be generated upon the first generation of a private key and then provide to other devices such as the second device. In embodiments a copy of the public key may be maintained at the mobile device e.g. stored in non transitory computer readable memory. The mobile device may use such a stored public key to verify subsequent instances of generation of the private key to ensure the private key was generated accurately prior to signing electronic messages with it.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may permanently delete the user password the first digital biometric image the second digital biometric image the third digital biometric image the fourth digital biometric image the fifth digital biometric image the first set of feature data the invariant biometric feature vector the invariant asymmetric private key and the 128 bit invariant code.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply a wavelet transformation to the first digital biometric image to generate a second digital biometric image. In embodiments a discrete wavelet transformation may be applied.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply a fast Fourier transform to the second digital biometric image to generate a third digital biometric image. The third digital biometric image may thus be a representation of the second digital biometric image in the frequency domain.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply a log polar transformation to the third digital biometric image to generate a fourth digital biometric image. A representation of the third biometric image using log polar coordinates may be used to adjust for rotational variations in the input biometric data e.g. if a fingerprint was scanned at a rotated angle and or to adjust for differences in scale e.g. if the scanned sample was closer or farther from the biometric reader such as if a finger was pressed firmly against the reader instead of being held a short distance away.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply a high pass filter to the fourth digital biometric image to generate a fifth digital biometric image. The high pass filter may reduce noise in the image data. The filter may eliminate image data with values below a predefined threshold value.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply a fast Fourier transform to the fifth digital biometric image to generate a first set of feature data. In embodiments the feature data may comprise a series of values.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply row concatenation to the first set of feature data to generate an invariant biometric feature vector.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may generate using the user password a threshold intensity value. In embodiments the threshold intensity value may be scaled or normalized within a predefined intensity range. For example a four digit passcode may have 5 040 permutations in the range 0000 to 9999. A user password that is a four digit passcode may be scaled from that range to a scaled range such as 0 to 255 which range may correspond to possible image intensity values. In embodiments the user password may be normalized within the range of values of the invariant feature vector elements or within the range of permissible values of the invariant feature vector elements. The normalized user password may then be used as a threshold intensity value.

Accordingly generating the threshold intensity value may comprise obtaining a numeric value from the user password e.g. by treating an input numeric sequence as a number or by encoding an alphanumeric sequence and then normalizing that numeric value within a predefined intensity range of possible intensity values by scaling the numeric value based at least in part upon a relation between a range of possible numeric values and the predefined intensity range.

In a step S the secure enclave processor core may apply the threshold intensity value to the invariant feature vector to generate an invariant code such as a 128 bit invariant code. If an element of the invariant feature vector is less than the threshold intensity value the corresponding element in the invariant code may be assigned a value of zero. If the element of the invariant feature vector equals or exceeds the threshold intensity value the corresponding element in the invariant code may be assigned a value of one. In embodiments the zeros may be assigned to elements greater than the threshold intensity value while the ones may be assigned to elements less than or equal to the threshold intensity value. The resulting invariant code may be a series or vector of ones and or zeros.

In embodiments applying the threshold intensity value to the invariant feature vector to generate the 128 bit invariant code can comprise generating using the threshold intensity value a sequence of real numbers comprising a set of pseudo random vectors. The secure enclave processor core may then apply a Gram Schmidt ortho normalization to the set of pseudo random vectors to transform them into an orthonormal set of vectors. In embodiments the secure enclave processor core may normalize the invariant biometric feature vector e.g. between the values negative one and positive one. The secure enclave processor core may compute an inner product between the invariant biometric feature vector and the orthonormal set of vectors. For each inner product value less than the threshold intensity value the secure enclave processor core may assign a value of zero to a corresponding element position in a binary vector and for each inner product value greater than the threshold intensity value the secure enclave processor core may assign a value of one. Accordingly the secure enclave processor core may map each assigned value to a bit location based at least in part upon the element location within the biometric feature vector. In embodiments element locations with the biometric feature vector may have been determined using a log polar transformation. In embodiments the secure enclave processor core may aggregate the values in their respective locations to produce a bit string. As such the secure enclave processor core constructs an ordered sequence of zeros and or ones based at least in part upon a comparison of the biometric feature vector element values to the threshold intensity value and a mapping of the element location to a location in the ordered sequence which is the bit string.

In embodiments a particular type of feature vector known as FingerCode may be generated as an alternative to step S. FingerCode generation is described in Dario Maio Loris Nanni Neurocomputing 68 2005 208 216 and in A. K. Jain et al. IEEE Trans. Image Process. 5 9 2000 846 859 which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Accordingly a biometric image is input to a FingerCode feature extraction process. The biometric digital image may be preprocessed e.g. filtered to reduce noise and or increase contrast. Then in the feature extraction process a reference point or core point is determined which may be the point of maximum curvature of concave ridges. To determine the reference point the secure enclave processor core may at least divide the biometric image into a grid having any number of rows and columns. Then it may compute a gradient at each pixel of the image. In embodiments it may compute gradients in two perpendicular directions corresponding to the directions of the rows and columns. Then a local orientation may be computed at the center of each cell or sector of the grid to generate an orientation field. The orientation field may be smoothed such as by low pass filtering which may comprise converting the orientation field into a continuous vector field which may be further processed to determine curvature.

Once a core point is determined the digital biometric image may be divided into sectors. illustrate exemplary selection of a core point on a digital biometric image for biometric feature extraction in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention as well as division of the digital biometric image into sectors . illustrate sectors that are bands created using a polar coordinate system while illustrate Cartesian sectors . The digital biometric image may be divided into different numbers of sectors such as 64 128 256 or 512 sectors to name a few. Each sector may correspond to a vector element. In embodiments a plurality of grids may be used and combined to generate a vector for more parameters e.g. two 64 sector grids may be combined to generate a 128 element vector .

In embodiments the core point may be shifted based at least in part upon the user password. For example a numeric passcode may define a translation in the respective coordinate system. Accordingly a passcode numeric value may be scaled to the image boundaries. In embodiments a first portion of a passcode e.g. the first three digits may define a first translation parameter such as a distance along a horizontal axis in the Cartesian system or a distance in the polar system while a second portion of the passcode e.g. the second three digits may define a second translation parameter such as a distance along a vertical axis in the Cartesian system or an angle in the polar system or vice versa to name a few. The superimposed coordinate systems may comprise any number of sectors. In embodiments each sector may be assigned to a position within a vector or array.

A value computed within a respective sector may be assigned to the respective position within the vector. In embodiments values may be normalized between 0 and 9 and or may be binary values. Pixel values within each sector may be normalized. In embodiments one or more filters may be applied to each sector. In embodiments filters such as Gabor filters may be applied in a plurality of directions such as two four or eight directions to name a few. Then an average absolute deviation from the mean grey values in each sector may be computed. The resulting value may be assigned to a vector element position.

In embodiments a system for generating a secure biometric based cryptographic key without storing biometric information in order to authenticate data in a cash sweep e.g. deposit sweep transfer system can comprise one or more processors e.g. of a mobile device and non transitory computer readable memory having stored thereon instructions to perform the steps of receiving via a first graphical user interface on a mobile device a user password capturing using a biometric reader embedded in the mobile device into a secure enclave processor core a first digital biometric image of a biometric reading of a user wherein the secure enclave processor core is only accessible to input passwords digital biometric image data and electronic messages targeted for encryption and to receive from the secure enclave processor core encrypted electronic messages and public keys configured to verify the authenticity of encrypted electronic messages converting by the secure enclave processor core the first digital biometric image into an invariant biometric feature vector using an integrated wavelet and Fourier Mellin transformation process converting by the secure enclave processor core the invariant feature vector using the user password into a 128 bit invariant code generating by the secure enclave processor core an invariant asymmetric private key using the 128 bit invariant code and the user password applying by the secure enclave processor core the invariant asymmetric private key to an electronic message comprising a message payload associated with a cash sweep transaction such as a cash sweep transaction to generate a digitally signed electronic message to be securely transmitted to a second device associated with the sweep e.g. deposit sweep transaction securely transmitting from the mobile device to the second device the digitally signed electronic message causing the sweep transaction to be initiated upon successful verification of the digital signature using a corresponding public key previously provided to the second device wherein the corresponding public key corresponds to the invariant asymmetric private key and permanently deleting from the secure enclave processor core the user password the first digital biometric image the second digital biometric image the third digital biometric image the fourth digital biometric image the fifth digital biometric image the first set of feature data the invariant biometric feature vector the invariant asymmetric private key and the 128 bit invariant code.

In a step S a deposit sweep computer system comprising one or more computers may receive a deposit sweep file for a deposit sweep program. The deposit sweep file may comprise transaction information. In embodiments transaction information can comprise indications of transactions which can include buy amounts sell amounts net transaction amounts transaction fee amounts pre transaction balances and or post transaction balances to name a few. In embodiments the deposit sweep computer system may obtain one or more transaction amounts and may separately obtain one or more account balances. The system may compute post transaction account balances therefrom.

In a step S the deposit sweep computer system may determine based at least in part upon the transaction information allocations of funds for a plurality of customers. The allocations may comprise identifications for each respective customer of one or more respective destination depository institutions and respective amounts to allocate to each respective destination depository institution. In embodiments executing the allocations may comprise updating one or more electronic ledgers. In embodiments executing the allocations may comprise transferring the respective amounts from a first account to a second account.

In a step S the deposit sweep computer system may determine for a first respective customer that at least one of the one or more respective destination depository institutions is a different destination depository institution for the first respective customer. The different destination depository institution may not currently hold customer funds for the deposit sweep program for the first respective customer. In embodiments the deposit sweep computer system may analyze historical transaction and or account data to determine that whether a destination depository institution previously held customer funds. Accordingly the deposit sweep computer system may determine different destination depository institutions that never held funds for the first respective customer or that did not hold such funds within a threshold period of time e.g. 2 months 6 months 1 year 2 years 5 years . In embodiments the deposit sweep computer system may determine different destination depository institutions based at least in part upon a comparison to a previous sweep transaction e.g. the last sweep transaction involving funds of the first respective customer. Any depository institution not included in the previous sweep transaction may be flagged as a different depository institution for the current sweep transaction.

In embodiments the deposit sweep computer system may determine different destination depository institutions that do not currently hold any funds for the first respective customer including funds outside the deposit sweep program e.g. in non program accounts. In embodiments the deposit sweep computer system may use user credentials for the first respective customer to access account information and or otherwise to determine whether any account exists for the first respective customer at the depository institution. Accordingly the deposit sweep computer system may determine that the different destination depository institution does not have an existing account for the first respective customer.
