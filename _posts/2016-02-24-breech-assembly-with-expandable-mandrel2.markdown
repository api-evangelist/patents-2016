title: Breech assembly with expandable mandrel
abstract: A breech assembly for a gun having a barrel and a barrel extension extending rearwardly from the barrel. The barrel extension includes a throughbore aligned with the barrel as well as a radially inwardly extending annular abutment surface adjacent the rear end of the barrel extension. An elongated bolt is axially slidably received through the barrel extension throughbore when moved to a firing position. An expandable mandrel is mounted to the bolt so that the mandrel surrounds at least a portion of the bolt. An expansion pin is slidably mounted on the bolt and movable between a retracted position in which the mandrel collapses onto the bolt and allows removal of the bolt from the barrel extension, and an inserted position in which at least a portion of the expansion pin is inserted into the mandrel and deflects the mandrel radially outwardly so that a rear end of the mandrel abuts against the abutment surface and locks the bolt to the barrel extension.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates generally to firearms and more particularly to a breech assembly for automatic and semiautomatic small arms.

There are many automatic and semiautomatic small arm rifles that are used both in military applications as well as for civilian use. These previously known automatic and semiautomatic weapons include a bolt which reciprocates between a load position and a firing position for each shot that is fired. In its load position the bolt is retracted from the barrel which both ejects the casing from the previously fired cartridge and also allows a new cartridge to be loaded from an ammunition magazine into a load chamber behind the gun breech.

The subsequent forward movement of the bolt to its firing position loads the cartridge into the breech and the bolt is then locked into position. Upon firing of the shot the bolt supports the full load from the firing of the cartridge. After the cartridge has been fired the bolt unlocks and moves to its retracted or load position in which the casing is ejected a new cartridge is loaded into the load chamber behind the breech and the above process is repeated.

Most of today s automatic and semiautomatic rifles use a locking lug style breech to lock the bolt to the rifle when it is fired. In a locking lug style breech the bolt includes a plurality of radial protrusions that are attached to the bolt. These protrusions pass through mating protrusions on the barrel or barrel extension and the locking lugs and the bolt are then rotated to align with the protrusions on the barrel or barrel extension. Given this geometry however the locking lugs can have no more than a 50 load bearing support with the rifle. This in turn requires that the bolt as well as the protrusions in the barrel or barrel extension of the rifle have a minimum size in order to adequately support the load when the rifle is fired.

The present invention provides a breech assembly particularly suited for automatic and semiautomatic small arm guns which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known breech assemblies.

In brief the breech assembly of the present invention includes a breech which is adapted to receive the cartridge to be fired by the gun. Typically the cartridge is received automatically from a magazine which holds the cartridges.

A barrel extension extends longitudinally outwardly from the rear end of the gun barrel. The barrel extension includes a throughbore aligned with the barrel and a radially inwardly extending annular abutment surface adjacent at the rear end of the barrel extension.

An elongated bolt is longitudinally slidably aligned with the barrel extension throughbore. In operation the bolt reciprocates between a retracted or loading position behind the barrel extension to eject a spent casing and receive a new round from the magazine and a forward or firing position in which the bolt extends through the barrel extension and loads a new cartridge into the breech. An elongated and radially expandable mandrel is mounted to the bolt so that the mandrel surrounds at least a portion of the bolt. This mandrel includes a plurality of axially extending slots which extend between the front and rear ends of the mandrel.

An expansion pin is slidably mounted to the bolt and is movable between a retracted or loading position in which the mandrel collapses on the bolt to allow the retraction of the bolt from the barrel extension to the loading position and a firing position in which at least a portion of the expansion pin is inserted into the mandrel and deflects at least the rear end of the mandrel outwardly. In doing so a rear end of the mandrel abuts against the abutment surface formed on the barrel extension thus locking the bolt to the barrel extension to enable firing of the cartridge.

Since the entire rear end of the mandrel abuts against the abutment surface formed in the barrel extension an increased surface of contact between the mandrel and the barrel extension as compared to the previously known lug breech assemblies is effected thus improving the load bearing support and reducing the required size of the bolt.

With reference first to a breech assembly according to the present invention is shown for use with an automatic or semiautomatic rifle including handguns. In the conventional fashion the rifle includes a barrel having an elongated throughbore through which bullets from cartridges are fired. Also in the conventional fashion the cartridges are contained within a magazine and sequentially loaded into a breech as the rifle is fired.

A barrel extension extends rearwardly from the barrel and includes a tapered throughbore aligned with the rifle bore . A radially inwardly extending annular abutment surface is formed adjacent at the rear end of the barrel extension i.e. the end opposite from the rifle bore .

A bolt having an enlarged diameter head and an elongated cylindrical body is reciprocally mounted to the rifle between a loading position shown in and a firing position shown in . In its loading position the bolt is retracted from the barrel extension which both ejects the spent casing and also allows a new cartridge to be loaded in front of the bolt and behind the barrel extension . Thereafter the movement of the bolt to its firing position forces the cartridge through the barrel extension and into the breech in preparation for firing.

With reference now particularly to a mandrel is disposed around the bolt body behind the bolt head . A plurality of circumferentially spaced and axially extending slots are formed through the mandrel and each slot is alternatively open at its front and rear ends and respectively.

The mandrel is formed of a compliant material such as steel so that with the mandrel in an at rest state shown in the mandrel collapses around the bolt body . In doing so the overall diameter of the mandrel is less than the diameter of the throughbore in the barrel extension . Consequently the bolt with the mandrel in its collapsed position may be axially inserted into and removed from the throughbore in the barrel extension .

With reference to in order to lock the bolt to the barrel extension to enable firing of the cartridge loaded in the breech an expansion pin is slidably mounted over a rear end of the bolt body and this expansion pin includes a conical outer surface . Consequently as the expansion pin is moved axially over the bolt body towards the bolt head the outer conical surface of the expansion pin expands the mandrel radially outwardly as shown in . In doing so the rear end of the mandrel is aligned with and abuts against the abutment surface in the barrel extension . With the mandrel and the bolt locked to the barrel extension the cartridge can be fired and the bolt will support the firing load.

In operation with the bolt retracted to its loading position i.e. removed from the barrel extension the previously spent casing is ejected and a new cartridge is loaded into the loading chamber behind the barrel extension . At this time the mandrel is in its collapsed position.

The bolt then shifts longitudinally forwardly to its firing position as shown in thus loading the cartridge into the breech. The expansion pin then shifts forwardly as shown in thus expanding the mandrel and locking the bolt to the barrel extension . The cartridge is then fired with the bolt and mandrel supporting the force or load of the firing. The expansion pin is then moved to its retracted position thereby allowing the mandrel to collapse and the bolt to be retracted to its loading position whereafter the above process is repeated.

From the foregoing it can be seen that since the area of contact between the mandrel and the barrel extension is much greater than 50 the present invention achieves a greater load bearing support than with the previously known breech assemblies with a smaller bolt and smaller breech assembly.

Having described my invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
