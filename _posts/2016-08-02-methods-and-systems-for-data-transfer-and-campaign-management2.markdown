title: Methods and systems for data transfer and campaign management
abstract: An online and offline communication processing and tracking using data processing and data/voice networks is described. A phone address from a phone address number pool is automatically assigned to a first entity. A call quality rating is determined and recorded. A call from a caller directed to the phone address is received at a call bridging system coupled to at least one network, wherein the call is associated with call signaling information. Based at least in part on the call quality associated with the caller call, the caller call is assigned to a first location in a call queue. An outbound call is generated from the call bridging system and the inbound and the outbound calls are bridged. One or more parameters of the bridged call are compared to the call quality rating. An indication is recorded regarding the successful bridging of the calls in association with an entity identifier.

Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety under 37 CFR 1.57.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the reproduction by any one of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the patent and trademark office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present invention relates to systems and methods for communication tracking and processing and in particular to methods and systems for utilizing ring pools and for tracking and processing phone communications emails and or other correspondence information.

Certain conventional systems provide for on line initiated calls sometimes referred to as click to call . Click to call provides users accessing a web page including an advertisement with a dialogue box which requests the user s phone number and occasionally other information such as name and an affiliate code the user is requested to transcribe from the website. When provided the number is transmitted to the advertiser along with the affiliate s contact information for commission purposes. The advertiser calls the user back and any sale is consummated over the telephone.

The foregoing conventional solution has not been well received by the online advertising community for several reasons. First it is counter intuitive for users to send their phone number to the advertiser when it is the user who wants to call the advertiser. When a user wants to call an advertiser he or she generally wants to pick up his or her phone and actually call the advertiser. He or she doesn t want to send the advertiser his or her number and wait for a call back. Users are also wary of sending their telephone number to an advertiser using these types of dialogue boxes because of online fraud. Also by the time the call is returned the user might have lost interest in buying the product or had already purchased the item elsewhere. When alternative advertising models are considered such as television and newspaper which represent the vast majority of advertising dollars spent the click to call functionality cannot be used. As a result of these deficiencies the click to call mechanism has limited utility.

Although there has been a significant shift in the past decade towards the purchase of goods and services online there are still a number of products purchased over the phone. However many of these over the phone purchases are prompted by advertisements and promotions on the Internet. For media buyers it is difficult to manage and measure the return on their investment for online offline and or mobile advertisements that result in calls. In many cases revenue is lost when a promotion results in a phone call that cannot be tracked back to the media buyer or web property carrying the advertisement.

Currently there are organizations that publish content of interest to an audience of web users. Many of these organizations and distribution partners termed affiliates or publishers generate revenue through advertisements displayed in association with their content. Typically the advertisements on a web page contain only a limited amount of information but link to advertiser web sites that provide further details including a phone number. If a potential customer calls the phone number instead of making the purchase online there are a limited number of tools available to determine which advertisements resulted in that lead. This sales lead tracking and Return On Investment ROI optimization is particularly challenging when there are multiple advertisements displayed on different online advertising channels while the sales transaction takes place in another medium e.g. wireline and wireless telephony . In the case where a single advertisement is associated with a designated phone number and a suitable call tracking solution the ad s performance is clear all calls to the phone number and all sales that resulted from the calls are driven by the aforementioned ad. However it is rare that an advertising campaign only consists of a single ad and that the ad is placed in a single advertising channel. A business with a series of online offline and or mobile promotions e.g. separate media outlets will not likely be able to determine which advertisements were the most effective if all of the advertisements drive calls to one phone number.

Similarly over the past few years the market for the purchase of search keywords has exploded. In this form of advertising a purchased advertisement is included within a result page of a keyword search on a search engine. With these advertisements it is difficult to determine which purchased keywords are the most effective particularly if the transaction takes place in a separate medium e.g. telephony . As with other forms of online offline and or mobile advertisements if multiple keywords are purchased the merchant or affiliate traditionally will not be able to determine which keywords generated a positive return on investment and which did not.

The present invention is also related to marketing and telecommunications and in particular to methods and systems which can be utilized for tracking sales leads optimizing and organizing advertising campaigns where phone calls and optionally phone numbers are used creatively to track and manage ad spending. For example certain embodiments track phone calls driven by each advertisement and associate meaningful values to each call that identify the attributes of the traffic source.

In the embodiment shown in several advertisers and affiliates are registered with more than one affiliate networks which in turn are associated with one or more affiliate network systems .

As shown in the advertiser has the ability to add a new advertising affiliate campaign using the add new campaign module or button control . As shown in in an example embodiment of the new campaign software module the advertiser is presented with a form or a help wizard tool which provides the advertiser with the following submodules overview call pricing target regions call treatment hours target profile keywords and creatives . illustrate example user interface corresponding to these submodules . Fewer additional or different submodules may be used.

With reference to in the overview submodule the advertiser can enter information such as campaign name in a campaign name field network information in a network information field product services or category information in a product services or category field and campaign description in a campaign description field . A campaign name may be used to identify the campaign. Product services or categories enables affiliates to look for campaigns by their type handbags computers legal service etc. Campaign description provides information to affiliate such as information concerning the advertiser the terms and conditions of the advertisement and details about the campaign requested.

In the call pricing submodule the advertiser has the ability to choose either fixed call pricing or a dynamic call pricing e.g. based on call quality . As shown in the embodiment of the advertiser can choose separate prices for high medium and low quality calls. While the specification describes three levels of quality high medium and low different quality labels can be used wherein each label is optionally priced differently. For example quality labels 1 100 can be assigned based on different call criteria. Optionally call quality labels are not assigned. For example the call quality and price can be determined by certain call criteria being achieved during a call. The backend or processing section of the website running on the affiliate network server or the control center server uses a novel method of determining call quality which is discussed in the section relating to submodule . Dynamic call pricing enables advertisers to price calls differently based on specific call criteria e.g. the time of day of the call call length caller responses to interactive voice response menus caller gestures e.g. selection of a specific advertisement spoken keywords etc. Calls can optionally be priced the same or differently for different publishers even if the call criteria is the same. Optionally fixed call pricing is established at a base price per call and bonuses are added on top of the fixed per call price if certain call criteria are met. The call pricing submodule also may comprise a call price calculator which aids the advertiser in determining the call price. By asking the advertiser what percentage of calls are converted into sales and what is the maximum amount of compensation the advertiser is willing to pay see the call price calculator which receives and provides data for display via price calculator user interface can use this information to suggest high medium and low call pricing. Other call price distribution systems such as 1 star 5 star rating are also contemplated. The calculator can use a variety of algorithms to perform this calculation. For example the calculator might set the high call price to be equal to maximum the advertiser is willing to pay . The calculator may determine the medium call price by multiplying the percentage of calls converted into sales by the maximum the advertiser is willing to pay . The calculator may further determine the low call price by halving the medium call price . The determinations can be displayed by the calculator via calculator user interface . Other techniques may be used.

In the target regions submodule the advertiser can restrict the geographic regions from which it wishes to receive calls. Additionally in certain embodiments particular regions within the country ies can be chosen as well. In the embodiment shown in the advertiser can restrict calls to specific regions such as states or specific cities in states time zones . As will be discussed in call treatment submodule the advertiser enters a destination phone number . As described in the campaign application module see the affiliate requests a promotional phone number in some embodiments a toll free phone number from the affiliate network or from the control center . The phone number mapping routine maps the promotional phone number to the destination phone number using the phone number mapping routine in some embodiments the control center s server may include the phone number mapping routine. This routine causes the server to route calls coming into the promotional phone number to the destination phone number . Through this optional mechanism the affiliate network or the control center never actually transfers ownership or control of the origination phone number to the advertiser or affiliate but rather it provides the affiliate with a revocable ability to use the promotional phone number for advertising. In some embodiment the control center may transfer a group of promotion numbers to the affiliate network . Through this mechanism a promotional phone number may be assigned on the internet e.g. to an advertising campaign for a product or service . In some embodiments the promotional phone number can be assigned immediately without intervention by personnel working for the affiliate network or the control center . Optionally the phone number is also activated and ready to receive calls substantially immediately e.g. with 5 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 2 hours . The affiliate network or control center can maintain control over the promotional phone number at all times and can terminate routing the promotional phone number to the destination phone number for whatever reason the affiliate network or the control center may deem necessary.

In the call treatment submodule the advertiser can set how incoming calls to the destination phone number are treated. See . In the single destination routine advertisers can choose to have calls recorded or have SMS marketing messages transmitted to the consumers . An advertiser can setup a promotional code and advertising message to be sent to the consumer s mobile phone Skype phone or computerized phone equipment. This method of generating one or more SMS messages and codes which can be sent to a consumer allows the advertiser to dynamically change the messages sent or codes promoted by simply editing this campaign setting. Additionally the advertiser can send advertisements at a later time such as the next day week or month to increase the number of sales generated. Optionally the SMS messages contain a promotional number which may be called by the user. Additionally in the IVR tree routine an advertiser can set up an IVR system interactive voice system which allows an advertiser to provide customers the ability to operate a voice menu system. In an embodiment of the IVR routine as shown in the advertiser can use the system to route calls made to promotional phone number to different agents. For example in the embodiment show in the consumer can press one to speak with Agent 1 or press two to speak with Agent 2. In some embodiments the sound recognition routine of the backend can be designed to recognize the spoken words one or two in addition to key tones. The text to speech processing routine converts the text shown in text box . Upon pressing one in the embodiment shown in the backend will connect the calling consumer with Agent 1 by bridging the call to Agent 1 s telephone number . Pressing two will bring up a new menu which allows the calling consumer to call either Agent 2 s cell or work phone. The add new route button or hyperlink allows additional options to be created such as a third destination to call Agent 3 for example.

In the hours submodule the advertiser can set the times each day it wishes to receive calls. . Setting the time in this submodule may allow the advertiser to avoid paying affiliate commissions at hours when the advertiser is not in business for example. Moreover this feature may allow the advertiser to route calls to voicemail or to home telephone numbers when the advertiser is closed.

In the target profile submodule the advertiser can set various criteria to be used in the determining whether a customer is high medium or low quality. . The target profile criteria may include subcriteria such as gender age household income marital status education ethnicity and calling from number. Much of the data used to evaluate these subcriteria can be obtained through looking up the consumer phone number against demographic data bases. In the embodiment shown in clicking on the show all field expands all the fields and display the screen shot shown in . In this example embodiment clicking on an individual checkbox expands the particular subcriteria selected. As shown in the advertiser may decide that the gender for example is important in determining whether the particular customer calling is a high medium or low quality caller. For example if the advertiser is selling makeup the advertiser may choose to place the slider high for women and low or none for men. This allows advertisers to communicate to affiliates more effectively about which customers might purchase the advertisers goods and services. In certain embodiments the advertisers may be able use these subcriteria to filter out certain customers completely. In cases such as gender women might be much more likely to purchase an item than men and the advertiser may be willing to pay more for the sales lead if a woman calls as opposed to a man for example. The subcriteria of age household income marital status education ethnicity and calling from may be similarly be used to determine the quality of the consumer.

Advertisers can make use of the call quality of consumers in a variety of ways. First as previously explained advertisers optionally set different payment amounts for high medium and low quality calls. Second advertisers optionally route certain quality calls to their stronger salespersons to increase the likelihood of consummating the sale. Moreover the particular demographic information could be used to pair an appropriate salesperson to the particular customer. For example using available sales statistics the advertiser may decide that a single male in the 25 34 age range would more likely buy products from the advertiser if the agent who answers the call is a single female in the 18 34 age range. Third Advertisers optionally setup their call queuing software to bump higher quality callers up in the queue to reduce the higher quality caller s wait time. Some advertisers use a call queue program to queue customers calls so that customers do not receive voicemail or a busy signal. Rather they are placed in a call queue which allows the advertiser to answer the caller as soon as an agent is made available.

In the keywords submodule advertiser can also specify certain keywords that the backend sound recognition routine can identify for the purpose of rating calls. Certain keywords such as competitor names product names or types can be identified to establish the quality of the caller. Similarly the utterance of certain words by the consumer may establish dissatisfaction with the product advertiser or agent. In some embodiments the sound recognition routine can distinguish between the voice of the consumer and that of the advertiser either by sound or by receiving information relating to the source of the sound i.e. from which phone number call leg the voice is received. In the embodiment just described the keywords submodule determines call quality during and after the call from the consumer is made and the target profile submodule can begin determining call quality once the consumer calls the advertiser .

In the creatives submodule the advertiser can upload a creative such as an image or a banner for use by the affiliate in campaigning for the advertiser . As explained later in the section discussing the creative module the affiliate may have the option to add the promotional phone number to this creative to improve the affiliate s promotional ability. The done button can be selected to save the entered information into the campaign. Similarly when editing the campaign the done button saves the changes made to the campaign .

In certain embodiments users of the software platform may be able to utilize call voice and fax quality techniques to improve their advertising experience. Accurately determining call quality may be useful for the advertiser as it may provide the advertiser with a way of rewarding the affiliate with additional compensation for good quality calls while at the same time allowing the advertiser to avoid paying high commission fees for lower quality calls. Through adjusting the various target profile subcriteria in the target profile submodule the advertiser may enable the software platform to determine demographic information about the customer . In the embodiment shown in the advertiser can adjust sliders to increase the weight associated with the customer having certain demographic subcriteria but alternate methods of saving this information optionally might be used. Additionally the advertiser can use the keyword submodule to enable the software platform to determine the quality of the call. When customers consumers or advertisers use these keywords the software platform can monitor or record their enunciation and appropriately raise the quality of the call. In some embodiments the software platform might utilize algorithms to adjust the significance of the utterance of the keyword based upon the syntax position in the sentence voice modulation is the keyword stressed in the sentence repetition variants of the keyword ice skating vs. ice skates for example or use of synonyms for the keyword. The software platform may also suggest possible keywords or check the spelling of keywords. Through analyzing the various scores generated through the target profile information and the keyword information the backend of the software platform can assign a quality rating to the call.

In certain embodiments affiliates may be informed of the various subcriteria and keywords set in the campaign and in other embodiments this information may be kept from the affiliate . In embodiments where this information is disclosed the affiliate can use the information to modify how the advertiser s goods and services are marketed. Another benefit of the call quality feature in certain embodiments is that it may reward those affiliates that provide advertisers with better customer leads or more sales while placing a disincentive to the affiliate to provide the advertiser with lower quality calls.

Once the affiliate clicks the agree button the advertiser will be notified that an affiliate has applied to the campaign via the notification module . To accept or reject the application the advertiser can click on the application notice see for example . Clicking on the notice causes the server of the affiliate network system or the control center to initiate the acceptance module . Through the acceptance module the advertiser can choose to accept or deny the affiliate s application to the campaign .

In some embodiments of the present invention an emphasis may be placed on ensuring that customer consumer the potential buyer of the advertiser s goods or services does not need to be at all aware of the entire software platform used to reward the affiliate who brought the customer to the advertiser s corporate website . There are several ways an affiliate may induce a customer to visit an advertiser s website . In some embodiments an affiliate might broadcast an email or SMS place an outbound call voice or fax or publish a website magazine or newspaper whose subject matter interests the reader. Magazines newspapers flyers or television commercials might list the promotional phone number or email address of the advertiser in the advertisement. Affiliates might provide click through advertisements which also include a copy of the promotional phone number or email address on the advertisement. URL links or creatives may also be placed on these websites and publications to an advertiser s web site. A URL is the complete or incomplete website listing such as http www.retailer.com. Links can be hypertext or pictures which when clicked send a command to the customer s web browser to change the current page the customer s web browser is viewing. Creatives made through the creative module are pictures or images that the advertiser would like the affiliate to use in marketing its products or services. In some embodiments the affiliate can link the promotional phone number with the creative by using the creative modification submodule see . The promotional phone number may be linked by embedding the number into the meta data or filename of the creative physically editing the image of the creative to display the promotional phone number or appending the promotional phone number to the top side or bottom of the creative . Either the customer dials the promotional phone number from the creative or clicks on the URL link or creative which causes the customer s web browser to display the advertiser s website or initiate a call to a promotional number.

Ordinarily when the customer s web browser switches to the advertiser s website the advertiser s contact information is displayed prominently on the website so that if the customer decides to call the advertiser instead of buying online the referral by the affiliate is lost. To overcome this problem an embodiment may be designed so that the link URL or creative passes an affiliate information object to the advertiser s website . This affiliate information object may contain a variety of information which can be customized though the link customization submodule described above. When this type of information is passed to the advertiser s website the advertiser s website can determine which affiliate caused the customer to visit the advertiser s website . The advertiser s website then executes a contact information modulation routine optionally downloaded from the system which causes the website to display the promotional phone number selected by the affiliate . Thus if the customer calls the promotional phone number listed on the advertiser s website the number is routed through an affiliate network or control center and the affiliate is given proper credit for the referral. The contact information modulation routine may be embodied as a software package optionally downloaded from the system that causes the contact information on the advertiser s webpage to change from their default values to a value specified by the affiliate information object.

In some embodiments of the present invention the contact information modulation routine may also validate the affiliate s account information with the affiliate network or the control center . Advertisers may wish to validate the affiliate s account before paying commissions to make sure the campaign is still active and that affiliate is authorized to charge the advertiser for referrals.

Optionally the stored data can be used in marketing campaigns to improve customer prospect targeting and the efficacy of the campaign examples of implicit and explicit data collection are further described in the marketing automation section below . Optionally the stored data can be used in retargeting marketing campaigns.

The ANCB system in this example contains a phone server subsystem with call and fax processing and call bridging capabilities. Optionally the servers bridge calls between users advertisers e.g. advertiser s call center and or third parties e.g. an outsourced call center . User calls optionally are received by inbound or originated from outbound the phone server subsystem . Additionally advertiser third party calls are received by inbound or originated from outbound the phone server subsystem . For example a call center agent places a call to the phone server subsystem and the phone server subsystem originates an outbound call to a user who expressed an interest in a product or service or in response to a gesture on a web page e.g. click to call . These servers optionally provide interactive voice response voice messaging voice recognition text to speech services fax server features and voice message transcription to natural language text. Optionally the phone server s services e.g. text to speech utilized in a call are configurable e.g. a specific interactive voice response tree or sub menu and may be determined based on attributes of the caller or called party or other call quality criteria e.g. time of day terminal device of caller or called party etc. .

The ANCB system in this example contains a web server and general purpose server subsystem with web serving and general computing capabilities.

The ANCB system in this example optionally interfaces with e.g. over a data network with one or more external web servers including an Advertiser Web Server. Optionally the ANCB web server s host one or more web pages of publishers and or advertisers. Optionally the system redirects users to an Advertiser s Web Server . Optionally the system redirects consumers users to an Advertiser s Web Server where the redirect includes one or more phone addresses from a phone number pool.

In this example the ANCB system servers and are optionally centralized at a given location or distributed to a number of locations. The ANCB system can be implemented as a standalone system e.g. an ANCB system used by a number of service providers or the ANCB system can be integrated into a service provider s internal systems e.g. an affiliate network . Optionally the ANCB system is connected to a data communication network and a wireline wireless network . The ANCB system interconnects with the wireline wireless network using telecommunication interfaces e.g. SS7 and via data communication networks using a secure router subsystem and an SMS server subsystem which optionally serves as a mail relay to transmit and receive SMS and MMS messages via a Short Message Service Center e.g. an SMSC operated by a network carrier .

As discussed above there is a need to manage and track the sales leads and conversion to purchase associated with advertisements. Certain example embodiments of a performance marketing PM system described herein enable a business to track phone based sales through unique call processing techniques number allocation number pooling web user interfaces and reporting. In addition certain embodiments of the PM system can perform certain call enhancements e.g. interactive voice response call filtering etc. help manage call volumes and or calculate affiliate publisher payments.

Generally unique promotional telephone numbers or other types of unique contact addresses may be used to track performance across multiple media outlets. By utilizing unique phone numbers or other contact addresses the PM system tracks the potential customer s experience from the initial advertisement to conversion specific to a designated media outlet . For online offline and or mobile advertisements a deeper level of tracking is available. By associating custom tracking parameter values that distinguish the attributes of the traffic source to the call itself the user can then easily determine tracking granularity down to the individual advertisement level. This method of online offline and or mobile tracking can be applied to for example search engine marketing or any online ad placements. In order to function at a large scale accommodating thousands of simultaneous users entire pools or groups of numbers termed RingPools are allocated to a specific online offline and or mobile media outlet e.g. paid search keywords .

The RingPool phone number acts as a middle man joining the ad and its attributes to the call. The association of the RingPool phone number and the advertisement e.g. a paid search ad occurs dynamically at the time the advertisement is rendered for display to a web surfer consumer. When a user clicks on an ad a RingPool phone number is assigned e.g. dynamically assigned so that when the number is called the ad s attributes are collected. Upon completion the call is reported in association with these attributes.

The performance marketing PM system phone number pool RingPool optionally includes toll free numbers long distance and local phone numbers. Optionally the phone number pool includes phone numbers with extensions. Optionally phone calls to the phone numbers can be domestic or international and can include landline mobile and VoIP numbers or other contact addresses. Optionally phone calls to the numbers within the pool route through the PM system and terminate in various networks including landline mobile and VoIP networks. Optionally the routed calls terminate in businesses e.g. call centers and or to one or more user devices e.g. wireline or mobile devices .

Tracking a large quantity of phone numbers can be cumbersome cost ineffective and inefficient. RingPools are designed to allow for robust tracking over vast quantities of advertisements without requiring a 1 1 ratio of telephone numbers to advertisements. The PM system automatically and efficiently determines lifespan of the association between the ad and the RingPool number by factoring in average number of clicks and the average time a user stays on site although human intervention may be used as well .

Optionally phone numbers are only recycled reused after all of the RingPool numbers have been used in order to maintain the association as long as possible and optionally the PM system only breaks the join association between the number and the advertisement keyword after the configurable specified lifespan has expired. Optionally the hierarchy of numbers used in the recycling process is determined by the amount of activity. Phone numbers with the least amount of activity e.g. call activity are recycled first while the most popular advertisements and number pairings are preserved. Once a certain amount e.g. all of the numbers within a pool have been used and the assigned minimum time has not been exceeded the PM system selects a number which is designated within the number pool to serve as an overflow number. An aspect of the overflow number is that the call still goes through to the correct advertiser but the fact that it s coming in through the overflow number alerts advertisers e.g. campaign managers to the fact that they re out of numbers.

Optionally phone numbers are not actually allocated to the pool until needed. So for example a pool of 250 numbers might only contain 100 actual phone numbers that were assigned for tracking at that instant the remaining 150 slots in the pool of 250 would not be filled with actual phone numbers until later and or when they are needed. This allows more efficient use of phone numbers in aggregate since not all pools in the system will have reached their full potential size at any given time.

When the number pool is exhausted an alarm and or notification e.g. provided via a Web page an instant message e.g. SMS MMS an email a phone call or otherwise is optionally triggered alerting the user e.g. a campaign manager to increase the size of the RingPool. Optionally the PM system uses other number recycling activity based techniques including but not limited to round robin last in first out first in last out highest activity lowest activity and or other weighted distribution methods. Optionally the PM system can be configured to maintain the number association during the life of the campaign even if the available numbers within a pool exhausts e.g. by configuring the lifespan of the join to exceed the length of the ad campaign . Optionally the PM system determines using one or more number usage techniques if a RingPool is provisioned with an excess quantity of numbers e.g. if one or a group of numbers have never been used over a configurable period of time or if only a certain percentage of numbers within the number pool have been used over a configurable period of time . Excess numbers phone addresses can be removed from the RingPool and made available to other RingPools. Optionally numbers from a terminated RingPool are placed in an idle or reserved state for either a configurable period of time e.g. 30 days until the number of calls to the idle numbers falls below a configurable threshold or other idle period management technique. Optionally the PM system plays a reserved state audible prompt when a call is placed to a reserved state number e.g. an out of service message . Optionally the PM system delivers the call to a configured call center destination e.g. as an alternative to and or in addition to playing an out of service message and a party e.g. the PM system provider may receive monetary compensation for delivering the call.

Optionally the PM system provides a collection of detailed reports on calls for each advertisement and with the specific keyword or other parameters used to track it. Optionally the PM system also provides the search engine and search string used when keywords are tracked.

The PM system manages the phone number allocation call enhancements and affiliate publisher call tracking over the course of an advertiser s campaign. There are several types of example campaigns and different combination of example campaigns described below. Campaign types may include but are not limited to direct advertising a campaign supported by the PM system but not promoted by affiliates publishers regular pay per call phone based ad campaign promoted by affiliates publishers Cost Per Acquisition CPA phone based ad campaign promoted by affiliates publishers in which payouts are based upon whether the call resulted in a sale RingOut outbound phone based ad campaign in which calls are placed to consumers. The PM system also supports pay per call campaigns in which a Network manager organizes and manages one or more campaigns on behalf of one or more advertisers. Further the system supports bundled campaigns in which a user e.g. a Network manager of multiple campaigns provides publishers and affiliates access to more than one ad campaign that share a common theme or vertical e.g. insurance and the user configures the allocation of incoming calls e.g. calls generated by publishers and affiliates across the bundle of advertiser campaigns. Optionally the PM system further supports syndicated campaigns where calls cascade from one network advertiser or publisher to another. The calls may optionally be connected using the public telephone network. In a preferred embodiment the audio or fax data streams are directly routed by the platform between the final end points thus eliminating telecom costs for the intermediate call legs and also increasing audio or fax data quality since there is no additional voice packet delay for the syndicated call legs. The platform can manage payouts and track payout qualifications such as across networks where it would not be feasible or cost effective for disparate systems to do so. Syndicated campaigns include ad campaigns syndicated or made available to one or more Networks described in further detail below .

Advertisers can also set up campaigns where certain target budgets are established for a campaign and or time periods within a campaign. Optionally an advertiser may restrict the number of calls for a specified budget e.g. threshold dollar amount and or for a given period e.g. a daily call cap budget . Optionally specified budget allocations can be reset daily weekly monthly or with budget replenishment. Warning notifications and confirmation notifications are optionally automatically sent to the campaign manager and calls that exceed threshold caps may get blocked e.g. with an announcement message or re routed until the specified reset replenishment occurs.

Optionally a type of RingPool is made available to loyalty providers. Loyalty providers reward their customers who purchase certain goods and services with a currency which can be cashed in by calling the provider s call center agents or by a customer accessing the provider s web site. Conventionally it is challenging to track and reward loyalty members when they purchase a good or service by placing a phone call.

Loyalty providers use an identifier to track each of their members. The loyalty provider can put the loyalty identifier into a RingPool parameter and optionally other information of interest for tracking in additional RingPool parameters. When the member calls the RingPool number that has been assigned to them the PM system is able to track the action so they receive proper credit for it in the loyalty program.

Optionally the RingPools configuration process described below can be simplified by having the PM system automatically or by default prompt loyalty member for their loyalty identifier. Optionally when a caller enters their loyalty identifier the identifier is stored in association with the caller s caller identification phone address. Subsequent calls to the Loyalty RingPool numbers can be streamlined for the caller that is the caller will not have to reenter their loyalty identifier. Optionally rather than have the loyalty member enter their loyalty identifier the loyalty provider makes available or uploads to the PM provider a listing of caller IDs members enrolled in the loyalty program.

Regular Pay Per Call campaigns measure a variety of call characteristics to attempt to predict the conversion of a call. An advertiser selects the characteristics of calls that an affiliate or publisher has to meet in order to qualify for commissions. These include but are not limited to total call duration call duration spent talking to a call center agent keys pressed commands or keywords spoken during the call time of day of the call region the caller was calling from etc.

Cost Per Acquisition CPA is another type of sales campaign also known as Pay on Sale Campaigns which pay out only if there was a sale and optionally determine payout based on a percentage of the sale price. These campaigns enable advertisers to exclusively reward e.g. pay compensation for the calls that drive revenue although optionally fees can be paid for other calls as well . A CPA campaign utilizes integration between the advertiser s call center and the PM system and further incorporates certain modifications to the campaign creation steps which are described below following the description of the additional embodiment of an example Regular Pay Per Call campaign.

As shown in the advertiser is provided the ability to add a new advertising affiliate campaign using the add new campaign module or button control . The advertiser is presented with a form or a wizard tool which provides the advertiser with eight submodules for provisioning a new campaign beginning with the overview submodule. illustrate example user interfaces corresponding to these campaign creation submodules. Fewer additional or different submodules may be used.

With reference to in the Overview submodule the advertiser can enter campaign information such as a campaign name in a campaign name field . A campaign name may be used to identify the campaign for use by the advertiser or publishers. The advertiser can select a campaign type including for example Publisher promotion or affiliate promotion advertiser direct internal syndicated not shown in the figure and RingOut not shown in the figure . A campaign type selection control enables an advertiser to restrict the type of campaign. In addition an advertiser can select a campaign product or services category using a product or services category selection field and enter a campaign description in a description text field .

A RingOut promotion campaign type enables an advertiser to create a campaign that will cause the PM system to call a list of targeted subscribers. The phone addresses to be called by the PM system can be uploaded a data store of the advertiser can be accessed to retrieve a phone number to be called when the call is made or the targeted list can be inferred by previous caller user actions and or associated criteria for example callers in the last 30 days who did not make a purchase .

In an example embodiment an inbound call or an outbound call generated via a click to call instruction for example a voice or fax call from a customer prospect to a RingPool number is placed on a RingOut list and the RingOut list is stored in a data store. Optionally the RingOut list of phone numbers addresses is used in one or more subsequent RingOut campaigns. Optionally the phone address of the customer prospect is only added to the RingOut list if one or more attributes characteristics of the customer prospect customer meets certain criteria e.g. implicit and or explicit attributes discussed herein with respect to marketing automation . Optionally the call treatment associated with the outbound call is modified based at least in part on the attributes characteristics of the customer prospect customer.

For example if the customer prospect is a VIP e.g. a significantly more desirable prospect than a typical prospect the system places a first outcall to an agent before originating a second outcall to the VIP e.g. to ensure there is no delay when the VIP answers the call . In another example rules are applied to customer prospect attributes characteristics to determine at least in part how the call is to be routed or handled e.g. which agent and or call sales center is going to handle the call .

In another example IVR rules are applied to customer prospect attributes characteristics to determine whether an IVR menu is to be played in the outcall and if so which IVR menu s are to be played. Optionally in a RingOut campaign an Interactive Voice Response flow can be configured to branch conditionally based on the attributes characteristics of the prospect customer. For example if a prospect customer completes a form e.g. a web form on a company s web site or accessed via a company phone app the customer prospect is entered into a RingOut campaign. In the campaign the system originates an outbound call to the customer prospect and plays a conditional IVR branch e.g. the system prompts It appears you re interested in learning more about Product A press one to transfer to an operator to learn more about Product A . Optionally the conditional IVR branch is a parameterized template in which the information entered and or selected in the form is dynamically inserted into template prompt text at a marked location. For example the parameterized template may be It appears you re interested in learning more about form field data press one to transfer to an operator . If the user had entered or selected Product A via the form the Product A would be inserted into the template at the location marked form field data. Optionally the RingOut list is used in one or more subsequent advertiser s marketing programs.

The PM system manages tracks records logs and or credits some or all outbound calls in a manner similarly described for inbound calls. For example the call management tracking and crediting process enables an advertiser to associate a commission payout with the publisher that caused and or is associated with the original call. Further the call management tracking and crediting process enables the publisher to tie any credit commission payment back to the original call so that the publisher can measure their program s effectiveness and use the information to modify optimize and or customize their program s to improve their Return On Investment ROI . Optionally the PM system provides a fully customizable Interactive Voice Response session to the caller at the beginning of the outbound call to the subscriber consumer. Optionally a RingOut or outbound call campaign requires that called parties be presented an option to opt out of a campaign and if this option is selected by a called party remove their phone number from the outbound call list. Optionally this is configured by default in the call treatment campaign configuration step described below. Optionally the PM system presents one or more voice prompts to the caller and collects responses from the called party and does not connect the call to a call center. Optionally the PM system initiates a second outbound call to a call center after certain criteria are met including for example ringing call answered voice menu presented response to voice menu detected specific response to voice menu detected fax received etc. Optionally the PM initiates a call to the subscriber consumer first initiates a call to the call center and then bridges the two outbound calls. Optionally the calling order is reversed with the outbound call to the call center placed first.

Optionally a campaign can be restricted to advertiser direct promotions only by selecting the Advertiser direct promotion only control . Selecting Advertiser direct only prevents publishers and affiliates from viewing or accessing ad campaigns created by the advertiser.

Optionally the product or services categories control enables publishers affiliates to search for relevant campaigns by their type insurance travel legal service etc. . Optionally the categories control includes a list of relevant user selectable defined products and or service categories. Optionally the list includes an other product or other service category if the user is unable to find a relevant pre defined product or service. Optionally the selection of an other category causes a text entry field to be displayed in which a user can enter in their own service category. Optionally the selection of an other service category causes a notification to be sent to the PM system operator. These operator notifications can be used to trigger a campaign review and or an update to the pre defined categories. Campaign description text field enables advertisers to provide information to affiliate publishers such as general information concerning the campaign one or more terms and conditions of the campaign general information regarding the advertiser s products and or services general information about the target market for the advertiser s products and or services etc. Optionally the text field includes a collection of text formatting controls to manage font type paragraphing etc.

The Overview submodule optionally also includes a promotional methods control which defaults to all methods . Optionally this promotional methods control enables an Advertiser to restrict the promotional methods used by publishers affiliates for the campaign. Optionally the restrictions are merely informational requests to publishers affiliates. Optionally there are web robots bots which run automated searches associated with publishers affiliates to ensure conformance with the specified methods. Optionally other methods are used involving publisher affiliate audits using trained operators and third party agents.

Optionally the promotional method control when selected generates a display listing online promotional methods see including but not limited to 

Optionally each category of promotional methods includes an allow or do not allow control . Optionally the advertiser can specify in a note field next to each promotional method any caveats or special permissions required to promote using the site type.

Optionally campaign expiration date controls on the web page enable an advertiser to specify an active campaign time period. Optionally a user selects the expire control and enters an expected end date for the campaign or by selecting the calendar control and selecting a date on a calendar display. Reaching the expiration date of an ad campaign caused the campaign to be no longer accessible or visible to publishers and affiliates. In addition when a campaign expires calls stop routing to the campaign s destination phone number and payouts to publisher and affiliates for calls end. Optionally selecting the ongoing control removes any entered expiration data or time period on the campaign. Optionally the Overview submodule includes a Next control which when selected by a user transitions control from the Step 1 Overview submodule to the Step 2 Call Treatment submodule.

In the Call Treatment submodule Step 2 the Advertiser can set how incoming calls are to be routed and the caller experience. Call treatment options help Advertisers filter out calls for improved conversion rates. See description of for additional details on how incoming calls are to be managed including entering destination phone number to receive calls and configure SMS promotions. A call treatment option includes configuring an Interactive Voice Response IVR tree see . Optionally the Call Treatment submodule includes a record call control which when selected by a user causes calls routed through the system to be audibly recorded. Optionally the PM system administrator configures the minimum call recording length or the determination of lack of received fax. Optionally call recordings or received fax pages below the minimum threshold are deleted. Optionally the recorded calls are made available to the user by a number of conventional methods including by sending the user emails with attached audio or fax data files of the recordings by an account display of all calls including the time of the call length of the call caller information audio or fax data recording etc. and by accessing the calls by calling the system and reviewing listening to the recorded calls. Optionally the recorded calls are transcribed using speech to text methods and the text messages are sent to the user via email or as described above in an account display of the calls. Optionally important keywords e.g. keywords designated by an advertiser are detected in the audio and assembled into a tag cloud for that call. Optionally the PM system uses the tag cloud for a call to determine the payout. Optionally references to the content of a call and or message herein include the transcription of the call and or message into text. For example the transfer of the content of the call and or message may comprise in whole or in part the transfer of the transcription of the call and or message.

In an example embodiment received fax messages can be scanned e.g. using Optical Character Recognition OCR and or other document editing tools for important keywords e.g. keywords designated by an advertiser and assembled into a tag cloud for that call. Optionally the PM system uses the tag cloud for a call to determine the payout. Optionally the reference to the content of a fax in this specification includes the text of the fax using for example OCR. For example the transfer of the content of the call and or message can be the transfer of the text of the fax.

Optionally there are several standard options in configuring an IVR tree which include any combination of asking the caller a single question asking the caller questions followed by a series of user responses forwarding the call to a nearest call center e.g. as determined by the PM system from a list of defined campaign manager call centers wherein the system uses e.g. signaling information associated with the inbound call to determine in the nearest call center or the caller s location information from a mobile device of the user to determine the nearest call center forwarding the call to a single call center e.g. a phone number offer a text message e.g. if the user is calling from a mobile device as determined by the PM system sending a text message to the user device or prompting the user to enter their mobile device number and then sending a text message hang up and check a call condition. A call condition can optionally be checked to invoke an IVR tree or options within an IVR tree e.g. to allow for multiple tree branches . Optionally calls can be routed and or commissioned differently based on the user s responses to the IVR tree.

Optionally an Interactive Voice Response flow can be configured to branch conditionally based on the keyword search term entered by the user and or used in the search query. For example if a customer prospect entered the search query Product A and the user originates a call to a RingPool number associated with the displayed search results e.g. calls or selects a click to call option the system plays a conditional IVR branch e.g. the system prompts It appears you re interested in learning more about Product A press one to transfer to an operator . Optionally the conditional IVR branch is a parameterized template in which the search query term is dynamically inserted into template text. In this example the parameterized template is It appears you re interested in learning more about keyword press one to transfer to an operator where the search query term replaces keyword .

Other optional call conditions include region see creating regions during business hours see setting business hours phone type landline or mobile as determined by the PM system user device e.g. smartphone tablet computer iPhone iPad Android device set top box interactive television etc. general or specific demographics of the caller general or specific psychographics of the user holidays number of call number of calls within a given period etc. Optionally logic operators can be used to create combinations of conditions including for example in out during after and or not greater than less than equal to etc. An example combination of conditions is in region or during hours .

Optionally an Interactive Voice Response flow can be configured to branch conditionally based on a resource URL. When that condition is reached during a call the PM system will access that URL passing it a set of parameters that describe the campaign that is executing and details about the call and the caller. The response returned from that URL is then used to determine whether to take the branch or not. Optionally the response may be set to contain the phone number of a call center to connect the call to. This allows the service that is hosting the resource URL to use its own logic data and third party resources such as other resource URLs to determine the best call center to direct that call to. For example the service hosting the URL could put the call out for real time bid and the highest bidder will receive the call. Another example is if someone who searches University of Phoenix Portland Oreg. and then calls the displayed number will optionally have their call routed to the Portland Oreg. office for the University of Phoenix.

To setup a question response IVR tree the campaign manager selects the Ask a question option in the scroll menu . In response to the user selection the PM system prompts the user to enter the text of the question in the text field . The PM system converts the text to speech and the converted text is played to callers. Optionally the PM system includes a play control which if selected by the manager plays the text entered in the field . Optionally for better quality prompts professional prompt recordings can be uploaded and configured into the IVR tree. Optionally the PM system displays a list of potential caller keypad entry responses to the question. Alternatively a new set of controls is displayed for each possible keypress. In this example the keypress is a valid response to the question played to the caller at the start of the call. The manager configured the call treatment keypad 1 response by selecting the forward to call center option from the scroll menu . The PM system optionally responds to the selection by displaying a play prompt first option check box control and a destination number or phone address field of the advertiser s call center.

In this example the manager selected the Play prompt first control which optionally causes the PM system to display a text field . The PM system converts the text to speech and the converted text is played to the caller if the 1 key is entered by a user during a call. Optionally the PM system includes a play control which if selected by the manager plays the text entered in the field . In this example the manager configured the call treatment keypad 2 response by selecting the hangup option from the scroll menu . Callers selecting the keypad 2 response cause the PM system to hangup the call. Optionally the last configured response option becomes the default action for any keypad responses not specified by the user or PM system support staff configure on behalf of the campaign manager any unspecified keypad response options. Optionally a New control is displayed which when selected adds the next sequential keypad IVR response control to be configured. Optionally the user interface includes a delete control which deletes the configured IVR response control.

Another standard Call Treatment configuration option is forward to nearest location . The advertising manager provides the PM system with a list of geographic locations for call center locations e.g. car dealerships tax preparation centers medical offices etc. . If the forward to nearest location is activated the PM system transfers the call to a location nearest the caller s geographic location. The location is determined by the PM system using for example a geographic inference from the caller s caller ID. Optionally other methods are used. For example a caller can be prompted to enter their zip code. Or optionally a guess can be made about caller location inferring from their phone number for example and the caller can be prompted to confirm or correct the region. The PM system can then determine by querying one or more databases the closest location nearest the user entered zip code. In another example the user may be calling from a mobile device with GPS location features. If a PM system application is active on the mobile device the application can optionally be queried by the PM system e.g. identifying the device using the mobile device caller ID to determine the user s location. The PM system can then transfer the call to a location nearest the user s location. In another example the PM system may access the location of the mobile device by accessing a third party system or third party database which is tracking the mobile device s location. Geographic location information and or approximate geographic location of a caller e.g. a customer and or customer prospect is optionally determined. For example the geographic location information and or approximate geographic location of a caller is optionally determined from call signaling information associated with an inbound call as described above. In addition a call signaling parameter labeled the Jurisdiction Information Parameter JIP in an SS7 IAM message or SIP T parameter can optionally be used to determine geographic location information associated with the caller. In an example embodiment the JIP parameter is populated with a NPA NXX number e.g. a 6 digit NPA NXX number when an inbound call transits from the wireless network to the wireline network. This NPA NXX indicates a geographic area from which the wireless call originated where the NPA portion indicates the area code from which the call originated and the NXX portion indicates the telephone office exchange from which the call originated. As in the previous example this information can then be used to transfer the call to the location nearest the user. Optionally the campaign manager configures the IVR tree to interact with the user to for example ask permission to obtain the user s location information directly or from a separate data source. To configure this option the manager selects the forward to nearest location using the At Start menu control scroll see .

Certain embodiments enable a user such as a campaign manager to specify a forward to dynamic location call treatment configuration option. By way of illustration if the forward to dynamic location is selected optionally in response to a call the system queries one or more internal or external e.g. accessed via a data network connection where the data store is optionally provided by a third party data stores to determine a preferred or best available call routing or location to route the call e.g. via a bridged outbound call . Optionally information about the call is transmitted in association with the query including for example the caller s phone number and or one or more implicit and or explicit attributes. Optionally in response to the query the data store returns a phone address which is received by the system or the system determines based at least in part on the query response from the data store where to route the call to e.g. the most available call center or a VIP call center and or how to route the call.

Optionally the manager can configure the PM system to play a voice prompt to the caller before transferring the call or by selecting the Play prompt first check box control . The campaign manager optionally can configure the PM system to transfer to a geographic location with a specified distance in miles although other measures of distance can be used as well including for example kilometers . The campaign manager specifies the distance by entering in the number field the number of miles e.g. 50 . Optionally the caller is asked to confirm the location they are calling about with an option to choose a different location. Optionally the call is simply transferred to the system determined geographic location if the location is within the specified geographic radius. Optionally the system allows the manager to configure an optional action if the caller is not within the specified radius. For example the manager could configure an IVR sub tree or branch. Optionally the call is forwarded to a centralized or regional call center if the caller is not local to the nearest location by selecting the Forward to call center menu scroll control . As above the PM system displays controls which enable the manager to play a prompt before transferring the call enter the voice prompt text to be played to a caller on transfer and enter the call center number in the phone address field optionally the phone number address field is pre populated with the advertiser s call center if for example the call center number is stored in the advertiser s account profile .

Another standard Call Treatment configuration option is forward to call center . Optionally the call is transferred without a voice prompt. In this case the call experience is simply a direct call transfer to the specified phone number. The PM system is transparent to the caller. To configure this call treatment the campaign manager selects the forward to call center option in the menu scroll control and enters a destination number in the phone address field .

Optionally the call treatment submodule display includes a Call Forwarding control which configures the phone number displayed at the destination phone address for voice and or fax calls. The default option is the display of the caller s original caller identification phone address. In response to the user selection of the Call Forwarding control a Call Forwarding settings pop up window or new web page is displayed see . From the Call Forwarding settings a campaign manager can customize several forwarding options. The default forwarding option control configures the Original Calling Party s phone address to be displayed at the campaign destination number e.g. call center . A second control configures the publisher s promotional phone number to be displayed at the destination number which optionally can include local long distance international and toll free phone addresses .

A third control configures the PM system to display a campaign manager specified caller identification number for all calls. For example a campaign manager can optionally replace the caller s caller ID with the number 212 555 5555 by entering the phone address 212 555 5555 in the field . If a customer calls a promotional number associated with the campaign from the number 805 645 1234 the caller ID displayed to the call center agent would be 212 555 5555 and not 805 645 1234. A fourth control configures the dynamic replacement of digits in the caller s number with one or more fixed numbers. The campaign manager specifies in the field the fixed numbers and their position in the number string leaving the caller s original numbers in the non specified positions marked with an X . For example if a campaign manager would like to replace the area code in all calls with the fixed area code and otherwise retain the original caller s number the campaign manager enters 212 XXX XXXX in the field . If a customer calls a promotional number associated with the campaign from the number 805 645 1234 the caller ID displayed to the call center agent would be 212 645 1234. Optionally this can be a Session Initiation Protocol SIP address and or optional SIP values rather than a phone number. This feature for example enables replacing the caller ID with a unique numeric ID that can be used later to match up call records such as to determine pay on sale but does not disclose the actual caller ID. Optionally the call forwarding web page includes an update control which if selected by the campaign manager updates the manager s selection in the PM system database.

Optionally the Call Treatment submodule includes a Next control which when selected by a user transitions control from the Step 2 Call Treatment submodule to the Step 3 Hours submodule. Optionally the Call Treatment submodule includes a Previous control which when selected by a user transitions control from the Step 2 Call Treatment submodule to the Step 1 Overview submodule. Optionally the Call Treatment submodule includes a Jump To control which when selected by a user transitions control to any of the campaign creation submodules.

From the Hours submodule Step 3 the user can set the hours of operation when the campaign destination is available to answer calls e.g. call center hours of operation see . For a description of the Hours submodule controls see related description of . Optionally the controls to set hours by day of the week is displayed when the 24 7 default control is unselected. Optionally the time zone control defaults to those of the campaign manager. Optionally the PM system can dynamically route calls to one or more different call centers depending upon their respective hours of availability agent availability conversion rates call durations or other feedback from the call center s either directly or as inferred by the system and or system operation staff etc.

From the Target Regions submodule Step 4 an advertiser can specify the areas within the geographic region country state city etc. from which they prefer to receive voice and fax calls see . Optionally call pricing payouts can be based at least in part on these regions. Optionally the Target Regions display includes a control which does not place any restrictions on inbound calls. All calls within the U.S. and Canada are accepted and routed to the configured destination phone address although certain specific calling numbers may be blocked . Optionally the Target Regions displayed include a Choose Target Region control that if selected displays controls and editable fields. These controls enable a manager to optionally specify preferred regions in which publishers affiliates payouts are adjusted. Optionally each target region includes a target region title text field which enables a user to specify a title for a target region. Optionally each target region can be narrowed to a state or province or city or other region subset by selecting the select Target Region Type control .

Optionally depending upon the Target Region Type selected a second control is displayed to the campaign manager in response to the selection. If a State or Province is selected a select State control is displayed which includes a predefined list of States. If a City is selected a select City control is displayed which includes a predefined list of Cities States. Optionally the user interface includes a control to add additional target regions. Optionally the user interface includes a control to delete preferred target regions. Optionally the user interface includes a control to add new named regions. Optionally a campaign manager submits or uploads a list of approved geographic areas e.g. area codes or zip codes which are used by the PM system. Optionally these are submitted to the PM operations personnel for uploading. This uploading eliminates the task of manually entering hundreds or thousands of approved geographic areas. Optionally the user interface includes submodule navigation controls and as described with respect to .

In the Payout submodule Step 5 a user Advertiser can set the pricing for calls. A base payout e.g. commission paid on a call can be specified in addition to bonuses if certain criteria are met. Enabling an Advertiser to specify payout criteria allows the Advertiser to pay out only for good calls thereby encouraging more of them. The Payout submodule includes a Base Payout dollar entry field . The amount entered by the user determines the payout to a publisher affiliate if a condition to the right of the payout field has been met. The Payout submodule also includes a text entry condition field in which one or more conditions can be specified for an established payout fee. Conditions optionally include but are not limited to the period of time from receipt of a call to the termination of the call by the calling party the period of time from receipt of a call to the termination of the call by the called party the period of time from receipt of a call to the termination of the call by the calling and called party the period of time from receipt of a call to the termination of the call by the calling or called party the period of time beginning after call origination from the PM system to a destination number until call termination by the calling party the period of time beginning after call origination from the PM system to a destination number until call termination by the called party the period of time beginning after call origination from the PM system to a destination number until call termination by the calling and called party the period of time beginning after call origination from the PM system to a destination number until call termination by the calling or called party the period of time beginning after receipt of answer at the destination number until call termination by calling party the period of time beginning after receipt of answer at the destination number until call termination by called party the period of time beginning after receipt of answer at the destination number until call termination by calling and called party the period of time beginning after receipt of answer at the destination number until call termination by calling or called party the Target Region from which the call originated the Target Region from which the call terminated the Target Region from which the call originated and call terminated the time of day the call was received by the PM system if the call was received by the PM system during specified business hours if the call originated from a landline network if the call originated from a wireless network the type of device the call originated from e.g. smart phone tablet computer etc. the application s the caller may have originated the call from on their calling device the application s running on the device at the time the calling device originated the call the GPS location of the calling device at the time the call was originated if a coupon or discount was associated with the promotion if the call originated from an area in proximity to a location of the advertiser if the caller was sent an SMS within a configurable period of time if the caller allowed access to certain private data e.g. age marital status credit information etc. payment method of associated transaction e.g. credit card bill to phone bill Paypal checking account etc. if a fax message was received the number of pages of a received fax identified keywords within a fax fax form completion percentage fax purchase order fax signature page etc.

Conditions also optionally include call results received from the call center e.g. if the call converted sale amount etc. . Optionally the payout amount can also be conditioned for example as a percentage of a sale amount. Optionally the conditions described above can be combined in determining the base payout using logical conjunctions And Or and logical disjunction Not phrases. Optionally the user interface includes a condition control which allows an Advertiser to select from a list of predefined conditions and conjunctions to create the desired payout condition. Optionally the set of condition controls includes a Done control which signals to the PM system the user has completed the payout condition statement. Optionally after a condition has been defined and the Done control selected the display lists the payouts regular and bonus and their associated condition s . Optionally the user interface includes an edit option not shown in which if selected allows a user to edit their condition and or payout. Optionally the user interface includes a delete option not shown in which if selected allows a user to delete a bonus payout.

Optionally the Payout submodule includes a Bonus control . Bonuses are payouts or commissions for calls added on top of the base payout if the condition s are met. For example a call which meets a base condition a first bonus condition and second bonus condition receives a payout equal to the base amount plus the first bonus condition amount plus the second bonus condition amount. Structurally the configuration display and controls for bonuses are the same as that described for Payout there is a bonus dollar field and an associated configurable condition s . Optionally the Payout submodule includes a configurable repeat caller time period e.g. hours days weeks months etc. restriction control a fraud protection mechanism designed to prevent callers from gaming the system by repeatedly calling the advertiser in order to accrue payout revenues. Optionally the user interface includes submodule navigation controls and as described in .

From the Target Profile submodule Step 6 the advertiser can select from a range of caller profile attributes to enable publishers to better target their promotions at a preferred audience see . Optionally the Target Profile specified is informational and not enforced by the PM system. Optionally the Target Profile criteria is considered when deciding whether to transfer a call to the campaign s destination phone address. Optionally the Target Profile criteria is used in determining payouts commissions to publishers and affiliates. The Target Profile submodule can be used to target customers by gender income marital status etc. and optionally set a hierarchy within each field. For a description of the Target Profile submodule controls see related description of . Optionally the user interface includes submodule navigation controls and as described in .

Optionally advertisers provide creatives e.g. advertisements including for example banner ads for the ad campaign they create. These creatives are available for use by publishers and affiliates and are uploaded in the Creatives submodule Step 7 . An advertiser can upload one or more creatives and one or more types of creatives. Optionally any previously uploaded creatives are also displayed and the campaign manager can select them to be included in the campaign. Optionally the PM system displays a default Ad identifier for example established during account creation. Ad identifiers are used for example to identify a creative and for tracking reporting e.g. to determine which landing page to send the online user to as described below . Optionally the campaign manager edits the default Ad identifier to create a unique identifier for each uploaded creative. The latter enables an Advertiser to get more refined feedback on the effectiveness of individual creatives.

To add a new creative the user first selects the type of creative to upload by selecting the creative type control . The creative type control includes a predefined list of creatives including but not limited to Images various sized online banners text emails html print hi def images video facsimile and audio files for radio and network television commercials. Optionally once a creative type has been selected contextual fields and controls relating to the type of creative to be uploaded are displayed. In the case of uploading a banner a creative description text field is displayed. The campaign manager enters a word description for the creative to make it easier to refer to. Optionally a choose file control is displayed in the Creatives submodule which enables the manager to choose a file from the memory of the device they are accessing the PM system from. Optionally a source file upload control is provided on the web page for a higher quality creative upload. Optionally the default Ad ID is displayed in an editable text field . The user has the option to modify the Ad ID in order to create a unique Ad ID for the Ad. Once a file has been selected for uploading the user can optionally select the upload control which causes the upload of the file to the PM system. Optionally the Creative Module displays a list of creatives which have previously been uploaded by the advertiser. If the user selects the check box control the creative is associated with the campaign. Optionally the user interface includes submodule navigation controls not shown as described with respect to .

 Advertisers can place a call to action or phone number on a piece of creative and the PM system will serve replace the correct phone number into that piece of creative. Also with networks that have TV or radio creative in addition to providing them with a unique phone number per creative we also provide them with a unique URL they can include in those ads which includes the underlying publisher phone number in the URL so the PM system can credit those web based transactions back to the correct lead source. 

In the Visibility and Approval Step 8 submodule an advertiser can dictate which publishers can view and apply for the campaign see . In addition the Visibility and Approval submodule enables a user to configure how each applicant is approved for a campaign. The Visibility and Approval submodule optionally consist of two sets of three controls. The first set of controls is used to configure which publishers and or affiliates are allowed to access the campaign once it is live. The first control in the first set of controls makes the campaign available to all publishers and or affiliates in the PM system. The second control in the first set of controls makes the campaign available to all publishers and or affiliates that have been approved by the advertiser in other campaigns. The third control in the first set of controls makes the campaign only available to publishers and or affiliates who have been specifically invited by the advertiser. The second set of controls illustrates how campaign applicants are approved. The first control in the second set of controls configures the system to automatically approve all applicants to the campaign. The second control in the first set of controls configures the system to automatically approve all applicants that have been previously approved by the advertiser in other campaigns. All other applicants to the campaign must be individually approved by the user campaign manager. The third control in the second set of controls configures the system such that all applicants to the campaign must be individually approved by the user campaign manager. Optionally the user interface includes submodule navigation controls and as described in . Optionally the user interface includes a Done control which when selected signifies to the PM system that the manager is finished creating the campaign.

Optionally the PM system can be configured to integrate with partner click tracking networks in which case consumer clicks e.g. ad selection by the user on an affiliate or publisher s site are directed to the PM system which are then further redirected back to the click tracking network. The click tracking network then determines which advertiser landing page to send the consumer to. Optionally as described in this specification the PM system includes a static or RingPool phone number in the redirect.

Optionally the PM system can be configured as a hosted network for example if the affiliate network does not have their own click tracking platform. In this configuration there is not a click tracking platform to integrate with so consumer clicks e.g. ad selection by the user on an affiliate or publisher s site are directed to the PM system which determines which advertiser landing page to send the consumer to.

Optionally the PM system closes the loop on calls that have converted into sales or qualified leads and ties them back relates them to specific media campaigns that lead the consumer to call. The PM system matching algorithms enable advertisers using any type of media optionally including search engine optimization and paid search to match calls that originated from specific media placements or keyword search activity to sales or qualified leads that occurred once the consumer interacted with a sales agent. These matching algorithms use for example a combination of some or all of the following the media placement online session ID click ID tracking phone number consumer s caller id time origination of the call geographic location of the caller or callers phone number duration of the call and occasionally conversational elements of the call e.g. keywords that took place and or other information to determine that the call was qualified and may store an indication that the call was qualified unqualified other known information about the caller e.g. implicit and explicit data either as determined by the system or by appending other data elements e.g. third party data to the caller s record. Optionally the advertiser can report transfer qualified call information e.g. a sale for a qualified call back to the PM system and the details of the call and or any other relevant information that an advertiser e.g. an advertiser call center gathered is associated with the original call record. Some or all of the foregoing information may be made available via PM system reporting interfaces for example enabling advertisers and publishers to enhance or optimize their media placements and media spending based at least in part on integrated calls and qualified call data.

In an example embodiment as described above in the campaign creation Overview submodule there are different types of ad sales campaigns. In a Cost Per Acquisition CPA sales campaign the payout is contingent for example on the actual acquisition of a customer and optionally the payout is based upon a percentage of the sales price. In some CPA campaigns Advertisers conventionally do not close their sales over the phone but in person or at least not on the first phone call. But they do associate particular transactions on that call e.g. scheduling an install appointment with a successful conversion and prefer to associate keywords and callers with those conversions in their tracking systems. Therefore a significant difference in campaign creation is the payout step. In addition since the payout is based at least in part upon customer acquisition there is a feedback link from the advertiser s call center regarding these customer acquisitions e.g. a data communication link between the call center and the PM system that is used to return the results of each call . Optionally the PM system provides an Application Programmatic Interface API from which the call center can integrate their computing information systems. With the call center integration to the PM system the PM system pays at least in part on or solely on the outcome of a voice or fax call. Optionally other methods are available for reporting order information or revenue generated for each phone call to the PM platform including for example email file uploads account screen scrapes etc.

The following illustrates an example embodiment call center PM system API. Optionally the call center API integration involves two steps 1 PM system personnel provide the advertiser a call center id username and password credentials 2 the call center sends over a data communication link e.g. using http post methods the details of each call to the PM system during the call or after it has completed. An example post is https api0.acme.com api 2010 04 22 calls 23.xml where 2010 04 22 is an API version and 23 at the end is the ID for a call center on the acme PM platform.

Optionally the call center PM system API HTTP return status will be 201 Created for a successful POST or a 200 OK for a successful PUT a 4xx code if one of the parameters is incorrect or a 5xx code if a server error occurred. In the latter two error cases a detailed error class and message are optionally returned in XML in the body. Optionally if use http status 0 is given the status will always be returned as 200 Ok or 201 Created. This return status is used to see the detailed error message in the body when working with HTTP libraries that discard or conceal the body of the response for non 2XX response codes.

There are certain system configurations in which the call processing system or subsystem is located geographically separate from one or more other support systems involved in a campaign such as for example a call center system. In certain cases a first provider is responsible for the call processing system and a second provider e.g. wherein the second provider may comprise a plurality of providers is responsible for the other support systems involved in a campaign. In an example embodiment a first provider e.g. a call performance marketing provider such as Invoca manages a call processing system and transfers conferences and or bridges calls e.g. wherein the calls are inbound and or outbound calls to a second provider e.g. wherein the second provider is a merchant of goods and or services . In this example embodiment it is advantageous to transfer information determined about the call and or the calling party by the first provider to the second provider responsible for addressing the needs of the calling party. As described herein a call center Application Programming Interface API that communicates over a data network is an example embodiment of a technique of transferring determined information associated with the calling party between systems subsystems and or providers. Optionally in addition or instead a SIP network may be used at least in part to transfer determined information regarding the call and or caller between one or more systems subsystems and or providers. Optionally a SIP T or SIP I protocol can be used to pass data via messages and or parameters between for example a call processing system initially receiving the call and a recipient call center. Optionally the content exchanged as described herein above with respect to the call center data network API is similarly transferred as a set of parameter s and or message s in a SIP T or SIP I network configuration.

Optionally the call processing system queries one or more internal or external data stores for example using the caller identification information received in the call signaling information e.g. from the CallerID field associated with the call as a query parameter to collect additional information about the caller. Optionally the call processing system queries one or more internal and or external data stores with the caller identification information as a parameter even if the caller identification field is marked private in the received call signaling data. Optionally some or all of the information determined about the caller in a private call is made available to the recipient provider or provider s support systems except for information that may be used by the recipient provider to identify the caller. For example the private caller s location or caller s age or age range may be determined from one or more data base queries and transferred to the recipient provider via a data network or otherwise but the caller s name is not transferred to the recipient provider. Optionally some or all of the implicit and explicit information further described herein is determined from queries and transferred to the recipient provider.

Optionally the call processing system solicits the caller e.g. using an automated interactive voice response system to provide additional identification or to clarify their reason for calling via a keypress and or by speaking additional information which may then be passed on to the recipient provider. Thus the illustrated system architecture can be used to facilitate the data transfer between providers systems and or subsystems of information known accessible and or determined by the call processing system to enhance the performance of the personnel e.g. wherein the personnel are customer service agent or sales agent or automated system responding to customer and customer prospect inquiries. Optionally the data transfers as described herein may be performed using techniques such as SIP internetworking API data transfer data store file sharing and or other data transfer techniques including those known to those skilled in the art of data networking.

As discussed herein the call processing system may be geographically separated from a call center and the call center system infrastructure. Optionally the information associated with an inbound call or a calling party is transferred in one or more discrete segments optionally spaced apart in time as the caller customer customer prospect is being serviced. In an example embodiment a call center user interface provided for display on a terminal may be continuously updated by the system as additional information is received or derived through the duration of the call and or even after the call has concluded. In an example embodiment a call is received at a call processing system. Optionally an audio video and or data connection is created between the call processing system and one or more support agents. Optionally a first set of information associated with the inbound call is transferred and presented via a user interface to the call center agent before during or after a voice and or video channel call is opened between the inbound caller and the agent.

Optionally the first set of data transferred includes information immediately available to the call processing system including for example call signaling information associated with the call. In this example embodiment subsequent to the first data transfer one or more queries may be performed by the call processing system and or other support systems comprising the system e.g. wherein the system is a call processing system and or marketing automation platform to determine additional information about the call and or caller and or reason for the call. Optionally a second set of data e.g. wherein the second set of data sets may comprise a plurality of data sets received collected in response to the queries is transferred and presented via the user interface to the call center agent. Optionally the second set of data includes for example the caller s name the type of network e.g. wireless wireline the call originated from whether the call originated from a fixed or mobile device the caller s geographic location the current lead score of the caller as accessed or calculated by the system the web page the caller was viewing prior to or during the call e.g. the web page the called phone address was displayed on or in association with and or any other implicit or explicit information which can be determined about the call or caller as further described herein.

In this example embodiment a third set of data e.g. wherein the third set of data sets may comprise a plurality of data sets relating to customer declared information e.g. information manually provided by the customer caller verbally via keypress or otherwise is transferred and presented to the call center agent. Optionally the declared data is received in response to the call processing system prompting the customer caller e.g. via an IVR session to enter additional caller identification and or call reason data. For example a third set of data may include an indication regarding a customer prospect s selection of a pricing option or the detection of the caller spoken word pricing . Optionally the third set of data is transferred and presented to the call center agent as soon as the caller s response s are received but after the first set of data and before or after the second set of data is transferred and or presented to the agent. Optionally a fourth set of data associated with the call and or caller is transferred and presented to the call center agent in response to one or more call events including but not limited to a detected spoken keyword or key phrase in a monitored call session the expiration of one or more specified time periods during the call session a caller s detected inflection in a monitored call session a detected caller s keyword key phrase response to an agent s question in a monitored call session and other call events as described herein.

Optionally the call center system may provide a display of a sales script e.g. text to be read on a terminal of an agent. Optionally the call processing and or marketing automation platform may dynamically control which sales script is presented e.g. based at least in part on explicit or implicit data relating to the customer such as data described herein . Optionally the sales script is dynamically modified during the call and or a new sales script is presented based upon one or more triggering call events including for example the expiration of a specified time period during the call or a detected keyword phrase as described herein. Optionally the system continuously monitors the audio and or video channel associated with the customer prospect call until the caller channel session terminates e.g. the caller or agent hangs up . Call monitoring may include but is not limited to one or more of the following call session periods after the receipt of the call and prior to call answer after the call or during the call even when the agent is speaking and until caller disconnection is received by the network including a specified time period after the termination of the agent call connection . With respect to the last case optionally the call is disconnected by the call processing system if the caller does not disconnect after a specified time period e.g. 30 seconds 1 minute 5 minutes etc. .

In an example embodiment certain indicators detected in the voice e.g. using a speech recognition voice analysis system and or video channels of the customer prospect call e.g. wherein indicators include one or more of the following keywords certain changes in tone and inflection detection of an increase in background noise detection of certain sounds in the background noise e.g. a baby crying or siren may indicate a need to close the call rapidly or collect call back information and or callback permissions from the caller and thus necessitate the need to dynamically change the call script. Optionally the illustrative system records and or logs the background information associated with each call. Optionally the monitored background call information is data mined analyzed to determine the appropriate agent action if any which should be taken to improve the outcome of future calls. Thus the illustrated system architecture can be used to enhance and or modify in substantially real time information about the call and or caller presented to the agent handling the call to achieve and or enhance the call center s goals and objectives.

We now return to the process of creating a campaign in a Cost Per Acquisition CPA sales campaign in the PM system. As mentioned above a significant difference beyond the call center integration is the structure of the payout. In the Payout submodule the user campaign manager selects the integrated call center from the scroll menu optionally the list of call centers is configured by for example PM system personnel when they establish the call center integration with the PM system and enters a percentage of sales in the percentage of sales condition field or optionally enter a flat rate amount by entering an amount in base amount field and 0 in percentage of sales condition field or some combination of base amount and percentage of sales . The percentage of sales ranges from 0 to 100 percent. Optionally there are other conditions beyond a percentage of sales including Sku list and Reason see call center PM API Optional Tracking Sales parameters described above . illustrates other web page controls and conditions further described with respect to .

In addition to affiliates publishers and advertisers describe above there are also Network campaign manager entities. Network campaign managers provide campaign management services for those advertisers who would like to use the PM system but want to keep information private from their advertiser clients or do not have the time or inclination to become trained on the PM system nor manage campaigns and affiliates publishers. A managed advertiser does not create campaigns or manage campaign privileges the network manager performs these tasks. Network campaign creation is similar to that described above except that the advertiser s account is configured as Network managed as illustrated in . In addition in the payout submodule a network manager configures merchant advertiser payouts in addition to the publisher affiliates payouts as illustrated in . The difference between what is paid out by the merchant advertiser and what is paid to publisher affiliates is the network managers return. illustrates other web page controls further described with respect to .

Advertisers optionally can create advertiser direct campaigns. In this scenario the advertiser uses the platform for call and conversion tracking without having other parties promoting their product service. Because there are no affiliates or publishers the campaign wizard used to create a campaign does not have the payout the target profile and the visibility and approval steps.

The third type of campaign is syndication. In this case a publisher or network promotes an offer found on another network. This enables the advertiser to expand the number of affiliates publishers participating in the advertiser s campaign. This also enables the Network manager to receive commissions associated with the advertiser s campaign and the affiliates publishers get more opportunities to generate advertising revenues on their sites. The PM system facilitates syndicated networks by simplifying the integration of the advertiser s campaign into the new Network and providing the Network manager various call tracking and payout reports.

Certain differences in setting up a syndicated campaign from a regular Pay per Call campaign are now described. First the Network campaign manager applies to the original campaign the campaign to be syndicated promoted by the affiliates publishers of the Network . After the affiliate publisher sign up and approval process the Network campaign manager receives a promotional phone number a number used exclusively by the affiliate publisher to track calls originated by the affiliate publisher to the PM system. Next the Network campaign manager configures the syndicated campaign by first selecting the syndicated promotion check box control see in the Overview submodule.

In the second step the Network campaign manager enters the promotional number assigned during the affiliate publisher sign up process in the number field see . Optionally the Network campaign manager agrees to certain terms and conditions by selecting the check box control . In the third step of syndicated campaign creation the Network manager establishes payouts. Since syndication involves Networks the payout user interface of the PM system is structured to reflect what the advertiser is paying for qualified calls the margin the Network receives and the payout to the affiliate publisher see . In this syndication payout user interface the advertiser pay in display is determined from and synchronized with the associated advertiser s original campaign. Any changes by the advertiser to the campaign is stored in the PM system and automatically reflected in this user interface including but not limited to creatives terms such as payouts hours etc. That is changes to the master campaign flow to the syndicating campaigns. The Network campaign manager specifies a percentage in the margin field . If the Network campaign manager selects the Recalculate payout control the system calculates the affiliates publishers payout by subtracting the margin percentage from the advertiser s pay in per qualified call. Optionally the user interface display of includes submodule navigation controls as further described with respect to .

Optionally a syndicated campaign call flow is different than the call flow of the other campaign types discussed above although this flow difference may be transparent to the caller. In one example embodiment of syndicated calls the consumer calls the promotional number the same promotional number entered in the number field and the call is received by the PM system. The PM system uses the called number to determine which campaign to invoke in this case the syndicated campaign. The PM system then internally connects to the original campaign promotional number creating an internal system call leg. Optionally the PM system receives the internal call to the original campaign promotional number and connects to the original campaign. The PM system performs the call treatment steps of the original campaign e.g. IVR tree and then transfers the call to the original campaign destination call center e.g. advertiser call center . The internal call leg is maintained for the duration of the call. The call legs including the internal call leg are used by the PM system to simplify reporting and internally track publisher affiliate and Network manager payouts. In summary the benefits of syndication include for example campaigns stay in sync sub ids to provide customization without revealing sources payouts stay in sync and margins are fixed so they are never upside down e.g. payouts exceed budget elimination of double charges on telecom the original advertiser pays telecom fees better call quality by not cascading calls through the phone network hence no audio or fax data degradation such as additional packet delay in VOIP.

In another example embodiment the marketing automation platform supports Multi Level Marketing MLM programs campaigns. Similar to syndication MLM marketing sales provides for the credit and or compensation for a sale made by a member or group within a sales force and for the sales of salespeople that the member or group recruit generally referred to as downline participants . For example if John Smith is a member of a MLM sales program sells a product or service e.g. during a telephony transaction the marketing automation platform provides a credit or compensation to John Smith s account for the sale. Optionally If John Smith is downline from other members of the MLM sales program the marketing automation platform if so configured provides a credit or compensation amount and or percentage of the sale to the member or group who recruited John Smith. Similarly the marketing automation platform if so configured provides a credit or compensation amount and or percentage of the sale to the member or group who recruited John Smith s recruiter and so on. Optionally the configuration of an MLM program is similar to that described above for a syndicated campaign. Optionally the system enables the user to configure fixed downline credit compensation rates e.g. 5.00 per sale for the member making the sale 2.00 for the member s recruiter 1.00 for the member s member s recruiter etc. . Optionally the system enables the user to configure percentage of sale downline credit compensation rates. Optionally the amount to credit compensate a specific member and or group and or the member s downlines and or group s downlines is user customizable on a per transaction basis or a set of transactions.

Optionally the marketing automation platform described herein can be used to automate assist in MLM sales. In an example embodiment the marketing automation platform is used to manage an email based demand generation program for a member or group of members within an MLM. Optionally sales attribution methods described with respect to the marketing automation platform are used to determine and payout member based credits and or compensation. Thus for example although member X may have closed a sale member Y having played a role in the sales process e.g. lead nurturing may be entitled to a credit compensation amount along with the member s recruiters as described above. In another example embodiment an organization and or member s are compensated credited based at least in part on lead generation. Optionally the quality and characteristics both implicit and explicit of the leads result in the marketing automation and telephony platform system applying higher or lower credits compensation. For example a call from a mobile device might result in a higher payout as calculated by the system than an inbound call from a fixed wireline. Optionally the payout for generating leads into the marketing funnel is spread across members and their recruiters.

In another example embodiment the integrated marketing automation and telephony platform can be used to track and manage broad geographic e.g. nationwide marketing advertising campaigns in which sales eventually transact at a local geographic level. For example an MLM merchant might advertise their product nationally. Users interested in the product might click through an advertisement displayed online and or call a toll free number e.g. a ring pool number displayed in an online and or offline advertisement. Optionally the platform determines implicitly e.g. via the customer s calling number ip address geo location etc. or by a customer s explicit declaration e.g. entry of their area code or zip code at some interaction point in the sales process indicating the customer s geographic location. Optionally the platform uses the geo location as a parameter potentially one of many parameters another parameter for example the amount a downline member might bid for leads in the assignment of a downline member in the MLM to the customer.

The PM system provides for the capabilities of a Network Manager to configure and manage ad sales campaigns on behalf of an advertiser. illustrates an example embodiment view and edit company profile web page for the PM system that can be used by an advertiser to setup a Networked Managed account. Optionally a manager creates accounts and or a company profile which then can be used by the Network manager or others within the organization. Optionally the manager creates an account by entering a Merchant name in the text field . Optionally the manager can assign a company identifier to the account. A company identifier can be used for example in cases in which the manager intends to keep the company name anonymous and or if there are multiple accounts within the company.

Optionally an Ad identifier is assigned by the PM system and displayed in an Ad identifier display . Optionally an Ad identifier is obtained from the Network Partner and entered into the Ad identifier field . An Ad identifier is used to create an association between an Ad and an advertiser see also creative submodule above . Optionally the manager can select a product or service category from a scroll menu see description of scroll menu . Optionally the manager can configure one or more account settings. Optionally the manager can select the Can view call fees setting which causes network charges associated with calls to be visible to the personnel viewing the reports.

Optionally the manager can select the Network managed setting to configure the account to be Network managed as described above. The manager can also configure the view publisher setting which enables personnel to view details associated with publisher including for example the profile information associated with the publisher affiliates and publisher affiliate reports e.g. affiliate publisher payout reports . If the account is Network managed the manager optionally can also create a bundled advertising campaign by selecting the Create bundled publisher setting which is described below. Optionally the web page includes an update control which when selected updates the company profile account with the data entered by the manager in the PM system database.

Optionally the PM system provides tools for Network managers or advertisers or publishers to bundle campaigns together which are promoting similar products or services. The bundling campaign feature simplifies campaign management for a Network manager. For example if two beverage advertisers are promoting soft drinks where advertiser 1 is promoting orange soda and advertiser 2 is promoting grape soda a Network manager can bundle the two campaigns into a single campaign. An advertiser makes a request to a Network to manage their advertising campaigns and the Network manager configures the two campaigns together to streamline the campaign creation steps and manage the allocation of calls from affiliates publishers fairly across the bundled campaigns. Creating a bundled campaign is similar to the process for creating a regular campaign however the Call treatment step differs.

In creating a bundled campaign the Network manager first selects the bundle control in the Company Profile web page within the advertiser s account for example advertiser 1 see . In the Call treatment step 2 of campaign creation the Network manager selects the round robin option from the menu scroll control see . Round Robin Transfer in a bundled campaign ensures each campaign within the bundle is treated fairly resulting in substantially the same amount of calls being routed to all campaigns in the bundle. For example in the bundled beverage campaign configuring round robin causes half of the call traffic to be directed to the orange soda call center with the other half directed to the grape soda call center. Optionally different call distribution methods can be used including but not limited to round robin last in first out first in last out highest activity lowest activity. Optionally the round robin probabilities can be weighted based on other criteria such as payouts conversion rates geographic proximity budgets call caps etc. In an example embodiment a choose best option is selected that causes at least in part the system to route inbound calls based on financial consideration. For example when the network manager selects the choose best option the system may route the call to the advertiser who pays the most for the call. By way of further example the choose best option may be configured so that when the network manager selects the choose best option the system may route the call to enhance or maximize the yield for the network and or the publisher media partner whose advertisement caused the call.

After selecting round robin call distribution the Network manager adds one or more destination campaigns by selecting the add destination control . For each destination the Network manager selects a named advertising campaign from the pull down menu control . The pull down menu control includes a listing of the campaigns directly managed by the Network manager and included in the bundle. The other web controls of are described with respect to . After the bundled campaigns are created affiliates publishers access the campaigns and begin promoting the goods and or services of the campaigns. In bundled campaigns the affiliates publishers may promote goods and or services in a manner which does not distinguish the specifics of the underlying good and or service to avoid caller confusion since calls are distributed across the bundled campaigns . In our beverage example affiliates publishers would promote soda not grape soda or orange soda. Optionally bundled campaigns can also be used in the context of MLM campaigns such as those described above in which for example calls are distributed across downline members and or parameters such as geographic location are used at least in part to distribute calls to downline members.

Custom RingPools enable a campaign manager user and publishers to track online sources that are driving traffic to their campaigns. With Custom RingPools multiple text string for example the use of three text strings is described with respect to an example embodiment below are passed to the PM system in a web transaction that can be used to identify the traffic source driving a specific call. The Publisher Affiliate configures certain parameters and significant values as described in the example embodiment web pages below.

In configuring RingPools for the web the campaign manager first decides where web traffic is to land in response to an ad selection by a consumer using different options. For example the traffic can be sent to an advertiser s landing page or the traffic can be directed to an affiliate s publisher s landing page. The landing page optionally provides additional information on the advertisement of interest to the consumer. With RingPools the landing page displays a dynamically allocated RingPool phone address. As shown in the affiliate publisher advertiser can optionally configure RingPool phone addresses to be displayed on an advertiser s landing web page by selecting the Advertiser landing page control . Optionally advertisers affiliates or publishers can use the RingPool API discussed below by selecting the My application or website control . Optionally the user interface includes website setting navigation controls which enable the user to advance to the next configuration step web page.

As shown in affiliates publishers advertisers can optionally configure RingPool phone addresses to be used in paid search ad campaigns or in a traditional online advertising campaign. In the case of paid search the affiliate or publisher selects the control or depending upon whether a Search RingPool or Keyword ID Search RingPool is to be used. A Keyword ID Search is used in paid search where the media buyer affiliates publishers advertisers assigns a single identifier to a group of similar keywords. This is also referred to as an ad group. In this case the PM system tracks and reports at the group level rather than at the individual keyword level. The affiliate or publisher can choose any combination of parameters known to the PM system at that point including any parameters in the referring URL e.g. search engine query string Sub affiliate identifiers traffic source identifiers and parameters passed to the landing page including keyword id and any browser cookies. If the ad campaign is not search related the campaign manager selects the Custom RingPools option . Optionally the user interface includes website setting navigation controls and which enable the user to return to the previous page or advance to the next page respectively.

For both Custom and Search RingPools the campaign manager configures RingPool settings as shown in . Optionally the campaign manager assigns a name to the RingPool by entering a descriptive name into the text field . The RingPool name is used in reporting and may be used to distinguish multiple RingPools within a given campaign. Next the campaign manager optionally assigns a RingPool minimum duration threshold in the pull down menu e.g. 10 minutes 2 days etc. . A phone address assigned from a RingPool is not reassigned reused until the minimum duration time period has been exceeded and the phone addresses within the number pool have been exhausted. If a phone address pool is exhausted and all phone address assignments have occurred within the minimum duration time period an overflow number is assigned by the PM system.

The campaign manager estimates the number of click throughs the campaign generates and enters the value in the number field . The PM system uses this estimate to determine the number of RingPool numbers to allocate to the campaign and displays the allocation in the display field . For example the PM system can assign the number of RingPool numbers to equal the number of click throughs in a day or week. Optionally the PM system can assign a number of RingPool numbers using a percentage of click throughs and further based upon historical estimates and comparative actual usage. Optionally the system allocates a fixed number of RingPools to a campaign and the user adjusts the number of phone addresses required based upon reporting feedback as shown in the example . Other assignment and allocation techniques are also described above. Optionally the user interface includes website setting navigation controls and which enable the user to return to the previous page or advance to the next page respectively.

In order for the PM system to track each ad placement on an affiliate s or publisher s web site s the campaign manager uniquely identifies each ad. This identification is accomplished by the campaign manager assigning one or more parameters or identifiers to each ad. For example these identifiers are passed to the PM system when a user selects the ad and a corresponding RingPool phone address is assigned. Because each ad is uniquely identified in this example each ad can be tracked individually. Optionally the campaign manager can aggregate tracking and use the same RingPool phone address across multiple ads by using the same parameters on certain ads. Although the number of parameters used in this example embodiment is limited to three additional parameters e.g. 10 parameters can be used.

For Custom RingPools the campaign manager specifies from one to three unique names in the parameter fields see . Optionally the user interface includes website setting navigation controls and which enable the user to return to the previous page or advance to the next page respectively.

After configuring Custom RingPools the PM system displays a general tracking link to be used by the publisher and or affiliate as shown in . The campaign manager user can replace each click through URL with the general tracking link and set the parameters to unique values see . Or optionally they can keep their existing tracking URL and web integration code which runs on the page which can extract the parameters. With the parameters configured to unique values the PM system tracks and reports on the click throughs and RingPool phone address associations see also example embodiment State 63 below for an example use of parameters . RingPool parameters can be anything available to the call tracking system including parameters in the URL like keywords or keyword ids parameters in the referring URL like search engine and search query parameters from cookies set on the consumer s browser earlier or parameters passed from a partner through the RingPool API described below including for example a loyalty id or mobile phone info phone device carrier geo location etc. . The advertiser publisher affiliate can use this information to determine the effectiveness of each ad placement.

Optionally the system presents a Mobile Click to Call selection control . If the user selects this option the consumer experience is slightly modified if the consumer is viewing the ad on a smartphone device. In this case the PM system causes a pop up dialer to appear on the smartphone with the RingPool number pre populated captures associated mobile browser and or user information e.g. cookies or their equivalent and the mobile browser redirects to the advertiser s landing page in the background. This Mobile Click to Call configuration does not alter the consumer experience if the click through is performed using a conventional computer. Optionally the user interface includes website setting navigation controls and which enable the user to return to the previous page or exit RingPool configuration steps respectively. Optionally independent of the mobile click to call selection here the advertiser or publisher who controls the landing page may choose to have that page display phone numbers using mobile click to call.

Optionally no phone numbers are required in the case of click to call on a mobile phone as the tracking data can be passed over the data network to the PM system. The consumer s phone number may not be readily available but can be inferred by correlating other data e.g. identify data received from an application running on the mobile device of the user . Another option is to direct the mobile phone to call a network based server of the PM system which can analyze the call signaling information to correlate a mobile phone ID to the user s actual phone number this server does not have to even answer the call because signaling data is presented to the server when the call is received.

In another example embodiment a phone number e.g. a RingPool number is not required such as in the case when an app on a mobile device is utilized as the connection data can be passed over the data network to the system e.g. via the app . For example a merchant business e.g. WalMart offering a branded application can integrate with and or create a VoIP connection with the call bridging platform thus obviating the need for a phone number see also configurable customizable app development disclosure in the Marketing Automation section below . The consumer s phone number may not be readily available but may be inferred by correlating other data e.g. by identifying data received from the application running on the mobile device of the user . Optionally the application accesses the phone dialer and places a call e.g. to a RingPool number in response to a command request from the customer customer prospect.

Search RingPools enable a campaign manager user to track online offline and or mobile sources that are driving traffic to their campaigns. With Search RingPools a text string is passed to the PM system in response to a click through on a paid search ad. The text string is used to identify the traffic source. The campaign manager advertiser publisher or affiliate configures certain parameters and significant values as described in the example embodiment web pages below.

For Search RingPools the configuration process is similar to that described for Custom ring pools. The campaign manager selects where the RingPool numbers are to be displayed including for example the advertiser s landing page or a publisher s website see description of above . Next the campaign manager selects which RingPool type search keyword ID search or custom see description of above . Next the campaign manager selects RingPool settings see description of above . Unlike the configuration setting for Custom RingPools Search RingPools do not need the campaign manager to define parameters. In effect search is a simplified method to automatically obtain parameters from the referring URL. Optionally the PM system creates one or more default parameters. For example a parameter 1 may be set to the purchased keyword phrase and a parameter 2 may be set to the search engine used.

After establishing RingPool settings the system responds to the manager s configuration settings by displaying a general tracking link the campaign manager uses in any paid search ads. Similar to Custom Ring Pools if the click through URL is replaced with the general tracking link consumers clicking on the paid search Ad are directed to the defined landing page with a RingPool phone address displayed on the website. Optionally the campaign manager uses web integration code described below as an alternative to URL replacement.

The configuration process for an example RingPool Application Programming Interface is now described. Custom and Search RingPools described above enable advertisers affiliates and publishers to use web integration code to transit redirect through the PM system where a phone address is received prior to displaying a landing page. With the use of the RingPool API advertisers affiliates and publishers can make a direct programmatic request for a RingPool phone address without having to redirect through the PM system. The RingPool API optionally supports custom search and Keyword ID search RingPools. The process of configuring RingPool API s is very similar to the steps described above for the three types of RingPools.

The steps of configuring a RingPool API are similar to that described above for Custom and Search see Figure descriptions above . After configuring RingPools through the parameter steps the system responds to the manager s configuration settings by displaying a unique RingPool key which is used by the campaign manager in configuring the RingPool API see input parameters below .

Advertisers also can allocate RingPool phone addresses on behalf of affiliates and publishers in order to credit them for calls. In this case advertisers include an affiliate or publisher ID in the RingPool API in addition to the key described above.

Optionally the RingPool API returns a RingPool phone address and a formatted click through URL. The response can be in any number of formats including for example xml EXtensible Markup Language json JavaScript Object Notation or csv Comma Separated Values .

Optionally the PM system supports pixel tracking whereby a pixel can be configured to fire when certain criteria have been met in association with a call. Optionally Firing a pixel means to retrieve the pixel from its URL as if a browser had rendered a page that contained that pixel in its content. The parameters to be tracked are contained in the URL. Many conventional systems use the approach for tracking online user actions. This enables users of the system e.g. publishers and advertisers to integrate conversion performance and reporting into their existing ad serving infrastructure. Pixel tracking is configured via one or more user interface display screens in which a user associates a campaign to a set of criteria including for example all transactions all calls paid calls sales from web sales from calls etc. In addition the user specifies the specific pixel URL to be fired when a transaction and or call meets the defined criteria. Optionally the system substitutes one or more parameters into the pixel URL as specified by the user including for example 

In the description above the advertisers publishers affiliates are responsible for embedding integrating code which maps trackable phone numbers from the PM system provider into their landing pages home pages. Optionally the PM system hosts the landing pages home pages. This PM hosting approach provides certain advantages to the advertisers publishers affiliates including for example removing the need for advertisers publishers affiliates to embed integrate code on their web site alleviating technical issues related to web site compatibility etc. Optionally the PM system utilizes cloud computing based services to host the advertisers publishers affiliates landing home page. Optionally the PM system utilizes a web proxy layer similar to Amazon Silk that precomputes caches web pages to further improve the consumer web surfer response experience. These precomputed cached landing pages loaded in the background before the consumer web surfer clicks on the link to the page optionally include trackable phone numbers.

More specifically the Web Integration Code is optionally Javascript which an Advertiser or Publisher includes on their web page s that receive traffic. It has one required parameter that identifies the Advertiser or Publisher who is hosting it. It also has optional parameters for them to set preferences for example how they like to see phone numbers formatted. It is designed to run unobtrusively gathering the pertinent browser visible information such as current URL referring URL cookies mobile settings etc. and passing this information asynchronously to the PM system. The PM system uses that information to decide which tracking number if any should be shown on their web page. The PM system returns this tracking number and the Web Integration Code optionally inserts and or replaces existing phone numbers on their web page with the tracking phone number. Optionally other page elements can be shown or hidden to facilitate a different look or a different call to action like Call now when a tracking phone number is present.

Conventionally web browsers limit such asynchronous access to have a URL with the same domain as the current page URL. This would be inconvenient as it would require the Advertiser to host the PM code or proxy it through the Advertiser s servers. To address this the Web Integration Code sends its request to the PM system and receives its response by rewriting the page using a convention like JSON P.

The marketing of goods and services via the Internet continues to evolve. An early Internet marketing channel included direct email marketing. Today there are various marketing channels that can be used to promote goods and services including for example blogs social networking web page visits search etc. Coincident with online marketing channel evolution is the emergence of software based tools that are focused on automating the marketing process within these various channels. This automation includes marketing campaign creation launch tracking and reporting. While early and generally rudimentary marketing automation tools were initially developed by a company internally to facilitate marketing of the products they developed more recently an industry of third party outsourced marketing automation tools has emerged including for example companies such as NetSuite Salesforce Eloqua etc. that provide more sophisticated tools that may be used in conjunction with certain online marketing channels and are capable of providing tracking and reporting. Disadvantageously the conventional marketing automation tools provided by these third parties are generally limited to the online Internet medium have not been able to address the challenges posed by telephony integration and provide limited or no telephony integration.

What is needed is user and system friendly integration of voice and fax telephony into marketing automation software computing platforms. Conventionally for example a product manufacturer might use a marketing automation system to create an email marketing campaign. To add telephony features to the campaign the manufacturer must manually create a parallel and separate telephony campaign to work in conjunction with the defined email marketing campaign. The lack of an integrated campaign generally results in campaign errors cumbersome reporting and account access difficulties in monitoring and adapting active campaigns wasted effort and expense etc.

Systems and methods for a marketing automation system which includes integrated telephony are described. Optionally the marketing automation system is provided by a single provider to an end user. Optionally the marketing automation system is provided by a conventional marketing automation platform provider and the telephony features are provided by a separate applications provider which may be configured to integrate with the marketing automation platform. In the latter case the application optionally purchased or licensed separately is hosted and operates within the database and infrastructure of the conventional marketing automation platform.

The creation launch tracking and analysis reporting of a marketing campaign involve a number of states. Examples of such states in the creation of an example marketing campaign program are discussed below with reference to example aspects of telephony integration.

Before a sales campaign can be launched it needs to be designed by for example a marketing manager. Campaign design includes but is not limited to establishing target sales objectives choosing campaign offline online media and channels defining campaign elements campaign messages etc. Optionally the defined campaign elements and or media elements include for example direct mail templates email templates web landing pages web forms web ads search video programs mobile ads social media microblogging social network account virtual events etc. as further listed and described below .

Optionally the defined campaign element and or media element are assigned a phone address by a user operator via the marketing automation platform. Optionally the defined campaign element and or media element are assigned a phone address automatically by the marketing automation platform. Optionally the automatic assignment of a phone address to a campaign and or media element occurs at least partly in response to a triggering event or condition. Example triggering conditions may include but are not limited to the media elements described elsewhere herein with respect to lead scoring and lead nurturing. For example a triggering event or condition may include the display of a web based landing page to a customer prospect or the download of an application or media by a customer prospect. The triggering event or condition of a number assignment and which type of phone address to use e.g. toll free or local can further be configured by an operator via a set of filters or additional conditions which are established based at least in part upon information collected known or accessible by the marketing automation platform about the customer prospect e.g. explicit and implicit attributes used in lead scoring and or a lead score as described elsewhere herein . For example in a marketing campaign if the customer prospect is known or determined to be younger than seventeen a customer prospect attribute a phone address may not be assigned a filter in an initial introductory email a media element or only a toll free number might be assigned a type of phone address . Optionally as further described herein the campaign media elements triggering events or conditions customer attributes lead scores etc. are used to fixedly or dynamically e.g. in substantially real time route inbound and outbound calls to configured destinations phone addresses. Further with respect to the assignment of a phone address to a marketing campaign optionally a phone address is manually assigned by an operator user and or the phone address is automatically assigned to a stage in a marketing campaign wherein stages in a marketing campaign and or marketing funnel can include but are not limited to one or more of the following stages a null state e.g. a state prior to campaign entry pre launch campaign or staging state e.g. a customer prospect including a customer account placed and or selected for a campaign marketing funnel states campaign exit states and or other marketing campaign states that may be utilized in marketing automation. Optionally a customer prospect transitions through marketing campaign states and or stages of the marketing campaign in response to certain user operator actions e.g. placing customer prospect leads into a marketing campaign certain determined attributes of the customer prospect and or attributes associated with a subscriber triggering campaign event e.g. campaign media element presentation campaign promotion delivery marketing campaign stage state timeout etc. and or the detection of certain customer prospect actions e.g. detecting that the customer prospect has selected an online promotion downloaded a white paper placed a phone call etc. as further described herein.

Optionally in the campaign design stage the user also defines and or configures dashboards and reports to be used during the campaign. Optionally the user also plans for one or more test offers optionally including A B testing. Optionally at this stage or at another stage the integration of voice and fax telephony services is included in the campaign definition. For example at this stage of the marketing funnel phone addresses are presented placed in the online and or offline media e.g. television advertisements radio advertisements newspapers etc. . Optionally phone services are included in initial emails to the target customers. Optionally phone services are used later in the funnel for example on a web landing page after the customer prospect has clicked on a link in one or more emails that causes the landing page to be presented to the user via a user browser hosted on a user terminal. Optionally inbound calls to displayed phone numbers addresses are routed to a call center or an inbound sales center through a call processing platform.

Once a campaign is designed one or more campaigns can be created or defined. A user for example a marketing manager accesses over a data network an automated marketing system using for example a web browser a dedicated application or otherwise. The user is assigned a unique identity within one or more accounts of the automated marketing system. The user enters a unique identifier and or password to gain access to the automated marketing system.

After authentication by the system optionally the automation system presents a user interface for example a dashboard or home page enabling the user to among other things create a marketing campaign by selecting for example an account marketing module user interface tab or control. The user identifies the campaign for example by entering an identifier for the campaign although the identifier may be entered or edited later in the process .

The marketing manager configures the campaign into the system. The following example embodiments of a marketing automation system illustrate various example types of marketing campaigns campaign tactics campaign metrics and associated system features in various marketing channels in conjunction with discussions regarding telephony integration.

Once a marketing campaign is created the marketing manager operator agent enters customer prospects into the marketing campaign for example via a user interface of the marketing automation platform. For example customer prospects may optionally be entered into a campaign for campaign targeting by importing a list of email addresses instant message addresses and or telephone addresses associated with the customer prospects. Optionally customer prospects for a marketing campaign are entered by the operator selecting existing customers from for example a list by selecting a database of customer prospects e.g. operated by a third party or maintained by the marketing automation platform and or by the operator defining certain characteristics attributes of customers or customer prospects e.g. gender age household income marital status education ethnicity location interests etc. in a query.

Optionally the operator selects customer either existing customers or customer prospect attributes from a user interface display of attributes e.g. a menu of attributes or via entry into a field s of one or more search data base queries. Optionally once the operator defines a criterion or a set of criteria the marketing automation system platform automatically enters one or more e.g. all customers meeting the criteria into the marketing campaign. Optionally the criteria and or circumstance for entering a customer prospect into a marketing campaign can include but is not limited to one or more of the following examples or any specified combination thereof a customer prospect visit to a specific web site a customer prospect action at a website a customer prospect action in an application including any network based application such as a smartphone application a social media interaction e.g. a visit to a social media page a social media like a messaging event on a social media page keywords used on a social media page the receipt of a communication e.g. an instant message a social networking message an email a text message an SMS MMS message etc. an application download the detected determined location of a user e.g. using the GPS of a customer prospects mobile computing device e.g. a tablet computer a mobile phone etc. a telephony communication event e.g. an inbound call from the customer prospect an outbound call to a customer prospect a video call a Facetime session a Skype or other VoIP call a received fax etc. etc. Other example triggering conditions criteria and circumstance for entering a user customer prospect into a campaign are discussed below including for example lead scoring conditions. Optionally a user customer prospect may be entered into a campaign e.g. in response to a triggering event as described herein in association with an available or accessible e.g. via an internal or external data store access user customer prospect identifier including for example one or more of a user customer prospect s email address Internet Protocol address cookie a persistent unique identifier home phone address home address business address business phone line mobile phone address etc. Optionally in the event that the system determines an identifier may not be accessible or available for a user customer prospect the system may automatically assign an identifier to the user customer prospect such as a user customer prospect account number by way of example. Optionally additional user customer prospect identification information is determined through the course of the campaign and said additional identification information is optionally stored in association with the available accessible and or assigned campaign identifier. For example a phone call to a RingPool phone address uniquely assigned in the campaign to a user customer prospect enables the system to associate and store the received call signaling information including for example a caller phone address associated with the incoming call with the available accessible and or assigned campaign identifier.

Optionally a notice of a social media action by the system may occur over a data network. Optionally the system and the social media system are coupled over a data network via one or more Application Programming Interfaces APIs . Optionally the system monitors a Webpage of the social media system for changes using for example web robots or bots which run automated searches and or screen scrapes. The system may compare the content of a current version of Webpage with the content of previous version of the Webpage captured or accessed by the system to identify such changes.

Optionally a detected software program application interaction e.g. where the software program application may be a software program application of an advertiser which may be downloaded to and hosted on an Internet connected computing device of a user customer prospect may trigger a campaign event e.g. adding a customer prospect to a campaign or a campaign state transition . Examples of software program application interactions may include for example a user interface control selection of the application a rating of the application or any other application events including for example time period of use number of application opens a reconfiguration of the application a user customer prospect application profile change an application upgrade change of application content a geographic location or a geographic location change etc.

Optionally a notice of a software program application interaction may occur over a data network. Optionally the system and the application software program are coupled over a data network via one or more Application Programming Interfaces APIs . Optionally keywords detected in a communication between two or more parties are used as a triggering event to enter a customer prospect into a marketing campaign associated with such keywords e.g. wherein an operator has specified keywords that are to be associated with the campaign and the system stores the keywords and association . As an illustration an operator of a social network might monitor messaging communications between users of their social network. If a keyword barbeque is detected all users in the messaging communication may be entered into a marketing campaign for barbeque supplies and or accessories. Similarly in an audio communication automated speech recognition may be used to detect certain specified keywords and if a specified keyword is detected the user is entered as a customer prospect into one or more marketing campaigns.

Optionally a unique identity and or account are created for each customer prospect. Optionally an identifier handle used by the marketing automation system to register a customer prospect is relatively minimalistic such as a customer prospect s geographic location or the customer s email address. Optionally the marketing automation system assigns a unique account customer number identifier to the customer prospect. Optionally in response to an explicit customer registration e.g. customer prospect entering of a customer login id and or password an account is created and optionally an account number identifier is assigned to the account.

Optionally a call to a phone address associated with a marketing campaign optionally including a Ring Pool phone address triggers one or more scheduled events or response events. Scheduled events or response events may optionally include but are not limited to one or more of the following or any specified combination thereof a phone call or return phone call e.g. a return call from a sales person or call agent a conference call with one or more participants a social media chat session an instant message iMessage or other messaging chat session a Short Message Service Multi Media Message Service message or reply a FaceTime Skype or other video based call sessions or return call session facsimile call response or other communication reply or origination described herein.

An example embodiment of an automated marketing campaign is now described. In this example embodiment the campaign is based at least in part upon demand generation using outbound email.

A user for example a marketing manager logs into the system and is authenticated as described above. The user selects or enters an identifier for the campaign via the marketing automation system e.g. one or more servers and associated marketing automation application software . Optionally the user configures the marketing campaign by for example selecting a navigation control such as campaign creation tab. Optionally the user interface includes a number features including for example drag and drop menu selections short cut keys auto fill etc. to for example simplify campaign management and editing.

Optionally the user enters customer prospects by configuring into the campaign one or more email campaign lists from a data store of lists. Optionally the user associates one or more emails e.g. email templates with the one or more email campaign lists. Optionally the user configures e.g. via a user interface control a phone number into the one or more email templates with the one or more email campaign lists. With respect to number configuration a number e.g. a single number is for example configured or assigned by the marketing automation software in response to a user request. Alternatively a user configures or selects a single number from a list of numbers e.g. vanity numbers or easy to remember phone numbers to be used in the campaign. Alternatively a different number selected from a pool of numbers e.g. a Ring Pool is used for each template with the one or more email campaign lists. Optionally a different number selected from a pool of numbers e.g. a Ring Pool is used for each template and for each email campaign list. Optionally a different number selected from a pool of numbers e.g. a Ring Pool is used for each template and for each email campaign list or sub campaign list where a sub campaign list includes certain attributes e.g. sub campaign lists relating to unique user demographics user behavior funnel stage etc. . In the marketing automation system each phone number may act as a unique identifier enabling the marketing automation system to track manage record and or transcribe phone based customer interactions offline interactions throughout the campaign based on calls involving the phone number. Optionally the phone number and other attributes for example the calling party s number together form the unique identifier to facilitate tracking and campaign management.

Optionally the marketing automation system includes libraries of historical or pre built marketing programs e.g. best practice marketing programs including by way of example attached email and landing page templates. Optionally these program libraries include integrated telephony features and number assignments as described elsewhere herein. Optionally selected portions of or entire marketing programs optionally including multiple email campaigns and multiple landing pages can be cloned and edited and new and or unique numbers are automatically assigned to the cloned marketing program.

Optionally different phone numbers and or different phone number pools can be associated with different date and time triggers within the same marketing program. For example a phone number can be modified or selected for insertion in an email template based on a send date and time.

Optionally phone number assignments tracking and or reporting can be modified during the execution of the marketing program without disrupting the campaign itself. Optionally call management and call treatment as discussed elsewhere herein e.g. dynamic call routing to a backup call center may also be performed without campaign disruption.

Many or most sales do not occur in response to a customer prospect s first interaction with a company. Generally there are multiple customer prospect interactions before a customer decides to purchase a product or service. Conventionally marketing campaigns include a series of one or more actions to build a relationship with a customer prospect in order to get the customer prospect to actually purchase the product or service. Certain example embodiments described herein perform relationship building by providing high quality personalized information in a timely manner through a set of stages in a campaign. Optionally unique phone numbers are used in the presentation of information to the customer prospect in association with the customized personalized information at a given campaign stage.

An example embodiment of automated marketing lead nurturing with integrated telephony is now described. In the lead nurturing example embodiment a series of actions occur in response to triggering events and or time period transitions. Optionally a customer prospect is entered into a campaign in response to a triggering event as further described above . Optionally upon entry into a nurturing and or marketing campaign one or more phone addresses are associated with the customer prospect and are attached to customer prospect communications. For example a unique and or ring pool number can be included in an introductory or initial response email or SMS MMS communication. Optionally as further described herein offline online calls to the phone address are used to automatically associate the call and the call results with the customer prospect or customer prospects if a phone address is used in association with a group or category of customer prospects . For example the called party phone address in the call signaling information of the received call is compared against a list or pool of assigned phone addresses. If the comparison results in a match the customer prospect s is determined to be associated with the assigned phone address and such association is stored in memory. Optionally a user interface of the marketing automation system enables an agent or operator to modify the phone address to customer prospect binding for example by selecting a user interface control e.g. a control to remove a customer prospect from the association a control to add a new customer prospect etc. . Optionally a customer prospect becomes a customer and exits the particular nurturing and or marketing campaign once the customer prospect has purchased a product or service. Optionally a customer prospect is manually removed from a nurturing and or marketing campaign manually via a user interface control of the marketing automation platform. Optionally the customer prospect is automatically removed from the nurturing and or marketing campaign by the marketing automation platform in response to the detection of the sale. Optionally the type of call received and or the content of the call and or message determine a triggering event. For example the receipt of a fax from a customer or the detection of a signature in a received fax from a customer triggers an exit from a campaign.

In a first stage e.g. day 1 an introductory email is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and sent to a customer prospect. It is understood that while the following example may refer to an email communication the communication may be instead or in addition be an instant message a short messaging service message e.g. an SMS or MMS message etc. Optionally the introductory email has a first phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls originated to the first phone number transition through a call bridging system which places a second call to a call sales center by way of example. Optionally the calls terminate on a call processing switching center or fax processing server directly within the call sales organization. Optionally in either example call processing scenario data about the caller the call including a recording of the call and information associated with the call and or the call results is stored in one or more data stores e.g. a database . Optionally the call data can be mined by the system for certain keywords and or phrases which indicate a purchase intent by a customer prospect. The term keyword is optionally a single word or a multiple word phrase or other vocal expression such as an affirmative grunt. Optionally a purchase intent reflects a likelihood that the customer prospect will be a customer for a good or service promoted in a marketing campaign program. Optionally voice communications are translated into text and the text data mined. Optionally voice communications are analyzed in substantially and or near real time for keywords and or phrases using a voice speech recognition module. Optionally the call data can be mined and the prospect can be retargeted in a campaign as described below or in a subsequent campaigns. For example a recording and or transcription of the call can be data mined for certain keywords. For example if a prospect displays an interest in baseball e.g. the prospect mentions the keyword baseball in a call with an agent the prospect can be placed in a baseball season ticket campaign. In another example if a prospect declines to pay using a credit debit card or indicates the lack of a credit debit card the prospect can be placed in a credit card enrollment campaign. In another example if the customer prospect expresses a purchase intent e.g. the customer prospect uses the keywords buy credit card yes I would like to buy . . . bill me etc. but does not make a purchase during the call the customer prospect might be retargeted in a special offer discount marketing campaign to encourage the customer prospect to make the purchase. Advantageously the call bridging and voice recognition capabilities of the system can distinguish those words and phrases spoken by the customer prospect e.g. caller by recording and or transcription eavesdropping on the voice data channel directed to the customer prospect e.g. the voice channel associated with a bridged inbound call or outbound call from or to respectively the customer prospect from those spoken by the agent advertiser e.g. the voice channel associated with a bridged inbound call or outbound call from or to respectively the agent advertiser . Optionally data mining analysis and or simple keyword spotting can also be used to facilitate the creation of a call report e.g. a sale report summary alleviating the need for the sales person and or call center agent to file a formal sales report on each call. In another example if the customer prospect and or sales agent expresses a purchase intent e.g. the customer prospect uses the keywords buy credit card yes I would like to buy . . . bill me etc. the call report status optionally indicates a registered sale. In another example if the customer prospect faxes in a signed document the detection of a signature on the signature page optionally indicates a registered sale. Optionally call recording transcription data mining can be applied by the system to outbound calls in addition to inbound calls. Optionally outbound calls are originated via a client application e.g. a network connected application which is downloaded or is preinstalled on a sales agent s fixed and or mobile computing device including for example an agent s smartphone and or workstation. Optionally outbound calls are initiated by the user selecting a phone number from a contact database a customer prospect list or entry by the user via a user interface of the client application. Optionally the telephony subsystem of the marketing automation platform generates a bridged call one to the agent and another to the customer prospect in response to a selection by the customer prospect. Optionally the client application e.g. network connected application provides call status e.g. connecting ringing etc. via a call display on outbound inbound calls. Optionally the network connected application provides implicit and explicit information see description below relating to the calling party on an inbound outbound call. Optionally the inbound or outbound call information and call status or a portion thereof is provided on a display user interface e.g. web browser generated by the marketing automation platform. For example caller identification information relating to an inbound call can be presented in the client application while additional implicit and explicit information e.g. customer prospects program state see also descriptions below relating to the call can be provided on a screen user interface e.g. a web browser of the marketing automation platform. Optionally a pre call session is presented to the sales agent which captures important contextual data relating to the sales call and can be used to generate an automatic sales call report. Optionally an Interactive Voice Response IVR session is presented to the sales agent during the pre call session to facilitate sales call report data collection. Optionally the IVR session is paced and responses are entered via spoken and or dtmf commands. Optionally the pre call session can by skipped and or terminated by a spoken and or dtmf command. Optionally upon detection of the customer prospect called or calling party terminating the call e.g. hang up the system prompts the user for a post call session to facilitate automated sales call reporting. Optionally as with a pre call session a post call session optionally uses an IVR session to facilitate data collection. Optionally the pre and post call session recording and entered responses are stored in association with the customer prospect s account. Optionally the sessions e.g. pre call call and post call recordings are transcribed and stored in association with the customer prospect s account. Optionally as further discussed below an inbound call from and or outbound call to a customer prospect results in the marketing automation platform automatically changing the state of the account e.g. changes a prospect s lead score . Optionally the sales agent can change the state of the account and or recommend a specific action e.g. schedule an appointment set a reminder alert escalate account to manager etc. in a pre or post call. Optionally the next step actions for a customer prospect are prompted via an IVR user interface and or the sales agent is directed to speak a next step action. Optionally additional information associated with the next step action is collected during the post call session e.g. an appointment time and date if an appointment schedule action is selected .

Further with respect to retargeting a customer or customer prospect in an example embodiment an inbound call to a RingPool number from a customer prospect is associated by the marketing automation platform with a specific online media placement. The data regarding these associations may be provided or made available to marketers and or the marketing automation platform for subsequent online advertisements e.g. retargeting . In an illustrative example a customer prospect views an advertisement regarding an airline s sale on flights to Tahiti but does not take an online action e.g. does not click on the ad . Instead the customer prospect calls the displayed RingPool phone number in the Tahiti sale advertisement or selects an option on the customer prospect s mobile device to place a call to the displayed number . The marketing automation platform receives the inbound call and records stores in the marketing automation platform the customer prospect s interest in flights to Tahiti. In this example the marketing automation platform associates the online session with the offline call e.g. by associating the association of the web session and the RingPool phone number as similarly discussed above . If retargeting is enabled subsequent visits by the customer prospect e.g. optionally determined by using an http cookie to the airline s web site and or other campaign s including search term marketing campaigns cause additional Tahiti sale advertisements to be displayed to the customer prospect. Optionally the recording and or transcription of the offline call is data mined for certain keywords to determine whether the advertisements media placements can be further customized to the specific customer prospect. In the example above an analysis of the call determines that the customer is interested in flights originating from Los Angeles e.g. the keywords Departure and Los Angeles were detected during the offline call . Subsequent advertisement presentations by the airline and or its affiliates to the customer prospect might describe the advantages of direct flights from Los Angeles and or special fares from Los Angeles to Tahiti. In another example of data mining the call interaction the caller may have expressed an interest to travel in the month of November e.g. the keyword November was detected during the call . Subsequent advertisement presentation by the airline and or its affiliates to the customer prospect might describe the weather in November in Tahiti and or a special fare from Los Angeles to Tahiti in November. Advantageously the marketing automation system can associate an offline transaction e.g. a phone call with an offline presentation e.g. a displayed advertisement for retargeting and further enables marketing personnel operators to use data mining techniques on speech and or text transcription data to customize the advertisements to the prospects need e.g. solution to their problem . In the example and description above the term offline was used to describe a conventional wireline or mobile call and was not meant to limit the types of calls or and type of devices calls can originate from customer prospects when viewing online mobile advertisements and retargeted by the marketing automation platform. Optionally calls can include VoIP calls e.g. Skype and can originate from a customer prospect s fixed and or mobile devices.

With respect to inbound calls to call center agents e.g. sales agents and outbound calls from call center agents e.g. sales agents some or all calls are optionally recorded. As described herein optionally the system distinguishes the customer prospect s voice channel e.g. an inbound call leg from a customer prospect in a bridged call from the call center agent s voice channel e.g. an outbound call leg to a call center agent in a bridged call . Optionally some or all transcriptions of the recorded calls include notations for their respective speaker e.g. customer prospect or sales agent or sales agent s if more than one agent is conferenced on the call . Optionally the call recordings are stored in association with the customer prospect s account and or the sales agent account record. Optionally the marketing automation platform data mines the recorded transcribed calls and assigns a score such as a numeric or alpha score e.g. a sales agent call performance score to each call based upon one or more attributes of the call including for example one or more of the following the outcome of the call e.g. a sale keyword spotting of the call e.g. buy purchase not at this time credit card on sale etc. etc. Optionally the agent receives a higher score if the call results in a sales transaction. Optionally the agent receives a comparatively lower score if a call does not result in a sales transaction. Optionally the agent s score improves if there are indications of a potential purchase and the score is lowered if there are contrary indications. Optionally the marketing automation platform provides a call center monitoring manager with agent performance status e.g. cumulative totals call score averages call counts per time period etc. . Optionally the marketing automation platform also provides an assessment and or alerts managers of a call s based at least in part on the tone of the customer prospect e.g. soft spoken yelling excited rambling incoherent yelling etc. and or keywords detected during the call e.g. not happy disappointed supervisor manager swear words etc. . Optionally the sales agent s recordings and or transcriptions are reviewed by for example the sales agent s manager.

At a later date for example within 10 days a follow up email is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and sent to the customer prospect. Optionally the follow up email is personalized with respect to certain activity associated with the customer prospect including for examples web site activity a download any internal or external data store mined demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the introductory email was transmitted to the customer prospect any state change in the customer prospects demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the introductory email e.g. birth date credit card purchases credit change announcements social media postings tweets etc. . Optionally the personalized dynamic email is generated from one or more templates and or template paragraphs based at least in part on the detected activity user profile and or state changes. Optionally the personalization is applied to some or all elements of an email including for example sender name subject body text body images signature and or post script. Optionally the follow up email includes a second phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 .

At yet a later date for example within 15 days a personal email is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and sent to the customer prospect where the sender field is configured with a specific sales or call center agent. Optionally the email is personalized as described above. Optionally the personal email includes a third phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 . Optionally inbound calls to the third number or the content of the calls e.g. a fax or recorded message route to a specific sales or call center agent. Optionally for example the call bridging system places the second call to an agent by calling a support center and entering an agent s extension e.g. by generating one or more dtmf tones . Optionally in another example a received fax message is routed to a specific sales or call center agent s .

At yet a later date for example within 30 days an email is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and sent from the sales department in which the email includes for example an item of interest such as a whitepaper of best practices and or a product service discount e.g. included as an attachment . Similar to the 10 day and 15 day emails the communication including the attachment is context aware of and or reflects the customer prospect s state and position within the funnel as described above. Optionally the communication includes a fourth phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 . Optionally inbound calls to the fourth number or the content of the calls e.g. a fax or recorded message route to a specific sales or call center agent.

At yet a later date for example within 45 days a text check in message is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and sent to the customer prospect. Optionally the text communication body includes a fifth phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 . Optionally inbound calls to the fifth number or the content of the calls e.g. a fax or recorded message route to a specific sales or call center agent. Optionally the text communication is sent with the sender address configured with the fifth phone number enabling replies to the text communication to be tracked and recorded. In this latter case optionally the fifth number is not included in the text communication body.

At day 45 as an alternative to or in addition to the text communication a check in call is originated from a sales agent to the customer prospect. Optionally the outbound call routes through the call bridging system so that the call can be processed tracked recorded and data mined as described above e.g. as described with respect to inbound calls in the day 1 case above . For example the system can generate a sixth number presented to the agent which is associated with the customer prospect. Optionally the agent can call a number of the bridging system and enter the phone number of the customer prospect in response to an IVR interface. In another example the system can generate a check in fax call. Optionally calls originated to the customer prospect include as the calling number the sixth phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Thereby any calls returned by the customer prospect to the calling number route through the call processing systems and can be processed tracked and recorded as described above.

At yet a later date for example within 60 days an email communication is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and is sent to the customer prospect regarding a webinar. Similar to the 10 day 15 day and 30 day email the text communication with the customer prospect is context aware as described above. Optionally the email communication includes a seventh phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 . Optionally inbound calls to the seventh number or the content of the calls e.g. a fax or recorded message route to a specific sales or call center agent.

At yet a later date for example within day 75 another text communication or check in call is originated from a sales agent to the customer prospect in which the text communication is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system . Optionally the outbound call and or text communication is processed tracked and recorded as similarly described above with respect to the Day 45 communications. Optionally the text communication includes an eighth phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 . Optionally inbound calls to the eight number or the content of the calls e.g. a fax or recorded message route to a specific sales or call center agent.

At yet a later date for example within day 90 another text communication or call is originated from a sales agent to the customer prospect in which the text communication is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system . Optionally if the products and or services warrant an in person meeting the communication is oriented around scheduling such an in person meeting or a free trial. Optionally the outbound call and or text communication is processed tracked and recorded as described above with respect to the Day 45 communications. Optionally the text communication includes a ninth phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 . Optionally inbound calls to the ninth number or the content of the calls e.g. a fax or recorded message route to a specific sales or call center agent.

Optionally one or more unique numbers e.g. numbers one through nine are assigned to different stages in the customer prospect nurturing campaign as described above. Optionally the same number is used at one or more of the different stages. In the example above customer prospect s communications followed a generalized timeline. Optionally the timeline is accelerated for those leads that exhibit certain behavior e.g. active participation greater than the norm . Optionally A B testing e.g. modifying the order of communications is applied to the nurturing funnel described above. The unique tracking phone numbers facilitate the A B comparison by enabling the monitoring tracking of calls originated by the customer prospects in response to the program.

The example embodiment above illustrates an automated marketing campaign executed by a system using outbound email to generate demand for a product or service. In a similar manner an outbound voice or fax telephony campaign is used to generate product or service demand for those campaign types that enable outbound calling e.g. political and non profit fund raising campaigns . For example the user may create a campaign and configure into the campaign one or more outbound calling campaign lists from a data store of lists. Optionally the user associates one or more calling scripts with the one or more outbound calling campaign lists. The marketing automation system manages e.g. places outbound calls and waits for answer and speech detection before connecting to an agent or before playing a voice prompt or IVR tree form tracks and or records phone based customer interactions throughout the campaign. Optionally campaigns include a combination of textual communications and outbound phone calls as described above with respect to the Day 45 stage.

Optionally an automated marketing campaign using outbound calling follows a multi stage process as similarly described above. For example in the first stage e.g. day 1 an introductory call is placed by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system to a customer prospect. Optionally the marketing automation system places an outbound call for each prospect waits for answer and upon speech being detected bridges connects the call to a waiting live agent. Optionally the marketing automation system places a call to a waiting live agent places a call to a customer prospect and bridges connects the two outbound calls. Optionally the marketing automation system plays a recorded message and or interacts with the prospect via an IVR voice form using dtmf detection or speech recognition controls. Optionally in the example call processing scenario data about the called party the caller the call e.g. a recording of the call and or the call results is stored in one or more data stores e.g. a database . Optionally the call data can be mined and the prospect can be retargeted in this campaign as described below or in subsequent campaigns. For example a recording of the call can be data mined for certain keywords as described above. Optionally outbound calls are all placed with the same caller ID to different customer prospects within the campaign. Optionally outbound calls use different numbers optionally selected from a RingPool which enables the system to uniquely manage return calls even if the caller is calling with a private blocked caller identification.

At a later date for example within 10 days a follow up outbound call is placed by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system to the customer prospect. Optionally the follow up call is personalized with respect to certain activity associated with the customer prospect including for example web site activity a download any internal or external data store mined demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the introductory email was transmitted to the customer prospect any state change in the customer prospects demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the introductory email e.g. birth date credit card purchases credit change announcements social media postings tweets etc. . Optionally the personalized dynamic email is generated from one or more templates and or template paragraphs based at least in part on the detected activity user profile and or state changes. Optionally the personalization is applied to some or all elements of a call script including for example the greeting body text and or call close. Optionally the follow up call is placed using the day 1 campaign phone number e.g. to manage a consistent interaction with prospects who have caller identification features on their telephony device or a second phone number a day 10 phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 .

At yet a later date for example within 15 days a personal call is optionally generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system to the customer prospect where the caller identification field is configured with a specific sales or call center agent phone address and or extension. Optionally if the system detects the call or other outbound calls to customer prospects as defined in this example campaign or other campaigns is answered by an answering machine the system can play a voice announcement which is recorded by the answering machine . Optionally the voice announcement can be configured to play for example dynamic data including the name of a call agent a phone number and or extension for a call agent the name of the customer prospect the phone number of the customer prospect date time information days hours before the expiration of an offer or event eligible discounts web site address campaign manager entered text customer prospect implicit and explicit data e.g. as defined in this specification below scheduling etc. Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 .

At yet a later date for example within 30 days a call is placed by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and bridges connects with the sales department and references an item of interest sent to the prospect such as a whitepaper of best practices and or a product service discount. Similar to the 10 day and 15 day calls the call is context aware of and or reflects the customer prospect s state and position within the funnel as described above. Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 .

At yet a later date for example within day 45 another text communication or call is originated from a sales agent to the customer prospect in which the text or call communication is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system . Optionally if the products and or services warrant an in person meeting the communication is oriented around scheduling such an in person meeting or a free trial. Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 .

A feature of marketing automation is lead or prospect scoring. Lead scoring is a method of assigning a value e.g. a numerical value to leads in order to determine their willingness to purchase a company s product or service. Lead scoring is often used in conjunction with customer prospect nurturing. Leads with high scores can be accelerated through the nurturing funnel or fast tracked to sales and correspondingly leads with low scores can be lead nurtured. In addition lead scoring improves the efficiency of the sales and marketing process by enabling the organization to focus more attention on the higher quality leads.

The method of assigning or calculating a value which may be calculated by the marketing automation system is based at least in part upon a determined collection of attributes associated with the customer prospect. The attributes may include some or all of the following demographic attributes e.g. gender age ethnicity language disabilities mobility homeownership employment status credit status geographic location computing devices mobile devices telephony etc. psychographic attributes e.g. personality traits interests lifestyles values attitudes etc. behavioral attributes e.g. online usage e.g. read emails clicks web visits keywords webinar participation online social media participation etc. loyalty etc. and or organization firm demographics e.g. company size industry job function job title etc. .

Lead prospect scoring may be performed by the marketing automation system or otherwise optionally combining explicit scoring and implicit scoring. Explicit scoring may be based at least in part on information the prospect declares e.g. via an online or faxed registration form and implicit scoring may be based at least in part upon information observed or inferred about the prospect e.g. a link selection on a web page .

With respect to explicit scoring for example a value such as a numerical value is assigned to information declared by the prospect. Optionally one or more internal or external data stores e.g. a data service operated by a separate company are queried to determine additional facts about the prospect based upon their declared data. Optionally the marketing automation supports auto fill forms linked to a user s social media site. Optionally certain declared data is weighted by importance for example a prospects job title can be weighted heavier than his her age.

With respect to implicit scoring for example a value such as a numerical value is assigned to information inferred about the prospect. Optionally one or more external databases are queried to determine additional facts about the prospect based upon the inferred data. Optionally certain inferred data is weighted by importance for example a website selection on a product associated link can be weighted heavier than a website selection on a corporate information associated link.

Optionally the lead s score is determined at least in part by summing the weighted numerical values assigned to the lead across the explicit and implicit attributes. Optionally the lead s score is further modified by adding or subtracting values such as numerical points. For example points might be subtracted from a lead score if some or all of the data is determined to be of low quality relevance based upon for example additional information acquired using a prospect s phone number. If a company is selling year round active wear and it is determined the prospect s phone number is based in California additional points might be added to the lead s score as it is more likely that a California resident will be more interested in such type of clothing due to its moderate weather. In the same example if the prospect s phone number is based in Michigan additional points might be deducted from the lead s score as it is less likely that a Michigan resident will be interested in such type of clothing due to its more extreme weather.

Optionally lead scoring from online interactions is combined with offline interactions and in particular lead scoring associated with telephony call processing. The combined lead scoring provides a deeper and more valuable lead scoring methodology than conventional marketing automation lead scoring. Optionally attributes associated with for example the length of the call and or the disposition of the call are included in the lead s score and or the weighting of the lead s score as further described below. Optionally the placement of calls to designated numbers may route calls directly to an operator e.g. sales and or customer support or calls to such numbers may be configured to terminate in an IVR interface to provide data to and or collect data from a user. Optionally in both lead scoring and lead nurturing information about a customer prospect and or a customer is progressively assembled through a campaign and or previous campaigns and stored e.g. in a data store in association with the customer prospect and or customer e.g. in a lead record . This information is used repeatedly to improve targeting of an existing campaign and or for future campaigns.

In certain embodiments of marketing automation lead scoring there may be hundreds or thousands of possible behavior psychographic demographic and or firmographic attributes that can contribute to a lead score. The following discussion describes example attributes that can be used in telephony service environments although additional fewer or different attributes may be used.

Optionally explicit data can be collected from a customer prospect using a combination of menu selections voice recognition and or voice forms. For example a prospect may be prompted to enter their age using the telephone key pad e.g. press keys corresponding to the customer s age or age range . In another example a prospect may be prompted to audibly state the prospect s years of experience in a particular field or with a particular product or service. In another example the prospect may be prompted to audibly state the prospect s company or employer name. The information audibly provided by the prospect may be recorded by the system and or translated into text using for example an automated voice to text conversion system which may optionally be limited to converting names and number to text and or by a human operator. The system may be further configured to determine additional information about the customer prospect using for example call signaling information including calling party identification. For example one or more internal and or external databases e.g. the Edgar database providing access to SEC filings Dun and Bradstreet database etc. web sites social media sites microblogs etc. can be queried searched to determine additional information about the caller using the phone number of the caller e.g. as a search query term . Optionally the calling party identification or other attributes characteristics of the customer prospect customer can be used to route inbound calls to the appropriate agent e.g. an agent responsible for the customer prospect call sales center etc. If the calling phone number is not recognized by the system or not recognized by the system as owned by a corporate entity the caller may be asked to declare for example via an IVR user interface a work number and or work extension. Optionally in performing lead scoring and lead nurturing portions e.g. 10 seconds of the beginning of the call 10 seconds of the end of the call the entire call etc. of a call interaction with a customer prospect customer may be recorded by the system. Optionally the recorded portions are made available to personnel e.g. marketing personnel for analysis to determine attributes characteristics of the customer prospect customer optionally including attributes not listed below including for example the emotional state reaction of the prospect during the call. Optionally the analysis impacts the prospect s lead score and or nurturing state. Optionally the analysis causes at least in part a one or more marketing programs to be modified. Optionally the call data can be mined for certain keywords and or phrases which indicate a purchase intent by a customer prospect. Optionally a purchase intent reflects a likelihood that the customer prospect will be a customer for a good or service promoted in a marketing campaign program as described above. Optionally if the customer prospect expresses a purchase intent e.g. the customer prospect uses the keywords buy credit card yes I would like to buy . . . bill me etc. the customer prospect s lead score and or nurturing state is enhanced. Enhancing a customer prospect s lead score reflects a corresponding inferred likelihood that the customer prospect or existing customer will purchase a good or service. Similarly if the system does not detect a certain keyword and or phrase which indicates a purchase intent by a customer prospect and or detects a keyword indicating a lack of intent and or a specific intent not to purchase the customer prospect s lead score and or nurturing state is decreased. Decreasing a customer prospect s lead score reflects a corresponding inferred likelihood that the customer prospect or existing customer will not purchase a good or service. Optionally a data store is populated by a provider of the marketing automation system with purchase intent keywords and or phrases . Optionally the speech from the customer prospect is compared by the system against the vocabulary of words in the data store of purchase intent keywords to determine keyword matches. Optionally the data store is populated with new keywords based on data mining experiences of the provider. Optionally the data store is populated and or complemented with new keywords based on the data mining experiences and or market of an operator. Optionally the content of the operator s data store becomes unique proprietary data of the operator. Optionally a prospect s lead score is enhanced by a larger amount e.g. by a factor such as 1.25 depending upon which keyword is detected in the customer prospect s speech. For example the phrase yes I would like to buy . . . increases the lead score more than the phrase I am thinking about purchasing . . . Optionally other attributes of the call are used to factor the lead score increment including the location of the detected keyword in the call session. For example the detection of a purchase intent keyword at the beginning of the call session may not be scored as high as a purchase intent keyword expressed by the customer prospect at or towards the end of the session. Other attributes of the call can also be used to factor a lead score increment. For example the detection of a single keyword and or phrase may not increment the score to the same degree as the detection of multiple keywords and or phrases. In another example keywords can be assigned to groups with certain groups having a higher lead score incremental given a higher indication of a purchase. In another example the intonation pitch and or volume of a keyword can be used as factor in determining the lead score increment. In another example hesitation words e.g. uh and or the length of a pause by the customer prospect s speech in the context of a keyword can be used as a factor in determining the lead score increment. These are only optional examples of attributes of the call that can be used to factor a lead score increment. In another example optionally lead scoring can be decremented if a purchase intent keyword is not detected or a keyword is detected indicating the customer prospect is not going to purchase a good or service. Optionally a data store is populated by a provider and or operator of the marketing automation system with purchase intent lack thereof keywords and or phrases as similarly described above. Optionally analysis of the text is automatically performed in whole or in part via the system.

As discussed above some attributes can result in a negative change in the prospect s score. Optionally a phone number e.g. a RingPool number is changed in response to a user action and or a drop in a lead prospect score. For example a prospect subscribing to a Do Not Text list might have their score lowered and accordingly henceforth only a phone number which is directed to second or third level sales customer support is provided for display to the lower scoring prospect. Other example conditions which may in some embodiments lead to a negative change in a prospect s score and or the assignment and display of the same phone number or a different phone number e.g. a RingPool number include for example a determination of a prospect unsubscribing from an email list or a bounced email visiting press investor and about web pages not visiting the website within a configurable time period changing their purchase timeframe not advancing in the sales funnel subscribing to a Do Not Call list submitting a spam complaint posting a negative social media comment non renewing a contract warranty not residing in a location served by the company a declared title indicating a low likelihood of purchase e.g. student one who doesn t speak English and working in a different industry market. Additional fewer or different conditions may cause the system to reduce the score.

Optionally in certain telephony embodiments one or more optimization engines of one or more types are applied serially or in parallel or some combination thereof during or subsequent to a call to arrive at a collection of scores e.g. micro scores . For example two or more optimization engines may operate in parallel to increase system speed in processing data and generating scores for a given prospect. By way of further example two or more optimization engines may operate in serial to operate as a pipeline to enable different engines to perform different types of calculations for different customer prospects at the same time. In an example telephony embodiment an optimization word engine determines a first micro score by detecting specific keywords phrases spoken by the customer prospect during or subsequent to a call. Optionally the detected keywords phrases are factored with an associated weighting e.g. factoring based upon an inferred likelihood of purchasing a good or service . In the same telephony embodiment optionally a second engine a call detail optimization engine determines a second micro score by analyzing certain call detail attributes associated with the call itself including for example but not limited to is the call a repeat call e.g. as determined by a matching caller phone address in the call signaling information does the caller have an existing customer account e.g. by a query of an account data store time of day of the call call duration location of caller e.g. as determined from an area code of the caller as determined from the call signaling jurisdiction in the call signaling by a query of a wireless location service of the caller etc. In the same telephony embodiment optionally a third engine a caller demographic optimization engine determines a third micro score by accessing certain attributes about the customer prospect including for example but not limited to historic billing or credit history of the caller caller gender caller age etc. Optionally the first micro score the second micro score and third micro score are factored and or summed for an overall score for the call and or customer prospect. Optionally lead scoring call scoring and or customer prospect scoring is applied to an individual campaign across a collection of campaigns associated with a merchant advertiser and or across one or more campaigns associated with a plurality of merchant advertisers. As similarly discussed above if the optimization word engine the call detail optimization engine and the caller demographic optimization engine are configured to operate in parallel optionally the engines can calculate their respective scores for a given customer prospect at the same time. Optionally if the optimization word engine the call detail optimization engine and the caller demographic optimization engine are configured to operate in serial optionally the optimization word engine can calculate a score for a first customer prospect while at about the same time the call detail optimization engine is calculating a score for a second customer prospect while at about the same time as the caller demographic optimization engine is calculating a score for a third customer prospect providing a fast and efficient engine pipeline for calculating scores.

Thus certain embodiments may be utilized to determine and or combine explicit and implicit scoring for a customer prospect for a good or service. Optionally an identifier such as a phone address and or a persistent unique identifier is associated with the customer prospect.

Thus certain embodiments may be utilized with a variety of campaigns that integrate telephone and online aspects. Optionally in certain embodiments if a call to a marketing campaign phone address published via an online channel is identified as a spam or suspected spam call the associated online promotion will not receive credit for the call.

Lead prospect scoring may be performed by the marketing automation system or otherwise optionally combining explicit scoring and implicit scoring. Explicit scoring may be based at least in part on information the prospect declares e.g. affirmatively provides via an application or online or faxed registration form and implicit scoring may be based at least in part upon information observed or inferred about the prospect e.g. a link selection on a web page 

Generally unique promotional telephone numbers or other types of unique contact addresses may be used to track performance of a campaign across multiple media outlets. By utilizing unique phone numbers or other contact addresses e.g. for the period during which the campaign is being conducted the PM system tracks the potential customer s experience from the initial advertisement to conversion specific to a designated media outlet . For online offline and or mobile advertisements a deeper level of tracking is available. By associating custom tracking parameter values that distinguish the attributes of the traffic source to the call itself the user can then easily determine tracking granularity down to the individual advertisement level. This method of online offline and or mobile tracking can be applied to for example search engine marketing or any online ad placements.

In many cases a sale is attributable to one or a number of marketing touch points where a prospect encounters the marketing campaign or where the prospect and company engage to exchange information provide service or handle transactions including for example the touch points described above such as telephony touch points. Optionally the marketing automation system allocates attributes a sale across some or all those marketing elements touch points the prospect interacted with during the course of a marketing program campaign. This attribution improves Return On Investment calculations and provides a clearer view into the actual sales process.

As described above the association of phone numbers with media elements enables marketing personnel and other personnel including the management team to attribute offline sales transactions and or telephony sales transactions with certain media elements e.g. including online media elements . This association enables marketing personnel to assess the performance of their marketing campaign. Optionally those marketing campaigns programs with higher registered cumulative online and or offline sales can be analyzed and metrics generated e.g. cost per acquisition to enable an efficient marketing spend of limited marketing budgets.

Optionally a condition which registers and or attributes the sale of a good or service is the detection by the system of a spoken purchase intent keyword and or a definitive purchase intent keyword. An example of a definitive purchase intent keyword includes the spoken credit card information of the customer.

As described herein in certain embodiments determining the quality of the call can be ascertained by analyzing the call audio for certain keywords phrases and or combination of keywords which may collectively be referred to herein as keywords unless the context indicates otherwise . In the descriptive examples of keyword call quality analysis herein detected keywords are used for example to change a lead score or automatically attribute a sale. However call quality analysis can be used in a number of call quality determinations optionally including but not limited to one or more of the following customer prospect lead generation sales conversions agent operator call interaction optimization agent operator call script optimization and fraud identification. Optionally the lack of or absence of detected keywords phrases in calls can similarly be used to determine the quality of calls.

As described herein in certain embodiments system users and or operators define keywords and or phrases to be used in call quality analysis. Optionally the system provides a user interface for example a web user interface via which the users and or operators can access the system over for example a data network to specify or configure which keywords and or phrases are to be used in a one or more call quality analysis. Optionally an application is provided for example via a download over a data network to a user and or operator which for example runs on a mobile device of the user e.g. a mobile phone tablet computer laptop etc. and provides the user interface enabling the user to specify the call quality keywords and or phrases. Optionally a user configures via the user interface the call quality for a set of calls by specifying a keyword or phrase which may then be received and stored by the system. Optionally the user interface presents one or more keywords and or phrases for the user to choose from. Optionally the system selects and presents via the user interface one or more keywords and or phrases for the user to choose from based upon a user selection of a type of call and or call quality where a call type might be for example selected based on sales conversion keywords and or phrases.

Optionally the user interface enables a user to specify a combination of keywords and or phrases using Boolean operators such as OR AND ANDNOT EXLUSIVE OR etc. For example a user or operator might enter the expression tickets ANDNOT hockey AND basketball where the system triggers on the detected word tickets but only if the keywords hockey and basketball are not also detected. Optionally the user interface also supports the use of a wildcard symbol a character that may be substituted for any of a defined subset of all possible characters or character strings . The detection of any keyword and or phrase that contains that portion of the specified keyword creates a trigger. For example the trigger entry ticket would create a call quality trigger for the audio keywords ticket or tickets. Optionally keyword and or phrase combinations are specified on a campaign user account advertiser or system wide basis or other customer prospect partitioning aspect. As described herein the user interface provides a mechanism to monitor call quality including the option to review transcription and or listen to active or recorded calls. Optionally the user interface enables a user operator to edit and or temporarily or permanently disable a specified call quality.

As described herein in certain embodiments the system optionally data mines analyzes the audio and or text transcription of the audio of the customer prospect caller for inbound calls and called party for outbound calls . Optionally the analysis takes place in whole or in part during the call in substantially real time and or after the call completes. Optionally the user operator specifies keywords and or phrase combinations or does not specify keywords and or phrase combinations. Optionally in either case the system determines from the audio transcription the number of long and short phrases spoken by a customer prospect e.g. where a user may specify a first threshold number of words under which or equal to the phrase is characterized as a short phrase and the user may specify a second threshold number of words over which the phrase is characterized as a long phrase where the first and second threshold may be the same threshold . Optionally the system counts the number of long and or short phrases spoken by a customer prospect. Optionally the system counts the number of long and or short phrases that are repeated by a customer prospect. Optionally the system counts the number of words used by a customer prospect in a call. Optionally the system counts the number of words repeated in the audio of the call. Optionally the system only counts the number of times a keyword and or phrase is repeated in the call. The system provides to users operators the call counts during and or subsequent to the call via a user interface or via reports. Optionally some or all of the foregoing counts e.g. individually in the weighted aggregate or otherwise are used by the system to determine in whole or in part the quality of a call.

Thus certain embodiments may be utilized with call monitoring campaigns to enable a user operator to define what constitutes a quality call.

In addition to A B media testing A B call scripting may be used in call centers. In an example embodiment of A B call scripting two or more different call scripts may be used to guide agents through a call session with a customer and or customer prospect where the agents may read the script to the customer and or customer prospect e.g. word for word or by paraphrasing the script . In an example embodiment the call processing marketing automation platform allocates a configurable specified percentage of calls e.g. wherein the calls are inbound or outbound to agents using different call scripts and tracks and reports via a user interface the success and failure rates of the different scripting to management to enable management to select which script should be used in future and or to determine how a given script is to be modified to provide enhanced customer service and prospect conversion.

In an example embodiment of A B call scripting a first call script is presented for reading via a user interface of the call processing marketing automation platform to a first agent in association with a first inbound call from a first customer customer prospect. The results of first call session and the information collected and or derived about the call and or the first customer customer prospect are stored in association with a first customer and or customer prospect account record and or call session identifier. In the same example a second call script different from the first call script is presented for reading via the user interface of the call processing marketing automation platform to the first agent in association with a second inbound call from a second customer customer prospect. The second call session results and the information collected and or derived about the second call and or second customer customer prospect are stored in association with a second customer and or customer prospect account and or call session identifier. The example embodiment continues with the marketing automation system alternating the script for example between the first call script and the second call script with each inbound call directed to an agent. In this example A B testing embodiment advantageously the agent is constant to reduce the number of variables and the scripting is varied across calls. Thus differences in results e.g. conversions or closed customer service inquiries may be attributed at least partly to the differences in the script rather than the script delivery by different agents. Optionally the marketing automation system compiles the varying script results across multiple agents.

Optionally an active user interface e.g. where the marketing automation system continually updates call results for display by the user interface displays to one or more agent managers or marketing managers a system generated comparison of the sales and or service performance of the scripts in play. Optionally the one or more agent managers or marketing managers are presented with user interface controls enabling them to instruct the system to change the frequency of the first script presentation versus the second script presentation where the second script may be a plurality of scripts .

Optionally the marketing automation platform automatically determines the weighting of which call script is to be used by agents based upon a set of configurable specified criteria such as for example the number and or percentage of successful sales or closed customer service inquiries. Optionally a specified number of calls are processed before the call weighting is manually or automatically adjusted. Optionally the stored call information may be mined analyzed to determine if there are other attributes e.g. location of caller time of day day of week area code whether call is from a wireless mobile phone or a landline whether the call is from a place of business or a residence detected gender of caller whether the call is a video call or voice call etc. associated with the calls which improve the performance of the first script or the second script. For example it may be determined that the first script consistently outperforms the second script except when the caller is located in a particular region of the country. In an example embodiment the call processing marketing automation platform may be configured to use a specific agent call script based at least in part on one or more implicit and explicit attributes associated with the call and or caller e.g. wherein the implicit and explicit attributes or the call and or caller are further described herein . As in the previous example the system may provide for display on a terminal of the agent the second call script when the caller is located in a particular region of the country e.g. wherein the specified attribute in such case is the caller s location and the first script in all other calls when the caller is determined to be located outside the particular region of the country.

In another example embodiment of A B call scripting a first call script is presented via a user interface of the call processing marketing automation platform to a first agent for reading in association with a first inbound call. The first call session results and the information collected and or derived from the call and or caller are stored in association with a customer and or customer prospect account and or call session identifier. In the same example a second call script different from the first call script is presented via the user interface of the call processing marketing automation platform to a second agent for reading in association with a second inbound call. The second call session results and the information collected and or derived from the call and or caller are stored in association with a customer and or customer prospect account or call session identifier. The example embodiment continues with the script alternating with each inbound call across various agents. Optionally the system compiles the varying script results across multiple agents and generates and presents a comparison of the script results for management s review. Optionally the manual user interface controls and automatic controls as similarly described above may be used to adjust the frequency of a particular script display on a terminal of an agent. Further as similarly described herein data mining and analysis may be performed by the system to determine correlations between call attributes scripts and call session outcomes.

The number of calls originating to and received from mobile devices is increasing dramatically. In many cases the mobile device includes a video display option and increasingly the percentage of calls include all or a portion of video. Optionally customer s and customer prospect s call session data collection described herein with respect to audio calls may be applied to video based calls as well. A video call experience enables the call processing and marketing automation platform to collect additional information attributes about the call and or caller relative to an audio only session and to use the display medium to enhance the customer prospect call experience. The additional information and or enhanced customer experience may improve sales conversion rates and to reduce the time to close service calls thus lowering costs . Optionally the hardware and software to support a video call is available on or provided by the mobile device of the customer or customer prospect. Optionally the call processing and marketing automation platform provides a portion of the video display software on the customer s and or customer prospect s device e.g. via an app or via a webpage .

Optionally the call processing and marketing automation platform provides a video capable application on the mobile device of the customer and or customer prospect. Optionally a portion of the software or the application is downloaded over a data network such as the Internet to the device of the customer customer prospect. Optionally call signaling may be used at least in part to determine if a caller is calling from a mobile device e.g. wherein a calling phone address from the caller identification field is used as a parameter in a data store query . Optionally the system may infer and or determine from one or more data store queries that if the caller is calling from a mobile device that the device may be capable of a video display.

Optionally a phone address called by the customer prospect determines if the caller is calling from their mobile device e.g. if an assigned ring pool number is used in association with an online session . Optionally other methods of determining if the caller is calling from a mobile device or is being called on a mobile device such as the customer customer prospect declaring that the user is using a mobile device via a selection of a user interface control in a mobile device application or a web page. Optionally a call session may be initiated via a messaging session e.g. iMessage session chat session instant messaging session etc. and later be upgraded to an audio and or video call session where it is understood that a video call session may include an audio component .

In an example embodiment the display medium in a video call may be used by the call processing and marketing automation platform to display an image of merchandise offered to the customer prospect including but not limited to one or more of the following examples optional colors accessories various models various manufacturers etc. Optionally the display medium can be used to illustrate the operation or assembly of an item including the display of an item in a separate window within the overall display medium. Optionally the display medium can be used to cause the user device to display a form provided by the call processing and marketing automation platform in which the customer customer prospect can provide entries for one or more form fields e.g. by speaking selecting or otherwise filling in a one or more fields .

As previously described herein certain detected keywords and voice inflections are used by the call processing and marketing automation platform to assist the agent in completing a call session. In an example embodiment in a video call the call processing and marketing automation platform optionally uses facial recognition technologies alone or in combination with the audio stream to make certain determinations about the call and customer customer prospect and optionally record log the determinations and or data from the call. Optionally the determinations are used to modify the agent s behavior such as by providing for display on the terminal of the agent a call progress indicator and or changing the scripting for the agent s use in the call. For example a detected positive customer customer prospect countenance might cause the call processing and marketing automation platform to display on a terminal of the agent a green or other positive call progress indicator and a close sale script.

Optionally facial recognition technologies are used to assist in the verification of the identity of the calling party called to the agent. Optionally an image of the customer customer prospect s face is stored in the marketing automation platform and the image of the customer prospect s face in the current call session is compared against stored images to identify the customer customer prospect e.g. by identifying and comparing facial features such as the relative orientation position size and or shape of the eyes nose cheekbones forehead and jaw and using for example a template matching system or other facial recognition system . Optionally an external data store may be used at least in part to assist in the identification and authentication of the customer customer prospect. Optionally a record from the identified customer customer prospect may be accessed and information from the record e.g. name age gender location purchase history etc. may be presented to the agent. Optionally the determined identity of the calling or called party may be used at least in part by the agent to personalize the call experience e.g. by enabling the agent to ask the caller if they can call the customer prospect by their first name which may already be known by the agent from the record accessed as a result of the comparison .

In an example embodiment if it is determined the customer and or customer prospect is calling from a mobile device or the system is calling a customer s and or customer prospect s mobile device in response to a triggering event e.g. an agent selecting a user interface control the call processing and marketing automation platform initiates a download of an application or marketing collateral material to the customer s and or customer prospect s mobile device. Optionally the download is transferred over the call connection network e.g. using SIP T . Optionally the download occurs over a data network connection associated with the customer and or customer prospect s online session as determined by the system for example by a click to call from a web session wherein a Ring Pool number is the called number .

As previously described herein the call processing and marketing automation platform may monitor the audio channel for background speech and noise. In an example embodiment the call processing and marketing automation platform may similarly monitor images in a video call using an image analysis system. Optionally image processing technologies and techniques are used to determine information about the surroundings background of the caller called party . Optionally the call processing and marketing automation platform uses image processing technologies alone or in combination with the audio stream e.g. wherein the detected keywords and facial expressions detected keywords and environment e.g. wherein the environment is a shopping mall to make certain determinations about the call and customer customer prospect and optionally record log the determinations and or data from the call. Optionally the determinations are used to select and provide the agent with information and or scripts so as to modify the agent s behavior.

Optionally the images are processed to for example determine the caller s surroundings. For example if the caller appears to be placing the call from inside their home the agent may be provided with a script which enables a slightly longer sales process e.g. the script is longer in length or asks the caller for relatively more information . In the same example the call processing and marketing automation platform may generate one or more queries based upon data associated with the images such as for example a determination of the physical location from which the caller is placing the call e.g. for authentication reasons . In a similar example the call processing and marketing automation platform may determine from the background images that the caller is in a business district or shopping mall. Optionally the call processing and marketing automation platform provides the agent with a restaurant recommendation near the determined caller s location. Optionally the call processing and marketing automation platform uses background image information e.g. wherein background image information is a sign post unique building etc. to determine the location of the caller or called party if the caller location is undeterminable by other means. Optionally the video session and determined information associated with the video call is logged stored in association with the customer customer prospect. Optionally the stored image data is data mined analyzed to enhance the results of future call sessions.

As previously described herein the call processing platform and or marketing automation platform with integrated telephony is optionally operated and managed by a provider separate from the advertiser or the merchant of the goods and or services. Further customer and or customer prospect calls and or leads may be generated by online offline publishers e.g. affiliates which are not directly associated with the merchants. These lead generators are paid credited for the calls they deliver. As described in detail herein the quantity of leads and the quality of the call e.g. wherein the quality of the call is defined by certain implicit and explicit call and or caller attributes as described herein may be purchased from independent telephony providers on a fixed amount or varying amount. In some cases the calls are paid on whether a sale can be attributed to the call. An innovative auction market exchange is described where merchants can bid on call leads prior to or during a call.

In an example embodiment an interface e.g. a user interface for display or a data interface configured to interface with a bidding system is provided e.g. over a data network such as the Internet for display on potential bidder terminals via the call processing and or integrated telephony marketing automation platform in which merchants and or advertisers can place bids e.g. wherein a bid is a contractual commitment to pay a monetary dollar amount on prospective calls from customer or customer prospects in a private auction format. The bids may be placed manually or by an automated bidding system. Optionally prospective calls or call leads are categorized by one or more call and or caller attributes by an operator of the call processing and or integrated telephony marketing automation platform e.g. by an operator via a user interface where the system stores the settings in memory .

For example a California merchant may bid on calls generated within a category of location e.g. only the State of California and optionally associated with other criteria e.g. only calls from mobile phones only voice calls only video calls only calls from specific area codes other call or caller characteristics discussed herein etc. . Optionally the call and or caller attributes used for categorizing calls include for example received call signaling data associated with the call the caller s online web or application interactions prior to or during the call e.g. wherein the web page or application is determined via a Ring Pool number placed in association with the web page or application a call session interaction e.g. wherein the interaction is the caller s response to an IVR prompt a detected call monitoring event one or more internal or external data store queries as described herein etc. The system receives via the interface from the advertisers and merchants participating in the private auction the maximum monetary amount they are willing to pay for a given call. The private auction plays out in an automated manner e.g. as discussed below each time a call is received or originated if the telephony provider is placing for example outbound telemarketing calls .

Optionally the system compares certain or each call and or caller attributes associated with pending bids to the received and or determined attributes of the call and or caller. Optionally based at least in part on the comparison the system directs calls e.g. wherein the call directing is a call transfer call forward or call bridge action to the winning bidder. Optionally a call which exactly matches a set of one or more specified attributes is directed to the highest bid. In the case in which an exact match is not made or the specified attributes cannot be determined from the received and or determined attributes the call is optionally directed to the advertiser and or merchant based on other relevant factors which may include one or more of the following the number of attribute matches a weighting of a one or more matched attribute a relevance and or similarity of an attribute to an attribute specified in a bid e.g. the state of Arizona may be considered relevant to a specified state of California location attribute as residents of Arizona regularly travel to California or a detected keyword or phrase that is similar but not an exact match to a specified bid attribute keyword or phrase a default bid for calls in which there are no attribute matches etc. Optionally the call processing and or integrated telephony marketing automation platform provides a reporting interface available to merchants and or advertisers e.g. for display or for consumption by an automated bidding system enabling the bidders to monitor their call performance. Optionally the interface provides a set of controls that enable bidders to adjust their bids to enhance their call performance e.g. via an automated bidding system or manually .

Optionally the system data mines analyzes the call performance associated with the set of bidders and provides certain recommendations to the bidders which may increase their call performance including one or more of the following call and or call attribute changes bid pricing changes up or down call experience modifications e.g. introduce or remove an IVR etc. Optionally the underlying call and or caller data used to produce the system s reports for a merchant advertiser may be made available to the merchant advertiser over a data network such as the Internet. Optionally the merchant advertiser processes the data to make their own determinations on how they may change their pending and or future bids. Optionally the data is transferred to the merchant advertiser on a per call basis or periodically on a batch basis e.g. including recommendations and or data regarding bids for multiple calls using telephony and or data network techniques described herein.

In an example embodiment the call processing and or integrated telephony marketing automation platform receives an inbound call. The system optionally receives explicit call and or caller attributes associated with the call via the call signaling. Optionally the system queries one or more internal or external data stores to collect additional implicit and explicit information attributes regarding the call and or caller as previously described herein. Optionally the system compares certain or each call and or caller attributed associated with pending bids to the received and or determined attributes of the call and or caller. Optionally based at least in part on the comparison the system directs e.g. wherein the call directing is a call transfer call forward or call bridge action calls to the matching highest bidder of the calls e.g. wherein the highest bidder within a category where the attributes of the call are similar to or match the category attributes .

In an example embodiment the merchant and or advertiser provides customer identifying information e.g. wherein the identifying information is a list of phone addresses to the independent telephony provider. Optionally the call processing and marketing automation platform compares one or more call and or caller attributes to the customer identifying information. Optionally if there is a match in the comparison the call is directed to a call center of the merchant per instructions provided by the merchant e.g. where the instructions are provided via a user interface over a data network . Advantageously the merchant may avoid the loss of their customer to a competitor. Optionally the merchant and or advertiser agrees to match or exceed the highest bid for the matching calls.

Optionally activity on one or more social media sites is monitored by a social media monitoring system to detect company related interactions. These monitored interactions optionally cause the system to generate an alert to sales customer support when the system determines that an action should be taken. For example a prospect might tweet or place a post on a Facebook Fan Page that s he is looking for reviews on a product or service offered by the company. This may be detected by or on behalf of the marketing system e.g. by the social media monitoring system . Optionally based at least in part on such detection of the prospect interaction with a social media platform the marketing system increases the lead score associated with the prospect. Optionally an outbound call is manually or automatically originated from a sales group optionally with a modified calling party ID as discussed above to the prospect and or one or a series of textual communications are sent to the prospect that include one or more unique phone numbers e.g. RingPool numbers as discussed above to help advance trigger a sale. Similarly a detected negative social media interaction by a prospect may cause the social media monitoring system to decrease the lead score associated with the prospect and or any networked members of the prospect. Optionally a manually or automatically outbound call is originated from a sales group optionally with a modified calling party ID as discussed above to the prospect and or one or a series of fax or textual communications are sent to the prospect that include unique phone numbers e.g. RingPool numbers as discussed above intended to or configured to address the concern negative issue. Optionally the social media monitoring system s is a part of the marketing automation system platform or is integrated for example via a data network connection.

In addition with respect to scoring and tracking optionally the amount of social media activity associated with a prospect can be a heavily weighted factor in determining a prospect s lead score. For example a prospect with a large number of friends may be an early adopter influencer. Consequently the prospect may be treated as a VIP and provided with special enhanced treatment and privileges such as for example a free trial of the product and or service and a hotline phone number that may bypass an IVR system.

As described above there are many elements that may be associated with a marketing program which creates marketing touches customer interactions which may lead to a sale. Historically when marketing campaigns included an online element the customer prospect interacted with these elements from a fixed computing environment e.g. a work or a home personal computer . With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets it would be advantageous for at least some customer interactions to take place via a prospect s mobile computing device. Optionally the marketing automation system accounts for the mobile device environment by modifying the display to accommodate smaller screen displays and or by supporting first party cookies to support tracking on mobile devices such as the iPhone. Optionally lead nurturing and lead scoring take into account that the interaction is occurring on a mobile device and may change the weighting and scoring. For example if all interactions with the prospect have been via a mobile device and the prospect switches to a fixed device the prospect s lead score may be increased and or interaction with the prospect may be routed to a sale group. Use of a mobile device may afford new and different inference opportunities. For example dynamic location data of the mobile device if available may be used by the marketing automation system to determine how to modify lead scoring and routing. For example if the marketing automation system determines a prospect is accessing a white paper or presentation from his her company location the prospect s lead score may be increased and the white paper presentation may include a VIP phone number e.g. which may bypass an IVR system or otherwise provide preferred access to support personnel .

In support of mobile devices many of the large eCommerce merchants provide to their customers and prospective customers a mobile application. Merchant mobile applications reinforce a merchant s brand and reduce the friction associated with purchases. In an example embodiment the Marketing Automation Platform MAP provides a set of tools which can be used to create configure customized apps for mobile devices including for example iPhone iPad iTouch iOS platforms Android platforms etc.

In an example embodiment the marketing automation platform provides a set of a tools which the MAP customer utilizes to create apps. For example the MAP customer downloads an apps configurator. The MAP customer customizes their application using the downloaded apps configurator. Optionally the configurator supports feature customization including for example some or all of the following customizing the skin of the app colors matte etc. integrating the merchant company s logo customizing the app icon which is displayed on the user s screen customizing the app loading splash screen customizing a small logo that is displayed on all or a selected set of app screens customization of a banner image displayed when the app is launched customization of the copyright logo displayed on a copyright page customization of a background image page s displayed on one or more app pages e.g. a store view page creating customizing a store view of offered products and or services with or without images creating customizing optional thumbnail views of offered products and or services dynamic RingPool number assignments for sales and or general customer support for apps accessing the dialing capabilities of the phone Call Chat Text buttons e.g. in which the app directly interfaces with the phone dialer or connects via an IP data connection for example a VoIP connection short and long app description pages etc. Optionally the app once configured by the MAP customer is submitted for example by the MAP provider to an online store including for example iTunes or Android stores.

The marketing automation system may measure the effectiveness of marketing programs using a set of metrics. For example a company with one or more email programs may measure the effectiveness of the programs using a set of email metrics including for examples the unsubscribe rate bounce rate open rate and click through rate. Telephony metrics can be measured. For example the effectiveness of the telephony marketing program may be based at least in part on one or more of the following the number of callers added to the Do Not Disturb and Do Not Text list e.g. where the relatively higher the number the less effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be and the relatively lower the number the relatively more effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be number of dropped calls inbound or outbound after answer e.g. where the relatively higher the number the less effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be and the relatively lower the number the relatively more effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be number of dropped calls inbound or outbound after salutation welcome e.g. where the relatively higher the number the less effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be and the relatively lower the number the relatively more effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be call durations e.g. where the relatively shorted the call the less effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be and the relatively longer the call or number of fax pages received the relatively more effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be call inbound or outbound closure rates tele qualification success rates e.g. where the relatively higher the rate the more effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be and the relatively lower the rate the relatively less effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be invalid phone number rates e.g. where the relatively lower the rate the more effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be and the relatively higher the rate the relatively less effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be busy no fax tone detected or no answer call rates e.g. where the relatively lower the rate the more effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be and the relatively higher the rate the relatively less effective the telephony marketing program is determined to be etc.

The term marketing campaign is intended to encompass generally sales campaigns where a product or service is on sale and or sold to a customer prospect wherein the terms sale or sold include offered for license and licensed respectively . For example a marketing campaign may include the management of service and support interactions with a firm in a cohesive and integrated manner using the techniques described above. In addition a marketing campaign may include the management of product returns and return authorization in association with a merchant using some or all of the techniques described herein and including for example defining the set of items which are returnable enabling partial order returns enabling individual item returns determining and or selecting shipping methods. While the term marketing campaign may be used herein with respect to certain embodiments for illustrative purposes other types of campaigns may be used as well.

In an example embodiment lead nurturing with integrated telephony as similarly described above is applicable to inbound interactions with existing customers. For example a series of actions may occur at least partly in response to triggering events and or time period transitions. Optionally a customer exits the particular nurturing and problem resolution campaign once the customer s problem has been resolved or other condition occurs e.g. problem not found customer purchases an upgraded product or service customer purchases an extended service plan etc. .

In an example embodiment in a first stage e.g. day 1 of a service campaign a customer sends in an email describing a problem and product identification information. Optionally a case number is assigned. Optionally the response email is personalized with respect to certain detected activities associated with the customer including for examples one or more of the following problem resolution suggestions web site activity a download any internal or external data store mined demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the first email was received any state change in the customer prospects demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the first email was received the customer became a prospect or the customer prospect became a customer e.g. birth date credit card purchases credit change announcements social media postings tweets etc. . Optionally the personalized dynamic email is generated by the system from one or more templates and or template paragraphs based at least in part on the reported problem and or detected activity user profile and or state changes. Optionally the personalization is applied to some or all elements of an email including for example sender name subject body text body images signature and or post script. Optionally the response email includes a first phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls originated to the first phone number transition through a call bridging system which places a second call to a support center by way of example. Optionally the calls terminate on a call processing switching center or fax server directly within the support organization. Optionally in either example call processing scenario data about the caller the call and or the call results are stored in one or more data stores e.g. a database . Optionally some or all information gathered from the user in a user email or a web form filled in the by the user is stored in association with the user account.

At a later date for example within 3 days or other time period a follow up email is generated by the marketing automation system or a system integrated with the marketing automation system and sent to the customer if a call has not been received from the customer and or a determination is made that the problem has not been resolved. Optionally the follow up email is personalized with respect to certain activities associated with the customer prospect including for example one or more of the following problem resolution suggestions web site activity a download any internal or external data store mined demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the first customer email was received the customer became a prospect or the customer prospect became a customer any state change in the customer prospects demographic psychographic personal data etc. since the first email was received the customer became a prospect or the customer prospect became a customer e.g. birth date credit card purchases credit change announcements social media postings tweets etc. . Optionally the personalized dynamic email is generated from one or more templates and or template paragraphs based at least in part on the reported problem and or detected activity user profile and or state changes. Optionally the personalization is applied to some or all elements of an email including for example sender name subject body text body images signature and or post script. Optionally the follow up email includes a second phone number optionally selected from a RingPool . Optionally calls are processed tracked and data mined as described above with respect to the first stage day 1 .

Optionally the service campaign traverses states similar to those described above with respect to the email demand generation campaign. Optionally a customer does not exit the service campaign until a one or more conditions have been satisfied optionally including for example problem resolved no problem found customer sale e.g. upgrade purchase extended warranty parts shipped etc. . Optionally the marketing automation platform pays out a credit and or compensation e.g. if the service team is commissioned for sales if the service team is an outsourced organization etc. depending upon a transaction during the campaign e.g. a sale and or the exit from the campaign.

Some purchases are often made by an individual or group of individuals. These accounts may require special attention and or extraordinary service. In an example embodiment the marketing automation system enables the assignment of unique phone numbers e.g. VIP phone numbers to each small group account and or individual or a subset thereof. Advantageously the marketing automation platform manages routes calls tracks and reports status as described above on these small group accounts or VIP group campaigns. Optionally special enhanced call treatment and routing rules can be applied to VIP group campaigns. Optionally calls to a VIP group assigned RingPool number route to a specific customer account representative e.g. assigned to handle VIP customers . Optionally automatic call escalation rules are in place if the customer account representative is unavailable. For example in a very high mileage flier account calls to a uniquely assigned phone number route directly to a personal representative familiar with and assigned to the flier. If the personal representative is away from the office the marketing automation platform may route incoming calls to a backup number e.g. the personal representative s mobile number . If the personal representative does not answer the incoming call e.g. within 4 rings or a specified period of time the call is further routed by the marketing automation platform to the personal representative s manager. Advantageously as described herein the marketing automation platform can optionally be used in various marketing scenarios including individuals or small groups with the same feature richness and call routing capabilities as large account campaigns.

Certain conventional systems provide means for advertisers and Web analytic companies to automatically download tracking software and data to a user s browser including for example cookies tracking pixels and other similar software technologies when the user visits their websites. This software tracking technology enables an advertiser to select and display advertisements and promotions on web pages of Web sites the user later views. Because this tracking technology had been represented by certain users and media as being an intrusion on users privacy conventional browser technology has evolved to incorporate new features and capabilities to better protect Web user s privacy. For example some browsers do not accept third party cookies and others have configurable settings e.g. a Do Not Track default setting which disable tracking altogether. The foregoing privacy features and capabilities are creating challenges for advertisers in their efforts to improve the targeting of their advertising expenditures.

Another challenge Advertisers are facing is the increasing number of computing devices associated with a given user mobile devices in particular. Conventionally there are limited means available to advertisers to track consumer s usage across their user devices including but not limited to their laptop desktop smartphone tablet set top box networked automotive infotainment system game console wearable device etc. Thus for example if a user performs a preliminary search on their tablet computer followed by a more detailed investigation on their laptop and then performs a contact us search and places a call on their smartphone using a phone address located via the contact search conventionally there are limited techniques available to track the user across multiple user devices and to cross promote a product or service across these user devices.

Optionally the conventional tracking technologies e.g. Web cookies described above may be replaced or complemented with a persistent unique identifier provided via a persistent unique identifier platform. Optionally the persistent unique identifier utilizes first party identifiers gained through explicit user credentials. For example the login by a user into their Web mail account or social networking web page is a type of first party identification where the Web provider knows who the user is as a result of their logging in to the Web provider s site or other services e.g. by logging into the user s account . Thus the Web provider can track the user across the multiple devices e.g. phone tablet computer desktop computer interactive television etc. via which the user logs into their account. Optionally the persistent unique identifier is created at least in part from implicit user data such as third party Web cookies which meet certain minimum quality reliability thresholds. Optionally one or more Websites e.g. search service Web sites social networking Web sites microblog Websites or Web service providers wherein Websites and Web service providers are sometimes collectively referred to as Web service providers unless the context indicates otherwise collect for a given unique identifier detailed impression data e.g. for ad impressions optionally including for example one or more of an impression timestamp a browser header an IP address etc. as the user accesses and navigates a network such as the Internet. Optionally the persistent unique identifier is used by a given Web service provider in promotions e.g. in tracking users to determine which promotions and associated advertisements are to be provided to which users and on which device of the user and or made available to partners of the Web service provider e.g. advertising partners . Optionally the persistent unique identifier is provided to partners via a secondary identifier wherein the partner receiving the second identifier cannot determine the persistent unique identifier and so cannot determine the user s actual identity in order to obfuscate the user s identity from the partner. Optionally the secondary identifier is a plurality of identifiers wherein unique secondary identifiers may be generated and provided to respective partners wherein each partner optionally receives a different secondary identifier in order to preclude sharing of the secondary identifier amongst partners. By way of example the provider of the second identifier may optionally have an internal mapping of a given unique identifier to one or more corresponding secondary identifiers.

Optionally persistent unique identifiers are used in the context of downloadable or pre installed applications. As similarly described above a persistent unique identifier may optionally be created via first party identifiers gained through explicit user credentials entered by the user. In an example of first party identifier the user customer prospect downloads and registers e.g. by providing a user name email address and password an application on one or more of the user customer prospect s computing devices. Thus for example an entire household or a subset thereof may optionally be treated as a customer prospect. Optionally a user s credentials are shared across multiple members in a user s household. For example a couple may use the same login and password to access a merchant account. Optionally multiple members in a user s household optionally share multiple devices. Thus the back end network based platform of the application provider can track a user s and or members of a household or users which share devices and or account credentials and record activity across the user s multiple devices e.g. phone tablet computer desktop computer interactive television etc. on which instantiations of the application is installed where different devices may optionally have different versions of the application installed .

Optionally a persistent unique identifier or customer prospect identifier is created at least in part from implicit user data such as third party Web cookies which meet certain minimum quality reliability thresholds. Optionally one or more application providers collect for a given unique identifier detailed impression data e.g. for ad impressions optionally including for example one or more of an impression timestamp an IP address application activation and access events etc. as the user customer prospect accesses their installed application across one or more of their devices wherein the application provides via a wired and or wireless network e.g. the Internet online status impression application data and event data to the back end platform of the application provider. Optionally persistent unique identifiers are used by a given application provider in promotions e.g. in tracking users to determine which promotions and associated advertisements are to be provided to which users and on which device of the user and or made available to partners of the application provider e.g. advertising partners .

Optionally to protect a given user s privacy the persistent unique identifier is provided to partners via a secondary identifier wherein the partner receiving the second identifier cannot determine the persistent unique identifier and so cannot determine the user s actual identity in order to obfuscate the user s identity from the partner. Optionally the secondary identifier comprises a plurality of identifiers wherein unique secondary identifiers may be generated and provided to respective partners wherein each partner optionally receives a different secondary identifier in order to preclude sharing of the secondary identifier amongst partners. By way of example the provider of the second identifier may optionally have an internal mapping of a given unique identifier to one or more corresponding secondary identifiers.

Optionally the user s phone address is stored by the Web provider and or the marketing automation system in association with the persistent unique identifier created by the Web provider or a partner . Optionally the user s phone address is received from the user where the user explicitly provides the phone address via a phone address collection field presented by a user interface. Optionally the user s phone address is determined by accessing one or more data stores associated with first party identifying accounts where at least one data store stores the user s phone address. Optionally Web cookie equivalent data can be retrieved from a data store by a Web provider or Web provider partner using the phone address of the user as a query parameter to search for and locate the corresponding Web cookie equivalent data.

In the above example embodiment a calling phone address of a customer prospect is stored in association with a persistent unique identifier. Optionally in addition or instead unique advertisement impression phone addresses including for example RingPool phone addresses are stored in computer memory in association with the persistent unique identifier of a corresponding user. Optionally a phone address is only associated with a single persistent unique identifier for a time period duration wherein the time period duration includes for example the duration of a marketing campaign the duration of a stage in a marketing funnel the duration of a marketing state in a marketing campaign a fixed time period e.g. 5 seconds 5 minutes 5 hours 5 days 5 weeks 5 months etc. an expiration of a time period in which a user has not accessed a one or more merchants with a plurality of devices the detection of spam calling in association with the phone address etc. Optionally if a phone address is associated with a persistent unique identifier which may correspond to an individual or a household during a certain time period the phone address is not associated with other users and or persistent unique identifiers during the time period.

Optionally the unique advertisement impression phone addresses are used as a query parameter to search for and access specific persistent unique identifiers and or the information stored in association with a specific persistent unique identifier. Advantageously this association enables merchants of goods and services to provide promotions of certain goods and services to customer prospects across multiple computing devices of the customer prospect using a single phone address. Importantly this optionally further enables the merchants to track and identify voice fax and or video callers even when a call to the phone address does not originate a call from a computing device of the customer prospect.

Optionally a single phone address is assigned to a collection of persistent unique identifiers of which each identifier is associated with a user customer prospect wherein the phone address assignment is determined by an implicit or explicit attribute or collection of implicit or explicit attributes of a customer prospects wherein customer attributes are described herein and include for example but not limited to a geographic location of a customer prospect demographics psychographics etc. Optionally a single phone address is assigned to a collection of persistent unique identifiers wherein the phone address assignment is determined by the identification of a marketing campaign state in which the customer prospect resides a marketing campaign state transition and or other marketing campaign events. Optionally a single phone address is assigned to a collection of persistent unique identifiers wherein the phone address assignment is determined by the identification of a marketing funnel stage in which the customer prospect resides a marketing campaign funnel transition and or other marketing funnel events.

For example if a toll free number e.g. 800 111 1234 which may be associated with a call center is provided for display to a user in association with an ad impression the toll free number may be stored by a Web provider in association with the user s persistent unique identifier created by or received by the Web provider. If the user calls the toll free number 800 111 1234 is this illustrative example the recipient of the call e.g. a call center or the system of the applicant optionally queries one or more Web providers persistent unique identifier platform s using the called toll free number as a parameter to collect additional information e.g. Web cookie equivalent data about the caller and their web activity stored in association with the persistent unique identifier. Optionally in this example the Web provider system queries the data store to find one or more persistent unique identifiers that have been associated with and stored with the toll free number 800 111 1234 is this illustrative example .

Thus when a user calls a toll free number associated with a promotion the user s persistent unique identifier may be used to determine which promotion was provided to the user. In another example if a customer prospect places a call from a landline phone in this example an offline computing device after seeing a promotion with a phone address wherein the phone addresses is stored in association with a persistent unique identifier the system of the applicant and or a customer service center receiving a call from the landline phone number can for example by querying one or more internal or external data stores obtain certain information about the customer. A query parameter to obtain the information about the customer optionally includes the phone address associated with the promotion and or the persistent unique identifier stored in association with the phone address. Further in the example embodiment described above wherein an assigned phone address e.g. a phone address assigned from a RingPool as described herein is presented to a customer prospect in association with a promotion optionally the routing bridging of the call received by the call processing and marketing automation system can be determined based upon the persistent unique identifier or data further determined from the use of the persistent unique identifier. For example if the system determines a calling customer prospect is a high value VIP customer prospect the call optionally is routed to a fully staffed VIP trained call center dedicated to high value customers and customer prospects and providing enhanced e.g. quicker more informed service as compared to a non VIP call center.

Thus optionally persistent unique identifiers may be utilized to attribute promotions to sales and or storage of phone addresses in association with persistent unique identifiers associated with users callers.

In an example embodiment a marketing automation system includes one or more networked computing servers data stores e.g. databases networking infrastructure telephony capabilities including call routing switching and bridging and a collection of general purpose and specific e.g. voice recognition application system software as described above. In addition to the some or all of the components described above a marketing automation platform optionally includes a marketing automation software application and centralized marketing data store software analytics user interfaces dashboards and reporting. Optionally the telephony capabilities subsystem is configured remote and or separate from the marketing automation software application platform and its associated network based servers and data stores. Optionally one or more network interfaces enable data transfers between the telephony subsystems and marketing automation platform. Optionally the telephony capabilities subsystem is offered by a provider separate from the marketing automation platform provider and the systems are integrated via one or more Application Programming Interfaces APIs over a network. Optionally telephony subsystem and marketing automation platform are provided via a cloud based service and or Software as a Service SaaS model.

In this example the phone server detects the termination of the call by the caller e.g. caller hung up .

In this example the server requests the phone server terminate the call bridge between the customer caller and the call center .

The server writes a call detail record to the database the call detail record including information about the call e.g. length of the call calling party ID etc. .

The call bridging platform calculates the value of the call to the affiliate and credits the affiliate for the call by updating the database . In this example the call was determined to be of high quality because the keyword friend was detected in the voice conversation with the call center agent. In this example the call was also high quality because the incoming call from the caller customer originated from a cell phone. The advertiser configured high quality calls to be of 5 in value. Therefore the affiliate was credited in the amount of 5 for the call.

The campaign is configured to send SMS messages if the inbound call is from a cell phone. The server composes a text message Thank you for your interest in baby fans if you have any further questions visit our web site www.acmebabyfans.com and sends an SMS message to the customer caller s mobile phone from the notification module. Optionally the SMS message is sent at any point in the call including when the caller customer accepted the offer. Optionally the text message includes a telephone number.

The server receives the request and updates the database to reflect the manager s selected creative for the campaign and that the campaign is now created. The server next responds by displaying the Visibility and Approvals web page see .

The next step which in certain embodiments may be the last step in creating a campaign is determining which publishers and affiliates can access the Advertising campaign and for those whom access the campaign how the campaign manager approves their participation. In this example embodiment the campaign manager makes the campaign available to all publishers or all publishers within a specified country or geographic area by selecting the all publishers control . In this campaign the manager decides to review all participant applications by selecting the all applications control . Having completed creating the campaign and establishing campaign visibility approvals the manager selects the Done control see .

The server receives the visibility approvals selections and updates the database accordingly. In the states above the user configured data is stored at each step transition. Optionally all of the configured data can be stored in this last step in campaign creation.

With the campaign created the server displays the Campaign home web page see . The newly created campaign is displayed in the campaign summary and is available to one or more publishers affiliates.

A publisher who has applied for the campaign and been accepted would like to establish detailed tracking by configuring a RingPool. The RingPool in this example embodiment is used to track phone calls associated with advertisements placed on the publisher s web site s . The publisher selects a user interface control not shown in Figures from within the newly created 2011 Sale campaign. The manager next selects the Add New RingPool control not shown in Figures .

The server receives the request to add a new RingPool and responds by displaying the Add New RingPool web page see .

In this example embodiment the publisher decides to send the traffic to the Advertiser s landing page. The publisher selects the Advertiser landing page control see . The publisher then selects the Next control .

The server receives the Advertiser landing page selection stores the publisher selection in the system database and displays the RingPool type web page see .

The publisher in this case is tracking ad placements in the publisher s web site s and therefore selects the RingPool type Custom control . The publisher then selects the Next control .

The server receives the request to add a custom RingPool stores the publisher s selection and responds by displaying the RingPool Settings web page see .

The publisher assigns a unique name to the RingPool by entering Ad Placement into the text field . The media buyer next sets a minimum number to parameter association lifetime by selecting 10 minutes in the scroll menu control . Next the publisher enters an estimate of the number of clicks per day by entering in the site visit number entry field . The server receives the clicks per day estimate and displays a RingPool number allocation of see . The publisher then selects the Next Control .

The server receives the RingPool Settings stores the publisher selections in the system database and responds by displaying the RingPool Parameters web page see .

In this example embodiment the publisher has selected three parameters named website location and path. The publisher enters website into the Parameter name text field . The publisher enters location into the Parameter name text field . The publisher enters path into the Parameter name text field . When the publisher replaces the click through URL with the generalized tracking link into the ad placements the publisher also configures the URL with unique values for website location and path. The publisher then selects the Next control .

The server receives the three parameters stores the parameters in the system database. The server generates a general tracking URL for the publisher. The URL consists of the following key components a a path to the PM system e.g. so the PM system can track the click throughs and associate a phone address with the ad placement b a unique identifier associated with the publisher e.g. created during account setup c the named parameters. The server responds by displaying the Link Ready web page.

The publisher replaces each click through URL on the publishing company s web site with the general tracking link. For each ad placement the publisher sets the triplet parameters to unique values. In one example the publisher displays an ad at the footer of the publisher s home page. The publisher replaces the click through URL with the general tracking URL described in State 30. The publisher also specifies a unique website location and path for the home page ad e.g. website one location footer path home . Note at some point prior to state 32 in this example the News Press campaign manager inserted javascript code or its equivalent in the News Press landing page optionally code received from the PM service provider personnel which performs the task of url parsing phone address validation and phone address placement onto the landing page. 

After the publisher completes the update to the publisher s web site and the changes are live a consumer browses to the publisher s web site and after reading an article notices the News Press ad displayed on the publisher s site. The consumer clicks on the ad using for example their data terminal .

The PM system receives the web request. The PM system parses the URL. The PM system queries the system database using the publisher ID and parameters website one location footer path home . The PM system determines from the query that a phone number has not been assigned to the publisher with parameters website one location footer and path home. The PM system allocates a phone address 888 869 5345 from the pool of numbers assigned to the publisher. The assignment is stored in the system database and in this example the web request is redirected to the News Press landing page with the phone address 888 869 5345 included as a parameter in the redirect.

The News Press web server receives the web request from the PM system. The News Press web server renders the landing page. When the landing page is ready the javascript e.g. number placement code inserted by the campaign manager on the landing page see State 32 parses the url validates the phone number and maps it onto the page see .

The consumer after reading the information associated with the product decides to call the displayed phone number 888 869 5345. The consumer enters in the number 888 869 5345 in his mobile device and selects the send control. The call is routed through the public switched telephone network to the PM platform phone server .

The phone server notifies the server of the presented call along with the call signaling information associated with the call e.g. calling and called numbers direct call etc. .

The server queries the database to determine the call handling treatment for the call and optionally external databases to collect additional information about the caller 00 and calling device type of device for call rating and tracking purposes. From the calling number the server determines the caller is calling from a cell phone.

Since the called phone number 800 123 4567 is associated with the News Press campaign the call treatment is to record the call so the phone server begins to record the call and play an interactive menu to the caller. The server requests the phone server answer the call begin recording the call and play the call recorded warning and voice menu configured for this campaign.

The phone server answers the incoming call and plays the voice prompt to the customer caller and or customer s mobile device This call is being recorded. If you are trying to reach The News Press press 1. If you misdialed please hang up. 

In this example the caller presses one on their phone keypad in response to hearing the voice prompt.

The phone server detects a dual tone multi frequency tone dtmf one. The phone server notifies the server of the dtmf event.

The server requests the phone server generate an outbound call to the configured phone number address 888 555 1234 that is the destination phone number of the News Press Santa Barbara call center .

The phone server plays the voice prompt to the customer caller Thank you for calling The News Press. We are transferring your call. 

The server requests the phone server bridge the inbound call from the customer caller to the outbound call to the call center .

The phone server bridges the inbound call from the customer caller to the outbound call to the call center .

After closing the sale the caller hangs up. In this example the phone server detects the termination of the call by the caller .

In this example the server requests the phone server terminate the call bridge between the customer caller and the call center .

In this example the phone server terminates the outbound call to the call center . The phone server terminates recording of the call.

The server writes a call detail record to the database the call detail record including information about the call e.g. length of the call calling party ID etc. . The server also stores the recorded call in association with News Press campaign.

The call bridging platform calculates the value of the call to the publisher and credits the publisher for the call by updating the database . In this example the call originated in California and was greater than 2 minutes. Therefore the publisher is credited the amount of 15 for the call.

Later that evening the publisher logged into the system steps not shown and requests a transaction detail report by selecting the transaction report control not shown .

The server receives the transaction report control selection and displays a listing of all transactions associated with the publisher. Transaction number details the call described. The RingPool number 888 869 5345 is listed along with the unique tracking parameters which it was associated with in State 34 above website one location footer path home 1 see .

Sometime later a second consumer Sally browses to the publisher s web site and reads several articles on the publisher s website. On the third page Sally notices the News Press ad displayed on the publisher s site. Sally clicks on the ad displayed not the same ad clicked on by John .

The PM system receives the web request. The PM system parses the URL. The PM system queries the system database using the parsed URL including publisher ID and parameters web site one location footer path page3. The PM system determines from the query that a phone number has not been assigned to the publisher with parameters website one location footer and path page3. The PM system checks the maximum size compared to the current pool size and determines that additional numbers may be allocated. The PM system allocates a phone address 800 123 8888 to the pool of numbers assigned to the publisher. The assignment is stored in the system database and in this example the web request is redirected to the News Press landing page with the phone address 800 123 8888 included as a parameter in the redirect.

The News Press web server receives the web request from the PM system.

Next the media buyer specifies an estimate of the number of clicks per day by entering in the site visit number entry field . The server receives the clicks per day or other time period estimate and displays a RingPool number allocation of see . The media buyer then selects the Next control .

The server receives the RingPool Settings and stores the media buyer selections in the system database. The server generates a general tracking URL for the media buyer. The URL consists of the following key components a a path to the PM system e.g. so the PM system can track the click throughs and associate a phone address with the ad placement b a unique identifier associated with the media buyer e.g. account ID created during account setup c the keyword and search engine. The server responds by displaying the Link Ready web page.

The media buyer replaces each click through URL on the paid search ads with the general tracking link. The media buyer purchases hundreds of search keyword phrases including Local Newspaper and Santa Barbara News across multiple search engines.

A consumer Jane enters the search phrase Local Newspaper into a search engine query field e.g. associated with a third party search site such as Google . The search engine responds to the search request by displaying a list of results and paid ads including the media buyer s ad. Jane clicks on the media buyer s displayed ad.

As similarly discussed elsewhere herein one or more phone addresses may be associated with a campaign of an entity. A record of such an association may be stored in a data store accessible by a system such as the affiliate network software platform described elsewhere herein. A communication such as an advertisement e.g. an online advertisement e.g. a product or service promotion an email advertisement or other advertisement may be provided to one more customer prospects which may include both existing customers of the entity and recipients that are not currently customers of the entity via a customer prospect terminal e.g. mobile computer phone laptop computer networked television radio or other device . A call placed by a customer prospect to one of the phone numbers may be received at the system along with call signaling information. The call signaling information may include a calling phone address of the customer prospect and or a called phone address the phone number included in the communication which the customer prospect called . The system may answer the customer prospect call and prompt the customer prospect e.g. audibly prompt the customer prospect using an IVR system or otherwise to provide information or make a selection e.g. as described elsewhere herein or otherwise for example the customer prospect may be asked to indicate what product or service the customer prospect is interested in .

Based at least in part on the calling phone address of the customer prospect or the called phone address or the customer prospect s response selection or any combination comprising the foregoing the system may query one or more data stores e.g. one or more data stores that store demographic psychographic web browsing data personal data social networking data and or other data to determine one or more implicitly and or explicitly defined attributes associated with the customer prospect e.g. demographic attributes psychographic attributes web browsing attributes other personal attributes social networking attributes and or other attributes . The system may initiate an outbound call connection e.g. based at least in part on the phone number called by the customer prospect to a destination e.g. a centralized call center where multiple call center agents may be co located or a distributed call center where the call center agents may be located in different locations such as their homes . The outbound call connection may enable voice and or data communications and may optionally be in the form of a VoIP call. The system may transmit to a call center computer system via the call connection e.g. via a SIP message one or more of the determined attributes associated with the customer prospect. For example the system may populate one or more fields of a message e.g. a SIP message with such attributes. The attributes may be displayed to a call center agent via a terminal and or ingested and processed by a call center application e.g. for scoring or other purposes such as those disclosed elsewhere herein . The system may bridge the customer prospect s call with the outbound call connection to enable the customer prospect speak with a call center agent and or IVR system.

In the foregoing example the system processing the incoming call is external to the call center system and may be operated by a different entity e.g. a marketing campaign service provider . Optionally the system may be integrated with and co located with the call center system. As discussed elsewhere herein a user interface control may be provided via the call center agent terminal via which the call center agent e.g. in communication with the customer prospect can cause at least in part the customer prospect to exit from the marketing campaign. As also discussed elsewhere herein the marketing campaign may include a plurality of states and a marketing campaign state of the customer prospect may optionally be associated with an indication as to the likelihood that the customer prospect will be a customer for the good or service being promoted and or an indication of the position of the customer prospect in a marketing campaign funnel and or an indication as to the number of communications and or the number of communication attempts with the customer prospect.
