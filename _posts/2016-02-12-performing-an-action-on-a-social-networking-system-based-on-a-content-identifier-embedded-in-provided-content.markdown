title: Performing an action on a social networking system based on a content identifier embedded in provided content
abstract: A content source provides metadata associated with content, such as an audio signal or video data, to a social networking system. The metadata identifies characteristics of the content or specifies an action for the social networking system to perform. A content identifier associated with the metadata is generated by the social networking system, and an association between the content identifier and the metadata is stored. The content identifier is provided to the content source, which encodes the content identifier into the content (e.g., as a watermark). When a client device receives the content encoded with the content identifier, the content identifier is extracted and communicated to the social networking system in connection with a user account associated with the client device. Based on the content identifier, the social networking system retrieves the corresponding metadata and performs an action in connection with the user account based on the metadata.

This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 933 585 filed Jul. 2 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention relates generally to retrieving information associated with retrieved content and more specifically to performing an action based on information embedded in content.

Real time identification of audio signals is being increasingly used in various applications. For example many systems use various audio signal identification schemes to identify the name artist and or album of an unknown song. Currently various audio signal identification schemes have been developed. In one class of schemes an audio fingerprint is generated for an audio signal where the audio fingerprint includes characteristic information about the audio signal usable for identifying the audio signal. The characteristic information about the audio signal may be based on acoustical and perceptual properties of the audio signal. To identify an audio signal an audio fingerprint generated from the audio signal is compared to a database of reference audio fingerprints.

However a content provider may wish to provide additional information to users receiving content. For example the content provider may seek to provide information about the content provider or disseminate information about the content provider or content to other users. Conventional audio fingerprints merely allow a content provider to present information describing an audio signal or other content and do not allow a content provider to supplement the identification information with other functionality.

A content source associates metadata with content provided by the content source. For example the metadata identifies an artist or creator of the content a location associated with the content or content source an identifier of the content source. The metadata may include information associated with one or more actions to be performed by a social networking system when a social networking system user receives the content via a client device. For example the metadata identifies an action for the social networking system to perform and includes information for performing the action. Examples of actions identified by the metadata include executing an application identified by the metadata storing data identified by the metadata communicating data identified by the metadata to users of the social networking system identifying an advertisement based on information in the metadata and associating the user with a location identified by the metadata.

The content source provides the metadata associated with the content to the social networking system which generates a content identifier uniquely identifying the metadata. An association between the metadata and the content identifier is stored by the social networking system and the content identifier is communicated to the content source. The content source embeds the content identifier into its corresponding content e.g. as a watermark and provides the content to a client device. For example the content source broadcasts an audio signal encoded with the content identifier.

When a client device associated with a user of the social networking system receives the content the client device extracts the content identifier from the content. For example an application associated with the social networking system and executing on the client device extracts the content identifier from the content. The extracted content identifier is communicated from the client device to the social networking system which retrieves the metadata associated with the content identifier. If the metadata specifies an action the social networking system performs the action specified by the metadata and communicates data describing or generated by the action to the client device or to additional social networking system users.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The client devices are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the social networking system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the social networking system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

Additionally a client device may include one or more audio capture devices such as one or more microphones configured to capture audio data from an environment surrounding the client device . A client device may also include one or more image capture devices. For example the client device includes a camera or video recording device. This allows a client device to capture audio and or video content from an environment surrounding the client device . For example the client device captures audio or video data provided by a content source using an audio capture device or an image capture device respectively. Further the client device includes one or more applications that extract information from received content. For example an application associated with the social networking system is executed by the client device to extract a content identifier from content received by the client device and to communicate the content identifier to the social networking system .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with the social networking system which is further described below in conjunction with . In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device or communicating data to client devices for use by an application executing on the client device. In other embodiments a third party system provides content or other information for presentation via a client device . A third party system may also communicate information to the social networking system such as advertisements content or information about an application provided by the third party system .

The content source provides content to a client device using any suitable channel. For example the content source is any entity suitable for generating audio or a representation of audio such as a speakers of a mobile device speakers of a stereo or other device producing audio content a desktop computer transmitting representing of a song or other suitable entity generating audio. As another example the content source is any entity suitable for generating video or image data such as a computer display a television a display device of a mobile device an image or any other suitable entity presenting video or image data.

As further described above in conjunction with the content source may specify metadata describing one or more characteristics of the content. For example the metadata identifies an artist or creator of the content a location associated with the content or content source an identifier of the content source . Additionally the metadata may include information associated with one or more actions performed by the social networking system . For example the metadata identifies an action for the social networking system to perform and includes information for performing the action. Examples of actions identified by the metadata include executing an application identified by the metadata storing data identified by the metadata communicating data identified by the metadata to users of the social networking system identifying an advertisement based on information in the metadata and associating the user with a location identified by the metadata. As described further in conjunction with the content source identifies the metadata to the social networking system and receives a content identifier that the social networking system uses to retrieve the metadata. The content source embeds the content identifier into its corresponding content allowing a client device to extract the content identifier and communicate the content identifier to the social networking system which provides the client device with information based on the metadata associated with the content identifier.

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding social networking system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with information identifying the social networking system users displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the social networking system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the social networking system for connecting and exchanging content with other social networking system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the social networking system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the social networking system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that each represent various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Social networking system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the social networking system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence social networking system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the social networking system through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the social networking system .

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as with other applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the social networking system . For example an e commerce website may recognize a user of a social networking system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as in the preceding example may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the social networking system to the social networking system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system .

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and objects or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the social networking system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object or another user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest for an object interest or other user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or RIM .

The social networking system generates a content identifier uniquely identifying the metadata and its associated content and transmits the content identifier to the content source via the network . Additionally the social networking system stores the metadata the content identifier and an association between the content identifier and the metadata. For example the social networking system maintains a table in the content store including pairs of content identifiers and associated metadata. This allows the social networking system to efficiently subsequently retrieve metadata associated with a content identifier.

In some embodiments the content source provides multiple items of metadata associated with content to the social networking system and the social networking system generates different content identifiers associated with each item of metadata. The different content identifiers are transmitted to the content source via the network and stored by the social networking system in association with their respective item of metadata. This allows the content source to embed multiple content identifiers in the content when it is provided to a client device . For example a content identifier embedded in the content corresponds to an audio fingerprint identifying the content while a different content identifier embedded in the content corresponds to metadata identifying the content source or identifying a type of channel used to provide the content to the client device . Including multiple content identifiers in content allows the content provider to convey a variety of information describing the content or to identify a variety of actions to be performed when the content is identified by a user.

Upon receiving the content identifier from the social networking system the content source embeds the content identifier into the content. When the content provider subsequently provides the content to a client device associated with a user of the social networking system the content identifier is provided to the client device along with the content. For example if the content source is generating an audio signal with an embedded content identifier the client device captures the audio signal via one or more microphones and an application executing on the client device processes the audio signal and extracts the content identifier. As another example if the content source is presenting video data the client device captures the video data through an image capture device and an application execution on the client device extracts the content identifier from the video data.

The client device transmits the extracted content identifier to the social networking system via the network and the social networking system retrieves stored metadata associated with the content identifier. For example the social networking system identifies a pair of content identifier and metadata from the content store using the extracted content identifier. Based on the retrieved metadata the social networking system performs an action. Information describing the action or generated by the action may also communicated from the social networking system to the client device or to additional client devices .

Various actions may be performed by the social networking system based on the retrieved metadata allowing a content provider to influence user interaction by providing the social networking system with metadata associated with content. For example the social networking system identifies an application from the metadata and executes the application when the content identifier is received. Information from the application may be presented via the client device to a user. As another example the social networking system uses the metadata to select an advertisement and subsequently presents the selected advertisement via the client device . Additionally the social networking system may retrieve information describing the content e.g. location artist title synopsis etc. from the metadata and use the retrieved information to perform an action also identified by the metadata. For example the social networking system may notify other users connected to the user of the client device of the user and information describing the content from the metadata. As another example the social networking system may present an interface to the user of the client device including information retrieved from the metadata allowing the user to augment the information with additional data. Additional examples of actions for the social networking system to perform based on metadata associated with a received content identifier are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 250 145 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
