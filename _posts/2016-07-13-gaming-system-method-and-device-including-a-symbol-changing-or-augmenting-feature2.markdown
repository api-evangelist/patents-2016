No. 61 413 196 filed Nov. 12 2010 and entitled A Gaming System Method and Device Including a Symbol Changing or Augmenting Feature each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The field of the invention relates to methods and apparatus for gaming of the type which display symbols defining an outcome. More particularly it relates to systems methods and devices which include a feature to change or augment one or more outcomes of a base game by selection of modifiers from one or more modifier data sets stored locally or remotely in memory.

Gaming devices such as casino gaining devices e.g. slot machines have been popular for over a century. Initially such devices were mechanical devices presenting one or more mechanical spinning reels to randomly select and display winning or losing outcomes at a single pay line. Modernly such devices are computer controlled and some include video displays electro mechanical stepper motor controlled physical reels or combinations thereof. Typically these devices display game symbols for the play of a base game and perhaps offer one or more secondary games sometimes referred to as bonus or feature games. For example for a video device the game may present a base game depicting video images of five reels each with three symbol display row positions producing a 3 row 5 column matrix of positions for symbols. One or more pay lines are provided. Under control of the computer processor the video display depicts the reels spinning and stopping to arrange the game symbols in the matrix and where a predetermined winning combination of symbols is obtained on a wagered upon i.e. enabled pay line or pay arrangement the player receives a prize. Of course the foregoing description should not be deemed to be limiting since awards may be issued for symbols scatted in the matrix i.e. a scatter pay and some symbols may trigger additional features such as a secondary game. Further game symbols may be a hand of cards such as for video Blackjack or video Poker one or Keno Bingo or Lottery cards or the like with different rules of play as is known in the art.

The prior art the spinning reel games whether video or electro mechanical typically have fixed defined physical or virtual reel strips. For mechanical reels the reel strips are printed on a substrate and hence are in fixed positions. The rotation and stopping of the reels is controlled by stepper motors and include a defined number of stops . Typically a symbol symbol as used herein unless otherwise defined includes blank positions on the reel where there is no graphic symbol position is assigned to a stop position. A mechanical reel may have for example 22 stops. Of course a computer control may include many more virtual stops with the ability to map the computer selected stop to the physical stop on the reel strip as described in Telnaes U.S. Pat. No. 4 448 419 issued May 15 1984 and titled Electronic Gaming Device Utilizing a Random Number Generator for Selecting the Reel Stop Positions the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. A controller from a known index stop controls the reel to a stop position to display the selected symbol.

It has been known to provide a game which includes outcome modifier reels. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7 377 850 titled Gaining Device Having Multiple Bonuses Acting Independently of Simultaneously the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference discloses a gaming device having reels which spin to define an outcome for a base game and one or more modifier reels which spin to display modifiers such as multipliers for the base game and or separate awards.

It is believed that the concept of providing modifiers to alter or augment the outcome of a base game has not been fully utilized. It would be advantageous to be able to apply modifiers to game outcomes without having to add one or more modifier reels to a game display. For an existing game it would be advantageous if modifiers could be added to the game without significant alteration of the base game to thereby alter the game s pay structure provide progressive prizes and refresh the architecture of the game. For new games it would be advantageous if modifiers could be used to provide the designers with numerous options for the game architecture such as how the modifiers will be displayed if at all which reels can be affected by modifiers how the modifiers will affect the function of the game and whether the character of the game by addition of the modifiers will change during various triggered features.

It would also be advantageous of the possible addition of modifiers could be triggered by game events internal to the game or by event criteria from an external source such as a external trigger from a connected network a certain time or date a event occurring on another game or other predetermined or randomly occurring criteria.

In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a gaming device of the type displaying game symbols of N game reels and apparatus for the player to make a wager and initiate play. The device includes a data structure storing for at least one reel data corresponding to a plurality of modifier sets. This data may correspond to modifiers which confer multipliers Wild functionalities prizes base game symbol movement i.e. symbols exchanging positions triggers for other features and games free game triggers or other functionalities. A game controller is configured to randomly select and display at said display at least one game symbol for each reel to define one or more winning or losing base game outcomes and to randomly select from one or more modifier sets one or more modifiers to apply to at least one reel. The modifiers may be displayed as symbols or other effects to the base game or its symbols to may be hidden from view to provide a mystery modification for the player. The modifier s selected function to altering or augment the base game outcome or provide other additional functionality to the game such as triggering a feature or the like.

In a further embodiment the controller is configured to upon satisfaction of certain criteria select a modifier data set and select one or more modifiers from that set. The selection may be defined or may be random. For example where a set of free games has been won the controller may be configured to select for one or more reels a modifier data set which includes data to confer upon game symbols a Wild functionality to alter the hit frequency or other characteristic of the game.

in any embodiment the modifier sets can have data representing any number of modifiers. The selection of the modifiers can be coupled or uncoupled from the symbols of the base game. By coupling what is meant is that a modifier is selected for each symbol or stop of the base game reel and becomes coupled to the base game symbols.

The modifiers may be displayed or hidden. When displayed they may be displayed as overlays borders smaller symbols adjoining a base game symbol flashing symbols or the like.

In some configurations the application of modifiers may be triggered by the base game such as the selection of one or more base game symbols by an event or condition divorced from the base game such as a random event or events or conditions outside of the base game such as by a network command or the like.

The modifiers can be applied to an existing game which may or may not require some adjustment to the base game architecture. For example an existing game may have a free game feature which simply results in ten free game spins. By providing the modifier data structure and configuring the game controller during the free game set modifiers may be selected to confer a Wild condition on one or more symbols or offer a multiplier of a base game award provide for additional awards including progressives or the like to reinvigorate an existing game. The application of modifiers may require an additional wager such as for example where the modifiers represent a separate game or separate progressive game from the base game

For new games designers can use base game feature games and modifier data sets to configure new and exciting features to games. For example certain modifiers may trigger feature games may cause base or feature game symbols to move such as a nudge or transposition feature to confer a wild condition on one or more base or feature game symbols to play a secondary game which may offer a progressive prize to display for accumulation symbols which when a certain number have been acquired open a new feature of the game to the player or any other feature the designer may have in mind.

Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numbers denote like or corresponding elements throughout the drawings and more particularly referring to there is shown an embodiment of a gaining device which may be employed according to apparatus system and methods of the present invention. The gaming device includes a cabinet housing primary game display upon which a primary game sometimes referred to as a base game and feature bonus or community games may be displayed top box which may display multiple progressives that may be won during play of the primary bonus or feature game or a modifier based game one or more player activated input devices such as buttons or by providing touch screen functionality to the primary screen display . A player tracking module and a bill voucher acceptor may also be provided. One or more speakers may also be mounted on the housing to provide sounds to the player for example scripted with the play of the game.

Cabinet housing . houses one or more processors circuitry data structures in the form of memory devices such as EEPROMS flash memory hard drive memory and software not shown configured for the operation of the gaming device as hereinafter described. Any shaped cabinet housing may be implemented with any embodiment of gaming device so long as it provides access to a player for playing a game. For example cabinet housing may comprise a slant top bar top or table top style cabinet as is known in the art.

The plurality of player activated buttons may be used for various functions such as but not limited to selecting a wager denomination selecting a game to be played selecting a wager amount per game initiating a game selecting the number of pay lines to enable i.e. wager upon or cashing out money from gaming device . Buttons function as input mechanisms and may include mechanical buttons electromechanical buttons or touch screen buttons. Optionally a handle may be pulled by a player to initiate a game.

In other embodiments buttons may be replaced with various other input mechanisms known in the art such as but not limited to a touch screen system touch pad track ball mouse switches toggle switches control joy stick or other input means used to accept player input. For example one input means is a universal button module as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 106 212 entitled Universal Button Module filed on Apr. 14 2005 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. Generally the universal button module provides a dynamic button system adaptable for use with various games and capable of adjusting to gaming systems having frequent game changes. More particularly the universal button module may be used in connection with playing a game on a gaming machine and may be used for such functions as selecting the number of credits to bet per hand. In other embodiments a virtual button deck may be used to provide similar capabilities. An example of a virtual button deck is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 938 203 entitled Game Related Systems Methods and Articles That Combine Virtual and Physical Elements filed on Nov. 9 2007 hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.

The cabinet housing may optionally include the top box which contains top glass comprising advertising or payout information related to the game or games available on gaming device . The glass may be replaced by a video display configured to display the aforesaid advertising and payout information or to display one or more features of a game progressive prize information of the like.

The player tracking module as is known in the art includes a player tracking card reader and a player tracking display . The voucher printer may be integrated into player tracking module or installed elsewhere in cabinet housing or top box . The player tracking module also includes a system interface input device such as a keypad or as by including touch screen input functionality at the player tracking display . Functionally the player tracking module provides a communication interface between the gaming device and one or more systems such as the player tracking system and or a slot accounting system. As is known in the art the player tracking module may also provide or communicate data such as gaming device meter information i.e. coin in coin out jackpots or other selected and configured events including maintenance progressive community gaming or other events. It should be understood that some communications between the gaming device and any connected system may or may not pass through or communicate with the player tracking module . Some functionality of the player tracking module may include displays at all or a portion of the primary game display and or top glass display.

The primary game display presents a game of chance wherein in response to a wager a player receives one or more outcomes from a set of potential outcomes. Mechanical or video mechanical embodiments may include game displays such as a window or glass for viewing a number of electro mechanical stepper reels as is known in the art or employment of a wheel for displaying selecting either a primary game outcome or a bonus game outcome. In a video embodiment the primary game display is typically a CRT or a flat panel display in the form of but not limited to liquid crystal plasma electroluminescent vacuum fluorescent field emission laser or any other type of panel display known or developed in the art. The primary game display may be mounted in either a portrait or landscape orientation and be of standard or widescreen dimensions i.e. a ratio of one dimension to another of at least 16 9 . A widescreen display in a portrait orientation may be 32 inches tall by 18 inches wide. Additionally primary game display as referenced above may include a touch screen or touch glass system not shown . The touch screen functionality may be in lieu of or in addition to input buttons . An example of a touch glass system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 942 571 entitled Gaming Device with Direction and Speed Control of Mechanical Reels Using Touch Screen which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The primary game display may is configured to present to a player wagering games such as a video or electro mechanical reel slot game a video keno game a lottery game a bingo game a Class II bingo game a roulette game a craps game a blackjack game a mechanical or video representation of a wheel game video Poker or other game. Additionally the primary game display alone or perhaps in conjunction with a top glass video device may be configured to present one or more feature or additional games.

The primary game display may also present information such as but not limited to player information advertisements and casino promotions graphic displays news and sports updates or even offer an alternate game. This information may be generated at the gaming device or through a host computer networked with gaming device on its own initiative or it may be obtained by request of the player using either one or more of the plurality of player activated buttons the primary game display itself if game display comprises a touch screen or similar technology buttons not shown mounted about primary game display which may permit selections such as those found on an ATM machine where legends on the screen are associated with respective selecting buttons or any player input device that offers the required functionality.

As stated above the gaming device is adapted to provide a game of chance to a player. shows a typical display of a base game of change which may be displayed. The base game is for example displayed at the primary game display and includes a game matrix defined by rows and columns of symbols. Symbols as used herein can include blanks. The columns are often displayed as reels with the rows depicted as symbols on those reels reminiscent of the traditional mechanical reel games. The rows and columns define 15 coordinates or symbol locations for the game matrix . The display may also include several informational markers. For example the game depicted in FIG. is a 30 line game which means the player has the ability to wager upon 30 pay lines which traverse virtually the matrix in a known fashion. Along the sides of the matrix are line identifiers . As a player wagers upon i.e. enables a pay line the corresponding identifier is highlighted. When an award is won on a pay line the corresponding identifier may also be lighted to tell the player which line had a winning symbol arrangement.

Below the matrix several touch screen buttons or meters may be shown. A game info button is a touch screen button which opens a display of game information such as how to play the game the awards pays and features. At is a denomination indicator showing that the displayed game is a 1 credit game. Credit meter bet meter and win meter display respectively the credits available to the player for wagering the amount of the current bet and the amount won from the spin.

Turning to operation of an embodiment of a prior art base game will be described. Each column has a corresponding reel strip data set . While only one reel strip data set is shown in it should be understood that there would be such a set for each reel. The reel strip data set may include code addresses shown as 1 22 for illustrative purposes which control a graphic software engine and graphic memory which correspond to the display of a symbol. The reel strip data set typically has a fixed number of addresses which correspond to symbols . By making the reel strip data set larger or smaller the game designer can control a games performance architecture such as hit frequency average plays before a win and probabilities of symbols or symbol combinations appearing. The reel strip data sets for the reels may have a different number of addresses and may address different symbols e.g. a Wild symbol may only be used in the center reel column By matching these probabilities with awards the designer can craft a symbol PAR probability and accounting sheets for the game. This PAR sheet will set forth all of the winning combinations for the game the corresponding probability of occurrence and the award. By summing the individual numbers the overall payback to the player can be determined. Some gaming jurisdictions require that the payback be at least a certain minimum e.g. 80 for every dollar wagered theoretically the player should win 80 .

Continuing with when a player initiates a play a controller uses a random number generator to randomly select an address for each reel strip data set which is then mapped to the center row for each reel. The data corresponding to the symbols for columns c are also taken from the reel strip data set so that the symbols retain their adjacent relationship as defined at the reel strip data set . The corresponding symbols are displayed in the matrix and winning or losing outcomes are determined.

Other techniques may be used. For example once an address is selected the adjacent symbols may be defined.

While the foregoing description of the prior art was directed to a video based spinning reel game the same description may be applied to an electro mechanical stepper reel game.

Further the prior art games may include several variations. For example sonic games include features such as scatter pays which issue an award whether or not the symbol or symbol combination is on an enabled pay line. That is the winning combination can be scattered in the matrix . Some games do not use pay lines but rather use pay arrangements such as the game described in Bennett U.S. Pat. No. 6 093 102 titled Multiline Gaming Machine the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this game a player wagers upon symbol arrangements rather than pay lines.

As can be appreciated game designers are constrained by the static nature of the reel strip data sets inasmuch as they are tied to the physical reel strips which will be displayed. That is the symbol adjacency on the virtual reel strip must be maintained. The 9 for column must for this portion of the virtual reel strip remain between the symbols for the Sydney Opera House and the Castle . To try to provide some variation features have been added to games such as free game sets Wild symbols feature games such as pick a prize games or spinning wheel games or the like. These features though are often tied to the base game having trigger symbols which must be selected to trigger the feature. Thus the addition of a feature results in alteration of the base game and its architecture. If the game is a modification of an existing game the alteration may cause loyal players to turn away from the existing game. There is a need for a game to be provided with the ability to be modified without altering or significantly altering the base game architecture or look and feel with the ability to add a feature to a game without altering the underlying base game and with the ability to add features triggered or provided from additional sources to increase the excitement of the game.

Turning now to the gaming device hardware for its various controller s is shown for purposes of illustration. The hardware software firmware and operating platforms for a game can vary without departing from the scope of the present invention The hardware includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player system interface devices over buses Gaining voucher ticket printer for printing player cash out tickets is connected to PIE and GMU over buses . EGM Processor Board PM and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over buses . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus . Ethernet switch may also connect to a server based gaming server or a downloadable gaming server. GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus . Speakers produce sounds related to the game or according to the present invention connect through audio mixer and buses to EGM Processor Board and PM .

Peripherals connect through bus to EGM Processor Board The peripherals include but are not limited to the following and may include individual processing capability bill ticket acceptor to validate and accept currency and ticket vouchers player loyalty card reader the player interfaces including features to support the touch screen gesture functionality such as buttons primary game display and secondary display with or without touch screen functionality monitors and lights reel control units where the gaming terminal is a stepper game and biometric reading capturing devices if any . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to the game input output board of the EGM processing board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. The I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming device operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. EGM processor board executes a game program that causes the gaming device to display and play a game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming device housing examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of bus to the I O board and to EGM processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming device by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via a player interface such as the buttons . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as the handle button such as a SPIN RESET button touch screen icon or depressing a button or pulling the handle . The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more of the primary and or secondary displays. In some embodiments the random number generator may be physically separate from gaming terminal for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on the primary game display or a display constituting all or a portion of the top glass .

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server. The gaming device may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the gaming device are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Sonic or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming device using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and CAM processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to a player card reader component in through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus player system interface display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive system interface display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with the display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices i.e. devices of the player tracking module are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming device . The system components include the iVIEW device iView is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming Inc. processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board may provide the functionality of the player tracking module . These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example BTU s over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

In an alternative embodiment the player system interface including the player tracking display may instead be presented upon command or request by the player as all or a portion of the primary game display as what is referred to a system interface window or service window. Where the primary game display has touch screen functionality upon command or a request the content at the primary game display such as a video reel game display is sized to accommodate the service window display at the primary game display . The touch screen functionality for the primary game display is configured to enable the player to interact with the interface through touch screen controls buttons sliders arrows etc. .

Turning to is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of processor board uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . According to the present invention the API may include the software module s such as the faceAPI referenced above for face tracking as well as the software module s for rendering the virtual reality images based upon detected motion parallax. These software applications may be stored in a suitable memory device such as a flash memory thumb drive or the like. The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of high level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The high level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager . which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

Progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming device events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. RING manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

A credit manager object not shown manages the current state of c edits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons at the user interface every two milliseconds These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module where a coin token hopper is provided must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

In many cases the gaming device will be connected to one or more systems. illustrates a casino gaming system that may include one or more gaming devices and one or more servers. Networking components facilitate communications between a backend system and game management units that control displays for carousels of gaming devices across a network. Game management units GMU s in connect the gaming devices to networking components and may be installed in the gaming device housing or external to the gaming device . The function of the GMU is similar to the function of a network interface card connected to a desktop personal computer PC . Some GMU s have much greater capability and can perform such tasks as presenting and playing a game using a display not shown operatively connected to the GMU . In one embodiment the GMU is a separate component located outside the gaming device . Alternatively in another embodiment the GMU is located within the gaming device as the player tracking module . Optionally in an alternative embodiment one or more gaming devices connect directly to a network and are not connected to a GMU .

The gaming devices are connected via a network to a network bridge which is used for networking routing and polling gaming devices including slot machines. The network bridge connects to the back end system . Optionally the gaming devices may connect to the network via a network rack which provides for a few numbers of connections to the back end system . Both network bridge and network rack may be classified as middleware and facilitate communications between the back end system and the GMUs . The network bridges and network rack may comprise data repositories for storing network performance data. Such performance data may be based on network traffic and other network related information. Optionally the network bridge and the network rack may be interchangeable components. For example in one embodiment a casino gaming system may comprise only network bridges and no network racks . Alternatively in another embodiment a casino gaming system may comprise only network racks and no network bridges . Additionally in an alternative embodiment a casino gaming system may comprise any combination of one or more network bridges and one or more network racks .

The back end system may be configured to comprise one or more servers as hereinafter described. The type of server employed is generally determined by the platform and software requirements of the gaming system. In one embodiment as illustrated in the back end system is configured to include three servers a slot floor controller a casino management server and a casino database . As described with reference to the casino resort enterprise may include other servers. The slot floor controller is a part of the player tracking system for gathering accounting security and player specific information. The casino management server and casino database work together to store and process information specific to both employees and players. Player specific information includes but is not limited to passwords biometric identification player card identification and biographic data. Additionally employee specification information may include biographic data biometric information job level and rank passwords authorization codes and security clearance levels.

Overall the back end system performs several functions. For example the back end system can collect data from the slot floor as communicated to it from other network components and maintain the collected data in its database. The back end system may use slot floor data to generate a report used in casino operation functions. Examples of such reports include but are not limited to accounting reports security reports and usage reports. The back end system may also pass data to another server for other functions. Alternatively the back end system may pass data stored on its database to floor hardware for interaction with a game or game player. For example data such as a game player s name or the amount of a ticket being redeemed at a game may be passed to the floor hardware. Additionally the back end system may comprise one or more data repositories for storing data. Examples of types of data stored in the system server data repositories include but are not limited to information relating to individual player play data individual game accounting data gaming terminal accounting data cashable ticket data sound data and optimal display configurations for one or more displays for one or more system game. In certain embodiments the back end system may include game download functionality to download and change the game played on the gaming devices provide server based gaming or provide some or all of the data processing including if desired graphics processing as described herein to the gaming devices .

Of course one will appreciate that a gaming system may also comprise other types of components and the above illustrations are meant only as examples and not as limitations to the types of components or games used in a casino gaming system. For example the gaming system may include a server which can trigger events from predetermined or random criteria to cause modifiers as hereinafter described to be imported into a game to provide additional functionality awards or features.

Turning now back to there is shown a base game display matrix of the type described above. To provide additional functionality and features to the game according to an embodiment of the present invention there is provided for at least one column reel and in addition to any applicable reel strip data set one or a plurality of data structures defining modifier data sets. The data structures store data including one or more modifier functionalities. The data may be stored in a fashion similar to that of the reel strip data sets as suggested in or it may simply be data stored in any fashion that facilitates random selection from a memory. For example one data structure for the fifth reel column may include addresses similar to the reel strip data set for the fifth reel. The data structure at one address may include data corresponding to a multiplier and at another address data which if selected confers a Wild function. The remainder of the addresses may contain nothing or Blank or Null functions i.e. confers no functionality or effect. Before during or after the selection of the base game symbols data is selected from the data structure and either assigned tied to a symbol of the virtual reel for column or is assigned to a coordinate position in column with a base game symbol. The selection from the data structure may be random or may be scripted or forced as desired by the game designer. The selection and application of any modifier can occur before during or after the display of the base game symbols. Where the data structure has the same number of data addresses the selection of the base game symbols and any modifier data can be coupled That is the data structure would act as a virtual reel overlaying the reel defining column and the two would be indexed together by the selection of the base game symbols and the modifiers and act as if thereafter rotated together. Alternatively the data structure is uncoupled from the base game reel symbol data structure as described above. Uncoupling permits alternate and a plurality of data structures as shown.

As depicted in a plurality of data structures may correspond to one or more or all reels defining the columns . The data structures may include different modifier data in different distributions with other modifier data and or blanks. For example where no modifier effect is to be provided to a base game symbol set for a reel the data structure for the reel may only contain blanks. Where the data structure is to contain only Wild functionality one or more data addresses may contain data corresponding to conferring a Wild functionality with blanks. Thus the data structures can be configured as desired and their application can be either by a default instruction or may be triggered by internal or external cues. The selection of the modifier data structures can be random or as specifically chosen.

It should be understood that while three data structures are shown more or fewer can be provided. Alternatively a library of data structures may be provided which are available for application to some or all columns of the base game. Based upon certain criteria the software code for the game may be pointed to a particular modifier data structure of the library for selection of modifier data. Thus for any reel the designer can point to a modifier data structure for the selection of the modifier.

If a feature is triggered at the player plays the feature. As but a non limiting example if the feature is a set of free spins the player may prompt the start of play of the sets. The feature may be configured to randomly multiply winning outcomes. In this instance for each spin the game controller would select from a modifier data structure which includes one or more multipliers and if 1 a multiplier is selected 2 the multiplier is to be applied to a base game symbol selected and falling into the game matrix such as suggested in and 3 the multiplier is included in a winning pay line or pay arrangement then any award would be multiplied. By configuring the modifier data structure the probabilities of selecting a multiplier are known and can be summed into the PAR determination for the overall game.

It should be understood that the availability of the modifier functionality described herein may require a separate wager. Otherwise the contribution of the modifier elements to the game can be assessed with base game and feature game contributions to craft a game with the desired performance.

As stated above the selection and application of any modifier may be triggered external to the game such as at the network level. With reference to description for the gaming device is connected to a gaming system . The gaming system may include a function to trigger the selection of modifiers for a game. For example the system may track the play on all gaming devices on the network and when certain criteria has been satisfied such as total jackpots paid total wagers coin in toward a progressive prize or other satisfaction of other predetermined criteria or a random selection process resulting in a trigger a command may be sent to one or more gaming devices resulting in the selection and possibly application of modifiers to a game. The command may be to select and apply any modifiers to the next game. The command may be to select modifiers as a second game toward winning a progressive prize or the like.

Where the base game is a mechanical stepper game the modifiers as selected and applied may be displayed at a separate display or at an overlying transmissive video display.

The application of modifiers in addition to those described above may include functionalities such as making one or more base game symbols Wild such as an entire column or making all displayed base game symbols of a certain type Wild causing symbols to exchange their position in the matrix or enabling the player to select to make the exchange nudging symbols vertically or horizontally in the matrix to make a winning combination conferring the ability to hold a symbol or reel for one or subsequent plays automatically holding a symbol or reel for one or subsequent plays adding more free games in the event a free game feature is triggered accumulation of symbols toward a prize or feature or the like.

Where the base game is a video Poker Keno or other game modifiers can be selected an applied as well. For example for video Poker when triggered a multiplier modifier may be selected to multiply any winning outcome. Further a separate game such as a spinning reel game or a separate Stud Poker game could be provide through modifiers to the video Poker cards. For Keno a modifier could multiply an award provide a separate award trigger the draw of additional numbers provide a free play or the like.
