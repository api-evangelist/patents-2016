title: Switch device having a non-linear transmission line
abstract: Switching devices are provided. The switching devices include an input electrode, having a main electrode and a trigger electrode, and an output electrode. The main electrode and the trigger electrode are separated from the output electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap, respectively. During operation, the trigger electrode compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal causing the trigger electrode to emit a pulse of energy. This pulse of energy form plasma near the trigger electrode, either by arcing across the trigger gap, or by arcing from the trigger electrode to the main electrode. This plasma decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap. Simultaneously, or near simultaneously, a main voltage signal propagates through the main electrode. The main voltage signal emits a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap while the plasma formed by the trigger pulse is still present.

This invention was developed under Contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

A detonator is a device used to trigger an explosive device. Detonators can be chemically mechanically or electrically initiated. There are three categories of electrical detonators instantaneous electrical detonators IED short period delay detonators SPD and long period delay detonators LPD . Delays in SPDs are measured in milliseconds and delays in LPDs are measured in seconds. These conventional electrical detonators often use switches that activate using a surface breakdown. For example some conventional switches use a thin thick dielectric film between two electrodes that needs to be broken down by a high voltage. However these conventional switches often suffer from switch to switch jitter behavior. In some situations two switches operating at similar voltage amplitudes and with similar voltage pulse rise times can often have their dielectric gap breakdown occur with different timing. For example one switch can operate 100 ns after initial voltage application but a second switch can operate after 250 ns after the initial voltage application. This switch jitter behavior often results from variations of thickness of dielectric material of the dielectric gap which can result in variations of the time required for the voltage application to break through the dielectric gap.

Switching devices are provided. The switching devices include an input electrode having a main electrode and a trigger electrode and an output electrode. The main electrode and the trigger electrode are separated from the output electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap respectively. During operation the trigger electrode compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal causing the trigger electrode to emit a pulse of energy. This pulse of energy form plasma near the trigger electrode either by arcing across the trigger gap or by arcing from the trigger electrode to the main electrode. This plasma decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap. Simultaneously or near simultaneously a main voltage signal propagates through the main electrode. The main voltage signal emits a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap while the plasma formed by the trigger pulse is still present. Thereafter current flows from the main electrode through the arc to the output electrode to provide an output voltage signal.

A first exemplary switch device includes an input electrode and an output electrode. The input electrode includes a central electrode a main electrode electrically connected to the central electrode and a trigger electrode electrically connected to the central electrode The trigger electrode includes a non linear transmission line. In this first exemplary switch device a first part of the output electrode is separated from an end of the main electrode by a main gap and a second part of the output electrode is separated from an end of the trigger electrode by a trigger gap. The trigger gap and main gap are located such that arcing of a current across the trigger gap or between the main electrode and the trigger electrode decreases a breakdown voltage of the main gap.

A second exemplary switch device includes an input electrode and an output electrode. The input electrode includes a main electrode and a trigger electrode having a non linear transmission line. The output electrode is separated from the main electrode and the trigger electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap respectively. In this second exemplary switch device the non linear transmission line compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal to cause the trigger electrode to emit a trigger pulse of energy. The trigger pulse of energy creates plasma in or near the main gap such that a breakdown voltage of the main gap decreases. The main electrode propagates a main voltage signal to cause the main electrode to emit a main pulse of energy. The main pulse of energy creates assisted by the plasma created by the trigger pulse of energy an arc from the main gap to the output electrode.

A method for operating a switch device is also disclosed. The switch device includes an input electrode including a main electrode and a trigger electrode and an output electrode the output electrode being separated from the main electrode and the trigger electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap respectively. The method includes transmitting an input voltage signal to the input electrode wherein the input voltage signal creates a trigger voltage signal in the trigger electrode and a main voltage signal in the main electrode compressing and amplifying the trigger voltage signal in the trigger electrode to create a trigger pulse of energy that creates plasma in or near the main gap such that a breakdown voltage of the main gap decreases and propagating the main voltage signal along the main electrode to the main gap to create a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap to the output electrode while the breakdown voltage of the main gap is decreased.

The disclosure will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings like reference numbers generally indicate identical functionally similar and or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit s in the reference number.

In some embodiments switching devices are provided. The switching devices include an input electrode having a main electrode and a trigger electrode and an output electrode. The main electrode and the trigger electrode are separated from the output electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap respectively. During operation the trigger electrode compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal causing the trigger electrode to emit a pulse of energy. This pulse of energy form plasma near the trigger electrode either by arcing across the trigger gap or by arcing from the trigger electrode to the main electrode. This plasma decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap. Simultaneously or near simultaneously a main voltage signal propagates through the main electrode. The main voltage signal emits a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap while the plasma formed by the trigger pulse is still present. Thereafter current flows from the main electrode through the arc to the output electrode to provide an output voltage signal. Because the trigger electrode amplifies and compresses the trigger voltage signal the trigger pulse can reliably form a plasma based on an input voltage signal lower than would be possible in the absence of amplification. And the plasma formed by the trigger pulse allows the main pulse to arc based on an input voltage lower than would be possible in the absence of such plasma.

In some embodiments the main gap has a length of 2 microns to 1000 microns. In some embodiments the length of the main gap is not more than ten percent different than the length of the trigger gap . In most embodiments the ratio of the main gap to trigger gap is determined by the amplification factor designed with the nonlinear transmission line amplifier and if the main gaps are in air gas or embedded in a substrate.

Trigger electrode includes a non linear transmission line configured to compress and amplify a voltage pulse as it travels along the non linear transmission line. Any suitable structure may be used for the non linear transmission line. Non linear transmission lines are described in further detail below including the description of .

While input electrode and output electrode and other electrodes described herein are illustrated as having the shape of several rectangular prisms for ease of illustration any suitable electrode shape may be used.

The length of main gap is the shortest distance that separates main electrode from output electrode . Similarly the length of trigger gap is the shortest distance that separates trigger electrode from output electrode . End and first part are located at the ends of main gap . End and second part are located at the ends of trigger gap . As illustrated in an end of the main electrode represents a surface edge or point of the main electrode that is closest to the output electrode . As such end is in physical contact with main gap . Similarly an end of trigger electrode represents a surface edge or point of trigger electrode that is closest to output electrode . As such end is in physical contact with trigger gap . In some embodiments the length of main gap is about the same as the length of trigger gap . In some embodiments the length of main gap is not more than ten percent different from the length of trigger gap .

In the embodiment of main electrode extends from main gap in a first direction. Trigger electrode extends away from trigger gap in first direction i.e. in the same first direction parallel to main electrode . Main electrode extends away from main gap in a direction parallel to that of main gap . And trigger electrode extends away from trigger gap in a direction parallel to that of trigger gap . Trigger electrode is not disposed in the main gap.

In some embodiments a gas or a non conductive solid may be disposed in main gap and or trigger gap . Suitable non conductive solids and gasses are described in more detail below.

Substrate can be any suitable material. In one embodiment substrate is a ceramic such as AlO a polymer based dielectric material or silicon dioxide. Substrate may be or include other materials or combinations of materials such as sapphire or any other suitable material.

Because switch device is disposed on the surface of substrate main gap and trigger gap are filled with gas as illustrated in . Suitable gasses include noble gasses oxygen O carbon dioxide CO air nitrogen and mixtures thereof. Any other suitable gas may be used. In some embodiments the switch device can be situated within a package or housing that is filled with gas such that main gap and trigger gap are filled with the gas.

Switch device is embedded in substrate . In some embodiments as illustrated in main gap and trigger gap are through the substrate filled with a solid material of substrate . Substrate may be any suitable non conducting material such as silicon dioxide SiO biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate such as sold under the trade name Mylar polyimide such as sold under the trade name Kapton polystyrene polyurethane or parylene to provide some examples.

In some embodiments the one or more solid materials disposed in main gap and trigger gap can be removed and filled with a gas. The gas can include individual atoms for example a noble gas having molecules made from one type of atom for example oxygen O having compound molecules made from a variety of atoms for example carbon dioxide CO or having a mixture of individual atoms and or molecules to provide some examples.

While switch device is illustrated as entirely embedded in substrate other configurations may be used where switch device is only partially embedded. For example the surfaces of main electrode and output electrode closest to the surface of substrate may be exposed. A partially exposed structure may be easier to fabricate than a completely embedded structure. So long as main gap and trigger gap are entirely through the substrate and there is no alternate path between the relevant electrodes having a lower resistance than main gap and trigger gap switch device will still function in the same manner as an embedded switch.

Output electrode main electrode and trigger electrode of switch device are oriented differently than the corresponding parts of switch device . In the embodiment of main electrode extends from main gap in a first direction. Trigger electrode extends away from trigger gap in first direction i.e. in the same first direction parallel to main electrode . Main electrode extends away from main gap in a direction perpendicular to that of main gap . And trigger electrode extends away from trigger gap in a direction perpendicular to that of trigger gap .

Unlike the embodiments of end of trigger electrode is disposed in main gap . So the length of trigger gap is significantly less than the length of main gap . This placement allows plasma formed by a trigger pulse discharged by end to be disposed directly in main gap .

The switch devices described herein may be fabricated using any suitable process. By way of non limiting example photolithographic chemical machining coating and growing process steps may be used.

While various embodiments for different switch devices show specific locations and relative orientations for various gaps and electrodes any suitable combination of locations and relative orientations may be used that allow the switch device to function as described herein. For example various electrodes may be oriented relative to each other and may extend away from their corresponding gaps in a variety of ways.

A switch device according to various embodiments may electrically connected to any suitable source of input signal. A switch device may be fabricated or disposed on or in a substrate to form an integrated circuit.

In some embodiments the trigger electrode is configured and arranged to operate as a non linear transmission line that has a variable capacitance. Typically the non linear transmission line can be implemented using as nonlinear capacitors metal oxide materials known as varistors np junctions or diodes made of silicon carbide SiC gallium nitride GaN aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN also known as varactors or non linear ceramic materials but can include other materials or combinations of materials that will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art s without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments one or more of capacitors Cthrough Ccan be implemented using variable capacitors wherein the variable capacitors have capacitances that are a function of voltage on the variable capacitors. When multiple variable capacitors are connected in series as voltage on the nonlinear transmission line increases capacitance of the nonlinear transmission line can decrease.

In some embodiments a variable capacitor can be included as a lumped element in the nonlinear transmission line. In an example the variable capacitor can be formed by way of axially stacking such layers or radially stacking such layers. For instance when the layers are radially stacked the variable capacitor can include one or more concentric rings. The thicknesses of the one or more conductive layers are respectively selected such that the one or more conductive layers become conductive at particular voltages.

In some embodiments the nonlinear transmission line can include a nanoparticle modified complex dielectric material wherein distribution of conductive nanoparticles in the complex dielectric material corresponds with a capacitance that alters as a function of voltage. The dielectric constant of the nanoparticle modified complex dielectric material can be modified by leveraging the conductivity portion of a complex dielectric constant value which becomes frequency dependent thus introducing a strong nonlinear behavior and thereby inducing pulse compression . Accordingly a non conductive material can be manufactured to have conductive nanoparticles distributed therein in accordance with a predefined distribution.

The capacitance of the nonlinear transmission line can be represented as a function of voltage on the nonlinear transmission line. In some embodiments the capacitance C of the nonlinear transmission line can be represented as a function of voltage C on the nonlinear transmission line as denoted by 

At step the exemplary operational control flow transmits an input voltage signal to an input electrode of the switch device. The input voltage signal creates a trigger voltage signal in a trigger electrode of the switch device and a main voltage signal in a main electrode of the switch device. The input voltage signal can be a series of voltage pulses or repetitive voltage pulses ranging from a few Hertz Hz to many Megahertz MHz to provide an example.

At step the exemplary operational control flow compresses and amplifies the trigger voltage signal of step in the trigger electrode to create a trigger pulse of energy.

At step the trigger pulse arcs across the trigger gap or between the trigger electrode and the main electrode. The amplification of the trigger voltage signal assists with such arcing as arcing occurs at higher voltages. This arcing creates plasma in or near the main gap such that a breakdown voltage of the main gap decreases. The specific location of arcing from the trigger electrode is not particularly important so long as it creates plasma in or near the main gap. This plasma acts as a conductor and decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap.

In some embodiments the trigger gap and or the main gap include the solid material. In this exemplary embodiment the trigger pulse of energy effectively vaporizes namely changes a physical state from a solid to a gas the solid material of the trigger gap and or of the main gap when present by forming a plasma or plasma like material in or near the main gap.

This vaporization of the solid material is irreversible. As a result the switch device can be considered to be a single operation device. However if the main gap and or the trigger gap does not include the solid material and is filled with the gas as discussed above the switch device can be considered to be a multi operation or re usable device.

When the trigger pulse of energy exceeds a breakdown voltage of any gas present within the trigger gap a spark forms between the main electrode and the trigger electrode ionizing the gas of the trigger gap. Usually this ionizing of the gas of the trigger gap is violent and disruptive often leading to sound light and or heat.

At step the main voltage signal propagates along the main electrode to the main gap. This creates a main pulse of energy at the end of the main electrode.

At step the main pulse of energy arcs across the main gap to an output electrode of the switch device while the breakdown voltage of the main gap is decreased by plasma created by the trigger pulse.

Depending on the structure of the switch a solid material may be present in the main and or trigger gap before the switch is used. The trigger pulse of energy and the main pulse of energy vaporizes any solid material that may be present in the main gap when present and ionizes the gas of the main gap. Thereafter an electric main current flows via arcing between the main electrode and the output electrode using a pathway formed by the ionized gas of the main gap to provide an output voltage signal.

The non linear transmission line may amplify the trigger voltage signal by any suitable amount. In some embodiments the trigger voltage signal is amplified by at least a factor of 3 in the trigger electrode.
