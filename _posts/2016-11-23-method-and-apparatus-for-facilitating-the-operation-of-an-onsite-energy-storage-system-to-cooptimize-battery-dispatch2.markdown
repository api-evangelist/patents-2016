Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to facilitating the operation and control of a fleet of on site e.g. customer sited energy assets that may include energy storage systems renewable fuel or diesel generators gas turbines or the like and in particular to methods apparatus and computer program products for optimizing energy dispatch across this fleet to provide an energy provider e.g. a utility a system operator or a retail energy provider with firm capacity for example for purposes of resource adequacy other services or market products at specific market nodes and to reduce the electric costs for end customers with these controllable assets located on premises.

Conventional systems require electric transmission and distribution system operators and utilities to build infrastructure to support peak demand the costs of which are passed on to the customer for example via tariffs including demand response programs market based pricing and other time based pricing. While incentives may be offered to reduce demand during peak times customers are often not in a position to do so through conventional load reduction and load shifting measures and as such have instead attempted to employ the use of for example on site energy storage systems e.g. batteries or other energy assets. However the customer then bears the cost of having the on site energy storage system installed maintained and operated and furthermore bears the risk that the cost savings do not justify the expenditures. Moreover the utilities generally have no control over the deployment and operation of the on site energy storage systems deployed in the field and cannot rely on these resources like other traditional generators as firm capacity products for purposes such as resource adequacy.

The operational platform may be cloud based e.g. hosted on a cloud based virtual server . The operational platform may facilitate communications as demonstrated in the diagram below. To communicate with the distributed fleet the operational platform may utilize REST API methods or distributed queuing system e.g. publish subscribe method which the gateway devices may invoke at regular intervals e.g. 1 minute secured by mutual authentication mode transport layer security e.g. TLS .

Regardless of the type of device that embodies any of gateway devices A Nv or platform device any of gateway devices A N or platform device may include or be associated with an apparatus as shown in . In this regard the apparatus may include or otherwise be in communication with a processor a memory device a communication interface and a user interface . As such in some embodiments although devices or elements are shown as being in communication with each other hereinafter such devices or elements should be considered to be capable of being embodied within the same device or element and thus devices or elements shown in communication should be understood to alternatively be portions of the same device or element.

In some embodiments the processor and or co processors or any other processing circuitry assisting or otherwise associated with the processor may be in communication with the memory device via a bus for passing information among components of the apparatus. The memory device may include for example one or more volatile and or non volatile memories. In other words for example the memory device may be an electronic storage device e.g. a computer readable storage medium comprising gates configured to store data e.g. bits that may be retrievable by a machine e.g. a computing device like the processor . The memory device may be configured to store information data content applications instructions or the like for enabling the apparatus to carry out various functions in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. For example the memory device could be configured to buffer input data for processing by the processor. Additionally or alternatively the memory device could be configured to store instructions for execution by the processor.

As noted above the apparatus may be embodied by any of gateway devices A Nv or platform device configured to employ an example embodiment of the present invention. However in some embodiments the apparatus may be embodied as a chip or chip set. In other words the apparatus may comprise one or more physical packages e.g. chips including materials components and or wires on a structural assembly e.g. a baseboard . The structural assembly may provide physical strength conservation of size and or limitation of electrical interaction for component circuitry included thereon. The apparatus may therefore in some cases be configured to implement an embodiment of the present invention on a single chip or as a single system on a chip. As such in some cases a chip or chipset may constitute means for performing one or more operations for providing the functionalities described herein.

The processor may be embodied in a number of different ways. For example the processor may be embodied as one or more of various hardware processing means such as a coprocessor a microprocessor a controller a digital signal processor DSP a processing element with or without an accompanying DSP or various other processing circuitry including integrated circuits such as for example an ASIC application specific integrated circuit an FPGA field programmable gate array a microcontroller unit MCU a hardware accelerator a special purpose computer chip or the like. As such in some embodiments the processor may include one or more processing cores configured to perform independently. A multi core processor may enable multiprocessing within a single physical package. Additionally or alternatively the processor may include one or more processors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and or multithreading.

In an example embodiment the processor may be configured to execute instructions stored in the memory device or otherwise accessible to the processor. Alternatively or additionally the processor may be configured to execute hard coded functionality. As such whether configured by hardware or software methods or by a combination thereof the processor may represent an entity e.g. physically embodied in circuitry capable of performing operations according to an embodiment of the present invention while configured accordingly. Thus for example when the processor is embodied as an ASIC FPGA or the like the processor may be specifically configured hardware for conducting the operations described herein. Alternatively as another example when the processor is embodied as an executor of software instructions the instructions may specifically configure the processor to perform the algorithms and or operations described herein when the instructions are executed. However in some cases the processor may be a processor of a specific device configured to employ an embodiment of the present invention by further configuration of the processor by instructions for performing the algorithms and or operations described herein. The processor may include among other things a clock an arithmetic logic unit ALU and logic gates configured to support operation of the processor. In one embodiment the processor may also include user interface circuitry configured to control at least some functions of one or more elements of the user interface .

Meanwhile the communication interface may be any means such as a device or circuitry embodied in either hardware or a combination of hardware and software that is configured to receive and or transmit data between the any of user devices gateway devices A N platform device third party repositories or utility . In this regard the communication interface may include for example an antenna or multiple antennas and supporting hardware and or software for enabling communications wirelessly. Additionally or alternatively the communication interface may include the circuitry for interacting with the antenna s to cause transmission of signals via the antenna s or to handle receipt of signals received via the antenna s . For example the communications interface may be configured to communicate wirelessly such as via Wi Fi Bluetooth or other wireless communications techniques. In some instances the communication interface may alternatively or also support wired communication. As such for example the communication interface may include a communication modem and or other hardware software for supporting communication via cable digital subscriber line DSL universal serial bus USB or other mechanisms. For example the communication interface may be configured to communicate via wired communication with other components of the computing device.

The user interface may be in communication with the processor such as the user interface circuitry to receive an indication of a user input and or to provide an audible visual mechanical or other output to a user. As such the user interface may include for example a keyboard a mouse a joystick a display a touch screen display a microphone a speaker and or other input output mechanisms. In some embodiments a display may refer to display on a screen on a wall on glasses e.g. near eye display in the air etc. The user interface may also be in communication with the memory and or the communication interface such as via a bus.

The system may be configured to apply a portfolio optimization model for determining the battery configuration at a plurality of sites based on the site level electrical use profiles contract terms and applicable tariffs for each site under consideration. That is a particular site will have a particular electrical use profile from which a load curve may be predicted a particular contract under which the customer is engaged with one or more energy provider s and particular tariff rates or other cost structures provided by the energy provider s . The system may be configured to determine the battery configuration e.g. size and or type and the available cost savings and revenues. This process may also be used to inform utility contract proposals.

In a pre sales context the portfolio optimization model may be configured to run with a portfolio of one single site to determine the optimal system size for a given site in consideration of the individual site level electrical use profile contract terms and applicable tariff s for that site.

The operational platform predicts for example on a monthly basis a site level load curve and generates a schedule identifying a site level load plan the site level load plan indicating energy dispatch instructions optimizing use of the battery to maximize capacity or other product delivery to the energy provider and minimize customer energy costs based on relevant customer tariffs e.g. time of use demand charges and energy rates . Each site level optimized schedule may be generated in accordance with the predicted load curve the particular utility provider contract and the applicable tariff data of the site. A site level schedule is provided to a gateway device and the gateway device provides real time or near real time instructions to the third party provided local controller which controls the inverter and DC combiner panel.

In each context that the system is being used e.g. pre sales analysis or operations the system may be configured to optimally operate each site in accordance with multiple site constraints such as a no charge period i.e. charging of the battery is prohibited during a particular window and a non export rule i.e. battery power cannot be exported .

Where a customer has no on site generation the system may be configured to reduce battery use measured by for example a meter at the inverter as a site meter approaches 0 kW. As such battery power is never exported. Where the customer does have on site generation the system provides meters at site level at renewable energy generation level and at the inverter B such that S L G B i.e. the site load S is equal to the total load of the site L minus the generated renewable power G minus the battery power B where load L is a calculated value. The system may control battery use such that battery power is never exported if such is a constraint. This is done by ensuring B

The system may be configured such that each of the cloud based platform and the on site gateway device are configured to receive signals from the energy provider requesting energy dispatch. When dispatched by the energy provider through the cloud based platform the platform may determine through optimization how to dispatch the controllable assets within the portfolio of available sites or customer contracts which may comprise a plurality of sites . The system may determine a best fit when determining a load amount and a site selection for instructing a discrete dispatch event such that one or more on site gateway devices will receive instructions to override the site level schedule and increase battery usage thereby further reducing grid supplied electric consumption and reducing total distribution load of the energy provider. Further these dispatch signals for each on site energy storage unit will take into account the tariff considerations and site restrictions such that energy storage control will update scheduled thresholds and charging parameters in light of the expected battery energy capacity after the dispatch event. When dispatched by the energy provider through the gateway device logic on the device ensures that dispatch instructions are compatible with and secondary to platform based dispatch instructions.

The system may be configured to perform portfolio optimization which comprises identifying the best sites to earn the highest performance score possible for each dispatch signal from the utility with the battery and load resources that the system has available in its portfolio.

It should be noted that the optimization model is generic in nature and may be able to handle multi site portfolio optimization while accommodating any combination of assets and market products e.g. wholesale markets as well as utility programs. Thus the approach is able to provide stacked services to the distribution and transmission grids resulting in multiple and concurrent revenue streams. By co optimizing a portfolio of flexible loads storage and distributed generation assets to provide such grid services the AMS approach provides an economically sustainable business model that will facilitate the integration of renewable generation and storage assets resulting in greenhouse gases emissions improved power quality and resiliency.

In an example embodiment of the present invention a system apparatus or computer program product may be provided to implement or execute a method process or algorithm for generating and subsequently providing a site level schedule to a gateway apparatus for facilitating control of on site energy asset usage and grid supplied electric consumption.
