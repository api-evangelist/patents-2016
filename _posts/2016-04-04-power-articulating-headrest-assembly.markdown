This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application No. 14 315 443 filed on Jun. 26 2014 entitled POWER ARTICULATING HEADREST ASSEMBLY the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to a headrest for a vehicle and more particularly to a headrest with a knock down pivot for a vehicle.

It is common for front seating assemblies in vehicles to include a headrest assembly for supporting the head of a seated occupant. Generally these headrest assemblies are installed separately on a vehicle seat in a vehicle manufacturing facility after the vehicle seat has been installed in a vehicle interior. This is generally due to the fact that when assembled the vehicle seat in combination with the headrest assembly is too large to fit through the front driver s side or passenger s side doors. Further an assembled seat with headrest is often too large to ship as a unitary structure on a typical trailer storage shelf. Thus they are typically installed separately which incurs higher costs and a number of undesired installment executions. Further making electrical and structural connections between the vehicle seat and the headrest assembly is an assembly execution that is better performed when the vehicle seat is not installed in the vehicle. Further still known headrest assemblies may be limited to vertical adjustment relative to a seatback such that these headrest assemblies lack adequate adjustment features for different sized occupants and various positions a seated occupant may assume in the vehicle seat.

One aspect of the present invention includes a vehicle headrest assembly including a headrest member which is operably coupled to a seatback between upright and folded positions. A support assembly includes first and second linkages which are pivotally coupled to the headrest member and seatback at opposite ends thereof. First and second latch brackets are coupled to the first and second linkages respectively and are operable between latched and unlatched positions. The headrest member is moveable to the folded position from the upright position when the first and second latch brackets are in the unlatched position.

Another aspect of the present invention includes a vehicle headrest assembly having a support assembly defined by first and second linkages which are pivotally coupled to a headrest member between fore and aft positions. The headrest member is vertically adjustable. First and second latch brackets are coupled to the first and second linkages respectively and are operable between latched and unlatched positions. The headrest member is moveable to a folded position when the latch brackets are in the unlatched positions.

Yet another aspect of the present invention includes a vehicle headrest assembly having a headrest member coupled to a headrest bracket. A seatback includes a cross member with a first actuator member disposed thereon. A first linkage is pivotally coupled to the cross member at a first end and pivotally coupled to the headrest bracket at a second end. The first linkage includes a support arm extending outwardly therefrom. A first latch bracket is coupled to the first actuator at a lower end and further coupled to the support arm at an upper end. A second linkage is coupled to a second latch bracket at a first end and pivotally coupled to the headrest bracket at a second end. The second latch bracket is disposed on the cross member. The first and second linkages define a support assembly which is moveable between fore and aft positions as powered by the first actuator. The first and second latch brackets are operable between latched and unlatched positions wherein the headrest member is moveable to a folded position when the first and second latch brackets are in the unlatched position.

These and other aspects objects and features of the present invention will be understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art upon studying the following specification claims and appended drawings.

Referring now to the reference numeral generally designates a vehicle seat as positioned within a vehicle interior of a vehicle on a driver s side thereof. The vehicle seat includes a seatback pivotally coupled to a seat member . The seat member is slidably coupled to a vehicle floor along a track assembly . The track assembly is configured to allow the vehicle seat to be adjusted in forward and rearward directions along a path indicated by arrow A within the vehicle interior . It is understood that the vehicle seat may be positioned in various locations throughout the vehicle interior other than the illustrated position such as a passenger s side location a mid row location and a rear seat location. It is also conceivable that the seat member may not include a track assembly like track assembly and alternatively may be fixedly coupled to the vehicle floor .

Referring now to the seatback includes a lower portion and an upper portion . The upper portion of the seatback is coupled to a headrest assembly by a support assembly . The headrest assembly includes a headrest member shown in in a fully upright position U above the seatback which is vertically and horizontally adjustable along paths indicated by arrows V and H respectively. The headrest assembly is further configured to move the headrest member from the upright position U to a folded position F long a path indicated by arrow B as further described below with reference to .

Referring now to the support assembly of the headrest assembly extends upwardly from the upper portion of the seatback and curves slightly forward to couple with a headrest bracket of the headrest member as further described below. As shown the support assembly includes the trim piece that substantially encloses components of the support assembly as further described below. The trim piece extends from the headrest member to the upper portion b of the seatback . It is conceivable that the trim piece may include flexible components such as vinyl or leather structures to accommodate for relative movement of the headrest member and support assembly . As shown in the support assembly is pivotally coupled to a cross member disposed in the upper portion b of the seatback for structurally support the headrest assembly .

Referring now to the cross member is shown having first and second ends with a middle portion disposed therebetween. Support brackets are configured to couple to the cross member at the first and second ends respectively. The support brackets include upright connecting portions which are configured to receive a pivot bar which pivotally connects a linkage of the support assembly as further described below. An attachment bracket includes fasteners for coupling to the cross member at the middle portion . The attachment bracket is coupled to a first actuator which includes a drive shaft for driving the fore and aft positioning of the headrest member along a path as indicated by arrow H in . The first actuator is configured to drive the drive shaft in a vertical direction along a path as indicated by arrow C. A power connector is used to connect the first actuator to a power source for remote adjustment of the headrest assembly . As shown in a first latch bracket is configured to connect to the drive shaft of the first actuator for vertical movement therewith at threaded connector . The first latch bracket includes a body portion extending upwardly from threaded connector and also includes a slot disposed through the body portion . The slot is a generally curved slot or banana slot that is configured to guide movement of the support assembly as the headrest member moves from the upright position U to the folded position F along the path indicated by arrow B in . The first latch bracket further includes a latch member having a body portion with an engagement notch and a folded notch disposed thereon. Extending orthogonally from the body portion of the latch member a handle portion is disposed for engagement by a user to move the latch member between latched and unlatched positions L UL along a path as indicated by arrow D. The latch member is pivotally coupled to the body portion of the first latch bracket at attachment location . The latch member is further coupled to the body portion via a biasing mechanism which biases the latch member towards the latched position L.

As further shown in a second latch bracket is configured to couple to the second end of the cross member . The second latch bracket includes a connecting portion and an orthogonally upright extending body portion . In assembly the connecting portion is used to couple the second latch bracket to the cross member at second side . The body portion of the second latch bracket includes a slot disposed therethrough which is a curved slot or banana slot similar to slot described above in connection with the first latch bracket . A latch member is pivotally coupled to the second latch bracket and includes a body portion having an engagement notch and a handle portion . Thus the latch member is a reciprocal latch member to latch member described above in reference to the first latch bracket . The latch member is pivotally coupled to the body portion of the second latch bracket at attachment location . The latch member is configured to be engaged by a user at the handle portion for rotational movement between the latched position L and the unlatched position UL along the path as indicated by arrow D for moving the headrest member to the folded position F as shown in . The interaction between the first and second latch brackets for moving the headrest member to the folded position F is further described below with reference to .

Referring now to the folding movement of the headrest assembly is shown. Referring specifically to the headrest assembly is shown with the headrest member in the upright position U. The headrest member generally includes a front portion and a rear portion having a cushion material disposed therebetween as further described below. The support assembly generally includes first and second linkages which are pivotally coupled to the cross member and headrest member at opposite ends thereof. Specifically the first linkage includes an upper end and a lower end which are coupled to the headrest member and the cross member respectively. As described in more detail below the first linkage is coupled to the cross member at the lower end via a pivot bar and is further coupled to the headrest member at the upper end via a pivot bar that is coupled to a headrest bracket of the headrest member . Pivot bars respectively define fixed pivot locations P P. The first linkage further includes a body portion from which a support arm outwardly and downwardly extends. The support arm is latchingly engaged with first latch bracket via first fastener disposed through slot of the first latch bracket . The first fastener is retained in place by latch member at engagement notch when the latch member of the first latch bracket is in the latched position L. A trim attachment mount is also disposed on the body portion for coupling trim piece to the support assembly .

With regard to the second linkage shown in an upper end of the second linkage is pivotally coupled to the headrest bracket at connector bracket thereby defining pivot location P. The second linkage is further coupled to second latch bracket at a lower end . The second linkage is latchingly engaged with second latch bracket via second fastener disposed through slot and retained in engagement notch by latch member while the latch member of the second latch bracket is in the latched position L. As noted above and shown in the headrest assembly is configured to allow the headrest member to move from the upright position U to a folded position F along a path as indicated by arrow B. This folding action is made possible by moving the latch members of the first and second latch brackets from the latched position L shown in to the unlatched position UL shown in and further described below.

Referring now to the headrest assembly is shown with the headrest member being moved towards the folded position F along the path indicated by arrow B. In order to move the headrest member towards the folded position F from the upright position U the first and second latch brackets must be unlatched. A user unlatches the first and second latch brackets by engaging the handle portion of latch member and handle portion of latch member and moving the latch members towards the unlatched position UL along a path as indicated by arrow D. As shown in with specific reference to first latch bracket the latch member has been moved towards the unlatched position UL such that first fastener is no longer retained in engagement notch of latch member and has further moved upward along a length of slot of first latch bracket . Second latch bracket functions in a similar manner to release second fastener for movement along slot . In the unlatched position UL the first and second latch brackets allow for the headrest member to move towards the folded position F as shown in . It is contemplated that the headrest member may include a sufficient weight to gravitationally move towards the folded position F when the first and second latch brackets are unlatched. Unlatching the headrest assembly causes rotation about pivot location P where as described above first linkage couples to cross member at pivot bar . As further shown in and with specific reference to first latch bracket the biasing mechanism is in the form of a spring coupled to and disposed between the first latch bracket and the latch member which will bias the latch member towards the latched position L in assembly.

Referring now to the headrest assembly is shown in the fully folded position F relative to the cross member . As noted above the cross member is generally enclosed in a seatback such as seatback shown above in . Thus a user can unlatch the headrest assembly by accessing the first and second latch brackets from within the seatback . Thus the first and second latch brackets are not generally accessible to a user in common usage but can be accessed for folding the headrest assembly by a manufacturer for shipping storage or for installation in a vehicle interior such that headrest assembly does not have to be removed from the vehicle seat to accommodate confined door openings. As further shown in and with specific reference to first latch bracket the biasing mechanism has pulled the latch member towards the latched position L. The latch member includes a ramped portion which is configured to allow a user to move the headrest assembly to the full upright position U by simply pushing the headrest member along the path indicated by arrow B. Latch member of the second latch bracket is also configured in a similar manner such that a user need not engage either latch bracket when moving the headrest member towards the upright position U.

Referring now to the headrest member includes a cushion insert that further receives a rigid backing panel . The cushion insert be made of a foam material a resilient woven material or other flexible cushion materials and combinations thereof as generally understood by one having ordinary skill in the art. It is contemplated that the cushion insert may be an integrated part as shown or may be comprised of multiple parts have varying densities. The rigid backing panel is coupled to a support plate by a fastener . The support plate is configured to house a track assembly having a pair of parallel tracks as best shown in . The pair of parallel tracks slidably couple with upper and lower sliding elements of the track assembly that are fixedly coupled with headrest bracket . A second actuator includes a drive shaft that is coupled to the headrest member for vertical adjustment of the headrest member in a direction indicated by arrow V as further described below with reference to . The trim piece is shown in as having an upper housing a and a lower housing b which encase the support assembly in assembly. As further shown in a support member is shown exploded away from cross member which is coupled to cross member in assembly in the seatback for added strength and support.

Referring now to the embodiment shown in four separate sliding elements and are included having a generally T shaped cross section. However it is contemplated that more fewer and alternatively shaped sliding elements may be included in additional embodiments of the track assembly . Furthermore the track assembly may be alternatively configured with the tracks fixedly coupled with the headrest member and the sliding elements fixedly coupled with the backing panel of the cushion . In addition the track assembly may otherwise be integrated in additional embodiments with portions of the cushion such as the backing panel or portions of the headrest member .

Referring now to the headrest assembly is shown with the headrest member in a fully down position DN. As noted above the second actuator is configured to drive the headrest member to a full upright position UP as shown in along a path indicated by arrow V. As further shown in back casing conceals the track assembly and second actuator while the trim piece encloses the support assembly in assembly. With specific reference to the headrest member is in the full upright position UP as driven by the second actuator . It is contemplated that a covering may be used to conceal any gaps formed between the trim piece and back casing as the headrest member moves vertically along the path indicated by arrow V.

Referring now to the pivotal connection between the lower end of the first linkage and the cross member defines a first lateral axis at pivot location P. Further the pivotal connection between the upper end of the first linkage and the headrest bracket defines a second lateral axis at pivot location P. Similarly the second linkage has a pivotal connection to the connector bracket of the headrest bracket at an upper end which defines a third lateral axis at pivot location P. When the headrest assembly is in the latched position L the lower end of the second linkage defines a fourth lateral axis P at the pivotal connection of the lower end and the second latch bracket at second fastener . With the lateral axes P P the support assembly of the headrest assembly comprises a four bar linkage that pivots at the fixed pivot points P P to move the headrest member between fore and aft positions FR AF along a path indicated by arrow H. This movement is substantially horizontal to the user while the headrest member actually rotates forward and downward from the aft position AF to the fore position FR as shown in . Thus the support assembly defines a four bar linkage wherein the first linkage defines a primary linkage and the second linkage defines a secondary linkage. While both coupled to the headrest bracket lateral axes P and P are offset from one another wherein third lateral axis P is disposed above and rearward from the second lateral axis P. Similarly while both essentially coupled to the cross member lateral axes P and P are offset from one another wherein fourth lateral axis P is disposed below and rearward from the first lateral axis P. This configuration provides for a consistent angle of headrest member as headrest member moves between fore and aft positions FR AF along the path indicated by arrow H.

Demonstrating the relative movement of the headrest member between fore and aft positions FR AF along the path indicated by arrow H we must first look to wherein the headrest member is in both the full upright position U and the aft position AF. Referring now to the headrest member has moved forward towards the fore position FR to a partial forward position P that is approximately rotated 15 towards the fore position FR. As noted above the headrest member is driven along path H between the fore and aft positions FR AF by first actuator which is connected to the first latch bracket via the drive shaft at connection location . As shown in as compared to the drive shaft as powered by the first actuator has moved upward to a height H and thereby driven the first latch bracket upwards along the path C described above such that the headrest member has rotated forward to the partial forward position P. Thus when the headrest member is move towards the fore position FR the first latch bracket will be vertically offset relative to the second latch bracket as shown in .

Referring now to relative to the headrest the drive shaft as powered by the first actuator has moved upward to a height H and thereby driven the first latch bracket further upwards along the path C such that the headrest member has rotated further forward to the fully fore position FR which is approximately rotated 30 from the aft position AF. While the headrest member is moved along the path indicated by arrow H the angle of the headrest member is consistent between . Thus as adjusted vertically and horizontally the angle of the headrest member is maintained by cooperation between the lateral axes P P of the support assembly .

As noted above the headrest assembly is adjustable in many different directions to allow for comfort customization by the user. The headrest assembly is adjustable in that the headrest member can move between fore and aft positions FR AF along the path indicated by arrow H and can also move between the full upright position UP as shown in to the full down position DN shown in along the path indicated by arrow V. The first and second actuators drive the horizontal movement and vertical movement as described above. The horizontal movement and vertical movement of the headrest member is generally controlled by the user through remote electrical connections known in the art. As noted above with reference to the headrest member of the present invention can also move from the upright position U as shown in to the folded position F as shown in along the path indicated by arrow B. This adjustment between upright and folded positions U F is generally performed by the manufacturer for storage shipping and installation of the vehicle seat and headrest assembly in a vehicle. As noted above the folding of the headrest assembly allows the manufacture to store ship and install the vehicle seat in confined spaces without have to separate the headrest assembly from the vehicle seat . Thus a secure connection between the headrest assembly and the vehicle seat can be achieved and maintained from the assembly location to the installation location.

With specific regard to the movement of the headrest member it is contemplated that relative travel along the path V between full up position UP as shown in to the full down position DN as shown in may be about 55 mm in the vertical direction V. It is further contemplated that relative travel of the headrest member along the path H between the aft position AF as shown in to the fore position FR as shown in may be about 80 mm in the horizontal direction H. It is further contemplated that relative travel of the headrest member along the path B between upright position U as shown in to the folded position F as shown in may be about 91 mm in a generally horizontal direction and about 95 mm in a generally vertical direction. These travel dimensions are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that longer and shorter lengths of travel can be incorporated into the movement of the headrest member of the present invention without departing form the spirit of the invention.
