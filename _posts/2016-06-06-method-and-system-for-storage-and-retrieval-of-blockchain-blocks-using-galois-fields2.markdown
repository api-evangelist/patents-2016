This invention relates to retrieving electronic information over a computer network. More specifically it relates to a method and system for storage and retrieval of blockchains blocks using Galois Fields.

 Cloud computing is a term used to identify the delivery of computing requirements as a service to a heterogeneous community of end recipients. The term cloud theoretically signifies abstraction of technology resources and locations that are used in building an integrated computing infrastructure including networks systems applications etc. . All Cloud computing models rely heavily on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale similar to a utility like a grid for electricity over a network.

Cloud computing provides services with a user s data software and computation on over multiple networks. End users access cloud based applications through a web browser or a light weight desktop or mobile application while the rest of the application software and data are stored on servers at remote locations. Cloud computing provides a same or better service and performance with cloud software programs as if al the cloud software programs were actually installed locally on end user devices.

At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of infrastructure convergence and shared services. This type of cloud computing environment allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster with easier manageability and less maintenance and enables the enterprise to more rapidly adjust resources such as servers storage and networking to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand.

 Peer to peer P2P computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer to peer network of nodes.

Peers make a portion of their resources such as processing power disk storage or network bandwidth directly available to other network participants without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources in contrast to the traditional client server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.

Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers yet that are beneficial to all the peers.

A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as completed blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear chronological order. Blockchains are used on P2P networks and other networks. Each P2P node gets a copy of the blockchain which gets downloaded automatically upon joining P2P. The blockchain has complete information about the block owners and block content right from the first block to the most recently completed block.

The blockchain is seen as the main technical innovation of the cryptocurrency BITCOIN where it serves as a public ledger of all BITCOIN transactions. BITCOIN is P2P every user is allowed to connect to the network send new transactions to it verify transactions and create new blocks which is why it is called permissionless. 

However there are a number of problems associated with electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing network.

Another problem is providing proper privacy and security for electronic content stored and retrieved on cloud computing networks.

Another problem is information entropy including information gain and mutual information of information stored on cloud computing networks.

Another problem is storing plaintext on a cloud computing networks without encrypting the plaintext and providing various levels of security and privacy for the plaintext.

Another problem is how and where blockchains can be safely and securely stored and retrieved on a communications network.

Thus it is desirable to solve some of the problems associated with content storage and retrieval with cloud computing networks.

In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention some of the problems associated with electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing networks are overcome. A method and system for storage and retrieval block chains using Galois Fields is presented.

One or more blocks for a blockchain are securely stored and retrieved with a modified Galois Fields on a cloud or peer to peer P2P communications network. The modified Galois Field provides at least additional layers for security and privacy for blockchains.

4G and 5G technologies are a successor to 3G and 2G standards. The nomenclature of the generations generally refers to a change in the fundamental nature of the service. The first was the move from analogue 1G to digital 2G transmission. This was followed by multi media support spread spectrum transmission and at least 200 kbits second 3G . The 4G NICs include IP packet switched NICs wired and wireless ultra broadband i.e. gigabit speed access NICs Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX NICs WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE and or multicarrier transmission NICs.

A WPAN interconnects all the ordinary computing and communicating devices that a person has on their desk e.g. computer etc. or carry with them e.g. PDA mobile phone smart phone table computer two way pager etc. 

A key concept in WPAN technology is known as plugging in. In the ideal scenario when any two WPAN equipped devices come into close proximity within several meters and or feet of each other or within a few miles and or kilometers of a central server not illustrated they can communicate via wireless communications as if connected by a cable. WPAN devices can also lock out other devices selectively preventing needless interference or unauthorized access to secure information. Zigbee is one wireless protocol used on WPAN networks such as cloud communications network .

Present applications include contactless transactions data exchange and simplified setup of more complex communications such as Wi Fi. Communication is also possible between an NFC device and an unpowered NFC chip called a tag including radio frequency identifier RFID tags and or sensor.

NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats and are based on existing radio frequency identification RFID standards including ISO IEC 14443 and FeliCa. These standards include ISO IEC 1809 and those defined by the NFC Forum all of which are incorporated by reference.

An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product animal or person for the purpose of identification and or tracking using RF signals.

An RFID sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into an RF signal which can be read by an observer or by an instrument e.g. target network devices server network devices etc. 

 Machine to machine M2M refers to technologies that allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same ability. M2M uses a device to capture an event such as option purchase etc. which is relayed through a network wireless wired cloud etc. to an application software program that translates the captured event into meaningful information. Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.

However modern M2M communication has expanded beyond a one to one connection and changed into a system of networks that transmits data many to one and many to many to plural different types of devices and appliances. The expansion of IP networks across the world has made it far easier for M2M communication to take place and has lessened the amount of power and time necessary for information to be communicated between machines.

Application programs include security and or encryption application programs integral to and or separate from the cloud applications Security and or encryption programs may also exist in hardware components on the network devices described herein and or exist in a combination of hardware software and or firmware.

Wireless Encryption Protocol WEP also called Wired Equivalent Privacy is a security protocol for WiLANs defined in the IEEE 802.11b standard. WEP is cryptographic privacy algorithm based on the Rivest Cipher 4 RC4 encryption engine used to provide confidentiality for 802.11b wireless data.

RC4 is cipher designed by RSA Data Security Inc. of Bedford Mass. which can accept encryption keys of arbitrary length and is essentially a pseudo random number generator with an output of the generator being XORed with a data stream to produce encrypted data.

One problem with WEP is that it is used at the two lowest layers of the OSI model the physical layer and the data link layer therefore it does not offer end to end security. One another problem with WEP is that its encryption keys are static rather than dynamic. To update WEP encryption keys an individual has to manually update a WEP key. WEP also typically uses 40 bit static keys for encryption and thus provides weak encryption making a WEP device a target of hackers.

The IEEE 802.11 Working Group is working on a security upgrade for the 802.11 standard called 802.11i. This supplemental draft standard is intended to improve WiLAN security. It describes the encrypted transmission of data between systems 802.11X WiLANs. It also defines new encryption key protocols including the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol TKIP . The IEEE 802.11i draft standard version 4 completed Jun. 6 2003 is incorporated herein by reference.

The 802.11i is based on 802.1x port based authentication for user and device authentication. The 802.11i standard includes two main developments Wi Fi Protected Access WPA and Robust Security Network RSN .

WPA uses the same RC4 underlying encryption algorithm as WEP. However WPA uses TKIP to improve security of keys used with WEP. WPA keys are derived and rotated more often than WEP keys and thus provide additional security. WPA also adds a message integrity check function to prevent packet forgeries.

RSN uses dynamic negotiation of authentication and selectable encryption algorithms between wireless access points and wireless devices. The authentication schemes proposed in the draft standard include Extensible Authentication Protocol EAP . One proposed encryption algorithm is an Advanced Encryption Standard AES encryption algorithm.

Dynamic negotiation of authentication and encryption algorithms lets RSN evolve with the state of the art in security adding algorithms to address new threats and continuing to provide the security necessary to protect information that WiLANs carry.

The NIST developed a new encryption standard the Advanced Encryption Standard AES to keep government information secure. AES is intended to be a stronger more efficient successor to Triple Data Encryption Standard 3DES a public private key encryption system.

DES is a popular symmetric key encryption method developed in 1975 and standardized by ANSI in 1981 as ANSI X.3.92 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. As is known in the art 3DES is the encrypt decrypt encrypt EDE mode of the DES cipher algorithm. 3DES is defined in the ANSI standard ANSI X9.52 1998 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. DES modes of operation are used in conjunction with the NIST Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS for data encryption FIPS 46 3 October 1999 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The NIST approved a FIPS for the AES FIPS 197. This standard specified Rijndael encryption as a FIPS approved symmetric encryption algorithm that may be used by U.S. Government organizations and others to protect sensitive information. The NIST FIPS 197 standard AES FIPS PUB 197 November 2001 is incorporated herein by reference.

The NIST approved a FIPS for U.S. Federal Government requirements for information technology products for sensitive but unclassified SBU communications. The NIST FIPS Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules FIPS PUB 140 2 May 2001 is incorporated herein by reference.

RSA is a public private key encryption system which can be used both for encrypting messages and making digital signatures. The letters RSA stand for the names of the inventors Rivest Shamir and Adleman. For more information on RSA see U.S. Pat. No. 4 405 829 now expired incorporated herein by reference.

 Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed length value or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms.

Secure Hash Algorithm SHA is used for computing a secure condensed representation of a data message or a data file. When a message of any length 

Message Digest 5 MD 5 takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128 bit message digest of the input. The MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications where a large file must be compressed in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private secret key under a public key cryptosystem such as RSA. The IETF RFC 1321 entitled The MD5 Message Digest Algorithm is incorporated here by reference.

Providing a way to check the integrity of information transmitted over or stored in an unreliable medium such as a wireless network is a prime necessity in the world of open computing and communications. Mechanisms that provide such integrity check based on a secret key are called message authentication codes MAC . Typically message authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret key in order to validate information transmitted between these parties.

Keyed Hashing for Message Authentication Codes HMAC is a mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions. HMAC is used with any iterative cryptographic hash function e.g. MD5 SHA 1 SHA 256 SHA 512 etc. in combination with a secret shared key. The cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the properties of the underlying hash function. The IETF RFC 2101 entitled HMAC Keyed Hashing for Message Authentication is incorporated here by reference.

An Electronic Code Book ECB is a mode of operation for a block cipher with the characteristic that each possible block of plaintext has a defined corresponding cipher text value and vice versa. In other words the same plaintext value will always result in the same cipher text value. Electronic Code Book is used when a volume of plaintext is separated into several blocks of data each of which is then encrypted independently of other blocks. The Electronic Code Book has the ability to support a separate encryption key for each block type.

Diffie and Hellman DH describe several different group methods for two parties to agree upon a shared secret in such a way that the secret will be unavailable to eavesdroppers. This secret is then converted into various types of cryptographic keys. A large number of the variants of the DH method exist including ANSI X9.42. The IETF RFC 2631 entitled Diffie Hellman Key Agreement Method is incorporated here by reference.

The HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP Secure HTTPs is a standard for encrypted communications on the World Wide Web. HTTPs is actually just HTTP over a Secure Sockets Layer SSL . For more information on HTTP see IETF RFC 2616 incorporated herein by reference.

The SSL protocol is a protocol layer which may be placed between a reliable connection oriented network layer protocol e.g. TCP IP and the application protocol layer e.g. HTTP . SSL provides for secure communication between a source and destination by allowing mutual authentication the use of digital signatures for integrity and encryption for privacy.

The SSL protocol is designed to support a range of choices for specific security methods used for cryptography message digests and digital signatures. The security method are negotiated between the source and destination at the start of establishing a protocol session. The SSL 2.0 protocol specification by Kipp E. B. Hickman 1995 is incorporated herein by reference. More information on SSL is available at the domain name See netscape.com eng security SSL 2.html. 

Transport Layer Security TLS provides communications privacy over the Interet. The protocol allows client server applications to communicate over a transport layer e.g. TCP in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping tampering or message forgery. For more information on TLS see IETF RFC 2246 incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the security functionality includes Cisco Compatible EXtensions CCX . CCX includes security specifications for makers of 802.11xx wireless LAN chips for ensuring compliance with Cisco s proprietary wireless security LAN protocols. As is known in the art Cisco Systems Inc. of San Jose Calif. is supplier of networking hardware and software including router and security products.

 Integrated Encryption Scheme IES is a hybrid encryption scheme which provides semantic security against an adversary who is allowed to use chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks. The security of the scheme is based on the Diffie Hellman problem. Two incarnations of the IES are standardized Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme DLIES and Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme ECIES which is also known as the Elliptic Curve Augmented Encryption Scheme or simply the Elliptic Curve Encryption Scheme. For more information see SEC 1 Elliptic Curve Cryptography Version 2.0 May 21 2009 the contents of which are incorporated by reference.

 Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption where a specific algebraic operation performed on the plaintext is equivalent to another possibly different algebraic operation performed on the ciphertext. Homomorphic encryption schemes are malleable by design. The homomorphic property of various cryptosystems is used with cloud computing by ensuring the confidentiality of processed data. The homomorphic part of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme can also be described in terms of category theory. If C is the category whose objects are integers i.e. finite streams of data and whose morphisms are computable functions then ideally a fully homomorphic encryption scheme elevates an encryption function to a function from C to itself.

A one time pad OTP is a type of encryption which has been proven to be impossible to crack if used correctly. Each bit or character from the plaintext is encrypted by a modular addition with a bit or character from a secret random key or pad of the same length as the plaintext resulting in a ciphertext. If the key is truly random as large as or greater than the plaintext never reused in whole or part and kept secret the ciphertext will likely be impossible to decrypt or break without knowing the key.

However the present invention is not limited to such security and encryption methods described herein and more fewer and or other types of security and encryption methods can be used to practice the invention. The security and encryption methods described herein can also be used in various combinations and or in different layers of the protocol stack with each other.

An API is a particular set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. It serves as an interface between different software programs and facilitates their interaction.

A barcode is an optical machine readable representation of data which shows data about the object to which it attaches. Originally barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines and may be referred to as linear or 1 dimensional 1D . Later they evolved into rectangles dots hexagons and other geometric patterns in 2 dimensions 2D . Although 2D systems use a variety of symbols they are generally referred to as barcodes as well. Barcodes originally were scanned by special optical scanners called barcode readers scanners and interpretive software are available on devices including desktop printers not illustrated and smart phones and tablet computers .

Table 5 illustrates exemplary matrix 2D barcodes the standards of all of which are incorporated by reference. However the present invention is not limited to the exemplary matrix barcodes listed in Table 5 and more fewer and other matrix barcodes can also be used to practice the invention.

In one specific embodiment the cloud application interacts with a bar code reader application. However the present invention is not limited to a bar code reader application and other applications can also be used to practice the invention.

In one specific exemplary embodiment a QR bar code is used. However the present invention is not limited to QR codes and other types of bar codes can also be used to practice the invention.

A QR Code is a specific matrix barcode or two dimensional code readable by dedicated QR barcode readers and camera phones. The code consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The information encoded can be text URL or other data.

A field is an algebraic object with at least two operations addition and multiplication. However fields do not use ordinary math addition and multiplication. With field addition all the elements of the field must form a commutative group with identity denoted by zero and the inverse of a field element f denoted by f. For field multiplication all the elements of the field except zero must form another commutative group with identity denoted by one and inverse of f denoted by f. The element zero has no inverse under field multiplication. The distributive identity must also satisfy a b c a b a c for all field elements a b and c.

In one embodiment finite Galois fields are used. For any prime integer p and any integer n greater than or equal to one there is at one unique field with pelements in it denoted GF p . In the case n is equal to one the Galois field is just the integers mod p in which field addition and field multiplication are just the ordinary math versions followed by taking the remainder on division by p.

The modulo operation determines a remainder of a division of one number by another. Given two positive numbers a i.e. the dividend and n i.e. the divisor a modulo n i.e. a mod n is a remainder of a division of a by n.

In one embodiment p 2 and n 8 so GF 2 an 8 bit representation of numbers is used. This field allows decimal numbers in the range from zero to 255 since 2 256. Elements of GF p are represented as polynomials of degree strictly less than n over GF p . A polynomial is an expression of finite length constructed from variables and constants and non negative integer exponents e.g. x x x 1 etc. . GF 2 is used because 2is an even power of 2 and 8 is the number of bits in a byte a term used a common unit of storage in a computer readable medium. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other values of p and n can be used to create Galois fields and to practice the invention e.g. GF 3 etc. 

When the p is the prime integer 2 elements of GF p are expressed as binary numbers with each term in a polynomial represented by one bit in the corresponding element s binary expression. This can be represented as a polynomial b x with binary coefficients b 0 1 as bx bx bx bx bx bx bx b0. For example the following are equivalent representations of the same value in a characteristic 2 finite Galois field Polynomial x x x 1 is equal to Binary 01010011 . Since GF 2 there is no x so a zero is placed in the binary there is an x so a one is placed in the binary there is no x so a zero is placed in the binary there is an x so a one is placed in the binary etc.

The difficult part of a Galois field is finding the multiplicative inverse of an element that is given a non zero element a in Z finding a. This is the same as finding b such that a b p 1 wherein is the modulus operator.

Since multiplicative inverses of Galois fields are hard to find they are often are used in encryption methods e.g. versions of AES etc. . Galois fields are used in the present invention in part to make it difficult to determine locations of portions of electronic content or a whole portion is distributed to server network device address locations determined using Galois fields.

In at Step the determined plural address locations are securely stored in a cloud content location map with the first cloud application in the first non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device. At Step the plural cloud storage objects are securely sent to the determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers on the cloud communications network. The plural cloud storage objects are distributed and located in plural different locations on the cloud communications network. None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices can individually determine locations of all portions of the received electronic content on the cloud communications network thereby providing a first layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network.

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment in at Step electronic content is received on a first cloud application and stored in a first non transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device e.g. etc. with the one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising one or more public communication networks one or more private networks one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks .

At Step the received electronic content e.g. etc. is split with the first cloud application into plural portions e.g. etc. .

At Step the first cloud application saves the plural portions in plural cloud storage objects . In one embodiment one or more QR codes are added to the plural cloud storage objects to uniquely identify a whole portion or uniquely identify the plural portions of the desired electronic content. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other identifiers can be used to uniquely identify electronic content .

At Step plural address locations of selected ones of plural of other different cloud server network devices each with one or more processors are determined with a Galois field. An input to the Galois field produces an output including an address location of a desired cloud server on the cloud communications network. The address location can be located anywhere on the one or more public communication networks one or more private networks one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks of the cloud communications network .

For example the Galois field produces the output by completing one or more field operations including field addition field multiplication and field modulus operations on the input to the Galois field as was described above. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other field operations can be used on the Galois field to practice the invention.

In one embodiment the Galois field is represented as a set of plural software instructions in the non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device and is assessable via and used by the first cloud application .

In another embodiment the Galois field is implemented in hardware or firmware on the cloud server network device or a combination of software hardware and or firmware.

In one embodiment p 2 and n 8 so GF 2 . However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other values can be used for p and n in GF p .

In one embodiment two exemplary polynomials are included in the Galois field GF 2 . The choice of polynomials have no effect on field addition operations on the Galois field. However the choice of polynomials is relevant for the field operation of multiplication and provides a modulus for field multiplication operations.

In one embodiment two exemplary polynomials include but are not limited to p x x x x 1 and p x x 1. The two polynomials are field multiplied together using input data for x. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment more fewer and other polynomials can be used to practice the invention.

Since Galois fields are very complicated a simple example using the Galois Field GF 2 and the polynomial P x x x 1 is provided to illustrate the invention. The GF 2 and p x x x x 1 and p x x 1 are very complicated and include several hundred entries but are determined in a similar manner to the simple example illustrated in Table 6. .

The simple exemplary GF 2 GF 8 since two raised to the third power is eight. A result from the Galois field GF 2 is 1011 binary is equal to the number 11 decimal . Values in GF 2 are 3 bits each spanning the decimal number range zero through seven. Galois field multiplication takes place on 3 bit binary values with modulo two addition where the two and three are from 2 and the result is computed modulo P x so the result is 1011 binary which is equal to the number 11 decimal .

Table 6 illustrates exemplary Galois field multiplication and Galois field addition tables used for a very simple Galois Field GF 2 with the polynomial P x x x 1. The results are listed in decimal number format. Similar tables are used to Galois field multiply input values GF 2 for p x x x x 1 and p x x 1 to increase output speed for the Galois field operations .

For example Table 6 with Galois Field GF 2 and P x x x 1 and be used to verify the Galois field multiplication of 5 4 as is illustrated in Equation 1 . Multiplication takes place on 3 bit binary values with modulo 2 addition. As Table 6 illustrates the element zero has no inverse and is not used under Galois field multiplication. 5 decimal 4 decimal 101 binary 100 binary 10100 1 The results is then computed modulo P x as is illustrated in Equation 2 since the Galois field GF 2 is 1011 binary or 11 decimal . 10100 binary mod 1011 binary 010 binary 2 decimal 2 

As another example the Galois field multiplication of 4 3 4 decimal 3 decimal 100 binary 011 binary 1100 binary. Then 1100 binary mod 1011 binary 111 binary 7 decimal .

In this simple example Galois field addition takes places on 3 bit binary values using bitwise exclusive OR XOR operations. A bitwise XOR operation takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs a logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is one if only the first bit is one or only the second bit is one but will be zero if both bits are zero or both bits are one. In the comparison of two bits if the two bits are different the XOR result is a one and the XOR result is a zero if they are the same.

Table 6 can be also used to verify the Galois field GF 2 addition of 5 4 101 XOR 100 001 1 decimal . Note however as was discussed above the choice of the polynomial P x plays no role in the Galois Field addition operation.

For additional security and privacy the values for p and n and the two or more polynomials are periodically changed in the Galois field. The corresponding instructions and tables etc. are replaced in the non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device . In such an embodiment new tables of Galois Field output numbers are calculated and stored in the computer readable medium on the cloud server network device .

In one embodiment field multiplication in GF 2 includes multiplying data for the two polynomials modulo using an irreducible polynomial of degree eight e.g. p x x x x x 1 etc. . Such an irreducible polynomial provides an additional level of security for use of the Galois field. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other polynomials can be used to practice the invention.

In one embodiment the input is to the Galois field is a sequence of binary digits i.e. ones and zeros obtained from two or more random numbers from a random number generator accessible by the first cloud application e.g. if the decimal number 176 is obtained from the random number generator then binary number 10110000 since 176 decimal is equal to 10110000 binary is input to the Galois field etc. . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other types of inputs can be used as inputs to the Galois field including pre determined sequences of numbers prime numbers digitized user encoded biometrics tables of selected numbers etc.

 Biometrics are patterns derived from physical features e.g. fingerprints iris patterns scanned from an eye facial scan patterns etc or emissions e.g. voice patterns DNA samples hair samples blood samples etc of a human body.

In one embodiment the biometric information is included in binary bit patterns and run through a encryption method e.g. AES DES MD5 etc. . Biometric encryption methods securely bind a digital key to a biometric or extract a key from the biometric. Neither the key nor the biometric can be retrieved from a stored biometric template. The key is re created only if a correct biometric sample is presented on verification. An output of biometric encryption is verification that either a key is correct or incorrect.

In one embodiment the input to the Galois field produces an output including a virtual cloud communication network addresses an Internet Protocol IP address and or a Medium Access Control MAC address and or a TCP and or a UDP and or other protocol port designation and or combinations thereof. However the present invention is not limited to such address location and other address locations can be used to practice the invention.

In one embodiment the virtual cloud communication network addresses include virtual addresses of cloud server network devices located anywhere on the cloud communications network . However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention. In such an embodiment the virtual cloud communication network addresses include for example virtual designations for example as cloud server 1 private network 1 cloud server 2 public network 3 etc. e.g. Table 7 8 etc. However the present invention is not limited to such notation and other notation can be used to practice the invention.

Table 7 illustrates exemplary address locations for plural cloud server network devices on the plural networks on the cloud network based on the field multiplication values from the Galois Filed outputs of Table 6. Address locations are illustrated with exemplary virtual addresses IP addresses MAC data link addresses and UDP port addresses and combinations therefore for cloud server network devices for simplicity. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

The address location column of Table 7 is periodically changed to provide additional security and privacy. Individual address locations from a list of address locations of cloud server network devices are selected using a random number generator. The output from the random number generator is used to add the individual address locations into a row and column in Table 7. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In one embodiment the output from the Galois field includes a number which is used to reference a location in an address location table e.g. Table 7 etc. . However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments including or not including tables can be used to practice the invention.

In another embodiment another input used for the Galois field is physical location information of the target network device .

In one embodiment the physical location information includes Global Positioning System GPS information street address information two dimensional 2D geo space e.g. X Y e.g. building floor three dimensional 3D X Y Z e.g. building floor floor location e.g. room office desk etc. or other physical location information e.g. longitude latitude street address etc. . However the present invention is not limited to such physical location information and other physical location information can be used to practice the invention.

The Global Positioning System GPS is a space based global navigation satellite system GNSS that provides reliable location and time information in all weather and at all times and anywhere on or near the Earth. A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing signals sent by GPS satellites. A GPS receiver uses the messages it receives to determine a transit time of each message and computes a distance to each GPS satellite. These distances along with the satellites locations are used with the possible aid of triangulation depending on which algorithm is used to compute a current physical position of the GPS receiver. This position is then displayed perhaps with a moving map display e.g. at a street level etc. and or latitude and longitude and or elevation and or speed and or acceleration information may also be included. Many GPS units also show derived information such as travel direction and speed calculated from position changes. The GPS coordinates include standard GPS GPS map Digital GPS DGPS and or other types of GPS information.

In such embodiments the output from the Galois field includes address locations of selected ones of the plural of other cloud server network devices that are physically closest to the target network device requesting the desired electronic content. In such an embodiment the desired electronic content is delivered faster to the target network device the servers used to store portions of the desired electronic content are physically close to the target network device . One reason faster delivery can occur is that a wireless and or wired communication is faster when a communications is stronger. Stronger signals occur when a network device is closer to a signal source. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

The various embodiments have been described with Galois fields using decimal numbers. However decimal number were only used to make it easier for person skilled in the art to understand the invention. In an actual implementation of the invention on a cloud computing network one or more processors on the cloud target network device executes the cloud application and the methods described herein as a series of instructions in a non transitory computer readable medium. Therefore the Galois filed would directly use binary representations for all inputs and outputs of the Galois field and conversions to and from decimal numbers would not be necessary as the inputs and outputs need not be in human readable form for the one or more processors.

Galois fields are also used because operations used on the Galois fields are native to network device processors and internal hardware such as shift left for multiplication shift right for division logical AND OR XOR etc. Galois fields can be implemented in hardware as a series of logic gates.

Returning to at Step the determined plural address locations are securely stored in a cloud content location map with the first cloud application in the first non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device . In another embodiment the cloud content location map is stored in a secure database associated with the cloud server network device . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and types of storage can be used to store the cloud content location map.

In another embodiment Method is used without splitting the received electronic content into plural portions. In such an embodiment a whole portion of the received electronic content is copied by the first cloud application into a single cloud storage object . The Galois filed is used to determine an address location of a single cloud server network device on the networks that comprise the cloud network . The single cloud storage object is sent to the address location of that cloud network server device. When the desired electronic content is requested the whole portion of the electronic content is returned and removed from the cloud storage object and sent to the target network device .

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment in at Step a first request message is received in real time on the first cloud application stored in the first non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device with the one or more processors from a second cloud application stored in a second non transitory computer readable medium on a target network device e.g. etc. with one or more processors via the cloud communications network .

The first request message includes a request for desired cloud electronic content stored in the plural cloud storage objects stored on the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices located on one or more of the networks comprising the cloud communications network . The plural different cloud storage objects function as a single transparent secure storage object for electronic content on the cloud communications network .

In this embodiment real time includes a time period of a few seconds e.g. one to five seconds etc. or less in elapsed time. That is from a first time a request message is received until the desired electronic content is delivered a few seconds of actual time elapse. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other time periods for real time can be used to practice the invention.

In one embodiment the first request message includes a QR bar code .

In another embodiment the first request message includes login information for one or more television sites social networking sites music distribution sites. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

At Step the cloud content location map is retrieved securely on the first cloud application on the cloud server network device . The cloud content location map includes location addresses of the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices on the cloud communications network .

In at Step first cloud application on the cloud server network device sends plural second request messages for the desired cloud electronic content to the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices identified in the retrieved cloud content location map and located on the one or more public communication networks the one or more private networks community networks and hybrid networks comprising the cloud communications network .

At Step the cloud computing application on the server network device receives plural response messages including one or more individual portions of the desired cloud electronic content in one or more of cloud storage objects from the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices on the public communication networks the one or more private networks community networks and hybrid networks comprising the cloud communications network .

At Step the first cloud application on the first server network device combines the one or more individual components of the desired cloud electronic content from the one or more cloud storage objects from the received plural response messages into a final desired electronic cloud content component .

In at Step the first cloud application on the cloud server network device securely sends in real time the final desired cloud electronic content component as the desired cloud electronic content to the target network device via the cloud communications network .

The second cloud application on the target network device cannot determine the desired cloud electronic content was stored as plural portions in plural cloud storage objects and cannot determine which of plural selected ones of the other different cloud server network devices on the one or more public private community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network may have stored portions of the final desired cloud electronic content thereby providing a second layer of security and privacy for the desired cloud electronic content on the cloud communications network .

In another embodiment as was described above a whole portion of the desired cloud electronic content can be requested by the target network device and returned to the target network device from the cloud server network device after the desired cloud electronic is retrieved as a whole portion stored in from another cloud server network device on one or the networks of the cloud network .

The desired cloud electronic content can be requested from the cloud communications network and displayed by the second cloud application on the target network device anywhere the target network device is physically located near and or in communications with any server network devices on any of the networks on the cloud communications network .

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

At Step the first cloud application on the cloud server network device sends plural third request messages to the selected ones of the plural of other different cloud server network devices identified in the retrieved cloud content location map to de activate the plural portions of desired cloud electronic content stored in the plural cloud storage objects stored on the selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices .

De activating the plural portions of the desired cloud electronic content stored in the plural cloud storage objects includes encrypting the plural cloud storage objects or deleting the plural cloud storage objects .

If the plural cloud storage objects are encrypted they can be decrypted at a later time for retrieval. If the plural storage objects are deleted then they cannot be retrieved from the same server network devices without re storing the plural cloud storage objects . However the present invention is not limited to such embodiments other can be used to practice the invention.

In one embodiment if the plural cloud storage objects are encrypted e.g. with a public or private encryption key for AES DES RSN DLIES ECIES etc. when subsequent requests for the desired electronic content are made by the target network device one or more of the encrypted plural cloud storage objects on cloud server network devices that are closest to a physical location of the target network device are decrypted e.g. with a corresponding public or private decryption key etc. and sent to the cloud network server for processing.

This increases the efficiency and speed of electronic content delivery on the cloud communications network . In such an embodiment the plural cloud storage objects are duplicated and distributed in plural different locations on the cloud communications network thereby providing an additional layer of redundancy and fault tolerance on the cloud network .

 Fault tolerance is a system design feature that enables a system to continue operation possibly at a reduced level also known as graceful degradation rather than failing completely when some part of the system fails or goes off line. The cloud communications network defined herein is a fault tolerant network. Redundancy is a duplication of critical components or functions or data storage of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the system.

For example if a first cloud network server including a first cloud storage object with a first portion of desired electronic content failed or was taken off line a second cloud network server including an encrypted copy of the first cloud storage object and the same first portion of the desired electronic content could be decrypted and sent to the cloud server network device for processing.

At Step the first cloud application determines new plural address locations of new selected ones of plural other different cloud server network devices each with one or more processors with the Galois field.

In one embodiment the input to the Galois field includes physical location information of the target network device and the output of the Galois field includes new plural address locations of new selected ones of the plural other different cloud server network devices which are the closest to a current physical location of the target network device . However the present invention is not limited to such embodiments other can be used to practice the invention.

At Step the first cloud application securely stores the determined new plural address locations in the cloud content location map with the first cloud application in the first non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device .

At Step the first cloud application securely sends the retrieved plural cloud storage objects to the new determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers on the cloud communications network with the determined plural address locations. The plural cloud storage objects are re distributed and located in new plural different locations on one or more public private community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network .

In one embodiment a request for stored electronic content triggers the de activation of the stored electronic content.

In another embodiment the first cloud application automatically periodically retrieves the cloud content storage map and retrieves plural cloud storage objects for stored electronic content. Method is then executed to periodically de activate stored electronic content and re distribute it and re store to other networks on the cloud communications network . This automatic execution helps make the cloud network more fault tolerant and provides redundancy of stored electronic content.

In another embodiment as was described above for storing a whole portion the cloud storage object including the whole portion of the desired cloud electronic content can be de activated with encryption. The cloud storage object including the whole portion of the desired electronic content is then sent to a new cloud server network device for storage in a new different location one of the networks on the cloud network .

The methods and systems described herein provide for electronic content storage and retrieval on cloud computing networks. The electronic content is divided into plural portions and stored in plural cloud storage objects. Storage locations for the plural cloud storage objects are selected using a Galois field and the plural cloud storage objects are distributed to various locations across the cloud network. When the electronic content is requested the plural portions are retrieved and transparently combined back into the original electronic content. No server network devices storing the plural cloud storage objects can individually determine locations of all portions of the electronic content on the cloud communications network thereby providing a first layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network. No target network devices requesting the electronic content can determine where the electronic content is stored thereby providing a second layer of security and privacy for the electronic content on the cloud communications network.

 Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics electrical engineering and computer science involving the quantification of information. Since its inception information theory has been used for data analysis.

Information theory is generally considered to have been invented in 1948 by Claude Shannon in his seminal work A Mathematical Theory of Communication vol. 27 pp. 379 423 623 656 July October 1948 the contents of which is incorporated by reference. The central paradigm of classical information theory is the engineering problem of the transmission of information over a noisy channel.

The most fundamental results of this theory are Shannon s source coding theorem which establishes that on average the number of bits i.e. ones and zeros needed to represent the result of an uncertain event is given by its entropy and Shannon s noisy channel coding theorem which states that reliable communication is possible over noisy channels provided that the rate of communication is below a certain threshold called the channel capacity. The channel capacity can be approached in practice by using appropriate encoding and decoding systems.

In information theory mutual information of two random variables is a quantity that measures the mutual dependence of the two random variables. The most common unit of measurement of mutual information is the bit when logarithms to the base 2 are used.

 Information Entropy is a concept from information theory. It is a measure of uncertainty. It tells how much information there is in an event. In general the more uncertain or random the event is the more information it will contain. A key measure of information theory is entropy which is usually expressed by the average number of bits needed for storage or communication.

In information theory information entropy is similar to randomness. A string of random English letters is said to have high information entropy in other words large amounts of entropy. However the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe by contrast have lower information entropy because when forming meaningful words certain combinations of letters are more likely to occur than others.

One method of information theory used for data analysis is what Claude E. Shannon described as Communication Without Noise. Shannon noted that the English language seems to be about 50 meaningless syntax letters and phrasing.

In such an embodiment as the original electronic messages are received the message are translated into binary and a stochastic process is used to process the messages.

The stochastic process is a process that creates an average message in terms of probabilities of various patterns of English letters occurring. Shannon defined a measure of information content I m called the self information of a received message m as is illustrated by Equation 3 log 3 where p m P M m is the probability that message m is chosen from all possible choices in the message space M.

Electronic content received on a cloud application includes a total message space M and individual portions of the electronic content include individual received messages s m .

Equation 3 causes messages with lower probabilities to contribute more to the overall value of information I m . In other words infrequently occurring messages are more valuable and frequently occurring messages are less valuable.

For example in English if a letter q appears in a word you can be almost certain it is followed by a letter u e.g. quack quadrant quick etc. because virtually all words in English that start with the letter q have a second letter including the letter u. This provides very little self information and such words starting with qu are easier to derive by examining only a few formative letters.

However if the letter q in a word followed by a letter i for the word qintar provides a large amount of information because virtually no words in the English language in the two letters qi. This provides a large amount of self information and such words are more difficult to derive by examining only a few formative letters.

The stochastic process is also valid for short hand syntax used in IM SMS etc. For example a user of a target network device may encode the message talk to you at 3 o clock as tk 2 u 3 odk and so on. The stochastic process used herein properly handles such translations from portions of short hand syntax to whole English words.

In one embodiment information entropies of a pre determined alphabet with a pre determined set of symbols is used to split received original electronic content using Equation 3 . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments and other methods used to determine information entropies can be used to practice the invention.

The stochastic process is also used to provide an additional layer of security and privacy by splitting electronic information into plural pieces to prevent information gain based on information entropy and or mutual information that may be determined by a third party eavesdropping on the electronic content received and stored with the methods and systems described herein.

For example entropy probabilities for two portions of electronic information x and y that will be examined and or compared is illustrated by Equation 4 Entropy log log 4 wherein log is used with base 2 3 4 . . . 10 . . . etc.

By examining entropies a measure of information gain or how much information can be gained by eavesdropping and or view the plural portions of the electronic content is determined. Equation 5 illustrates information gain Information gain Entropy before Entropy after 5 

The calculations from Equations 3 through 5 are done for each portion m of the electronic content over the whole electronic content M . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments with different equations can be used to practice the invention.

In one embodiment the portions with the largest information gain are chosen to split into two or more smaller separate portions and stored in two or more separate locations on the cloud network using the Galois field. In another embodiment the portions with the smallest information gain are chosen to combine into one larger portion. In another embodiment the portions with the largest information gains are chosen to combine into one larger portion. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

For any probability distribution entropy is extended to define mutual information which is a measure of an amount of information one random variable includes about another. Entropy then becomes the self information e.g. Equation 3 etc. of a random variable X or Y . Mutual information is a special case of a more general quantity called relative entropy which is a measure of a distance between two probability distributions of information.

Equation 6 illustrates calculation of mutual information I X Y probability values of two discrete random variables X and Y obtained from selected portions mand mof the received of the received electronic content M 

In the case of continuous instead of discrete random variables X and Y the summation in Equation 6 is replaced by a definite double integral where p x y is instead a joint probability density function of X and Y and p x and p y are marginal probability distribution functions of X and Y respectively.

Mutual information is also a concern when storing electronic content. Mutual information measures information that X and Y share it measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other. For example if X and Y are independent then knowing X does not give any information about Y and vice versa so their mutual information is zero. At the other extreme if X and Y are identical then all information conveyed by X is shared with Y. Knowing X determines the value of Y and vice versa. As a result in the case of identity the mutual information is the same as the uncertainty contained in Y or X alone namely the entropy of Y or X. Clearly if X and Y are identical they have equal entropy.

If an entropy of X is regarded as a measure of uncertainty about a random variable X then X Y is a measure of what Y does not say about X . This is the amount of uncertainty remaining about X after Y is known and thus the amount of uncertainty in X minus the amount of uncertainty in X which remains after Y is known. This is equivalent to the amount of uncertainty in X which is removed by knowing Y. Thus the general meaning of mutual information includes an amount of information that is reduction in uncertainty that knowing either variable X or Y provides about the other.

In one embodiment the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y is used as a measure of the mutual dependence of the two random variables. The most common unit of measurement of mutual information is the bit. In such an embodiment a bit can only include a value zero or one so log base 2 e.g. log is used in Equations 3 through 6 .

The techniques illustrated in Equations 3 through 6 are exemplary only. The present invention is not limited by these exemplary equations. More fewer and or other types of equations entropy and or information gain sharing and or mutual information processes can be used to practice the invention.

For example if a first portion X as mof electronic content M included the English text from U.S. President Abraham Lincoln s famous Gettysburg address speech For score and seven years ago and a second portion Y as mincluded the English text our fathers brought forth on this continent the exact next phrase in the speech then the mutual dependence and mutual information between X and Y is very high i.e. a probability that X is dependent on Y is very high . So if X were stored in one location on the cloud communications network and Y in another an eavesdropper could easily reconstruct the original text by searching the next phrase in the speech etc. The eavesdropper may be able to eventually determine based on the original text of the speech how the electronic content was actually split up and stored e.g. a Galois field was used inputs to the Galois field etc. on the cloud communications network based on information entropy of mutual information and information gain.

However if a first portion X as m For score and seven years ago and a second portion Y as mincluded the English text all men are created equal then the mutual information and information gain obtained by using X and Y is much lower than in the first example. Even though the English text of Y as mappears in the Gettysburg address as the last five words of line one it also appears in a huge number of other documents e.g. the U.S. Constitution etc. speeches e.g. Dr. Martin Luther King s speeches etc. books articles etc. So in this second example if X were stored in one location on the cloud communications network and Y in another an eavesdropper would have a much hard time to eventually determine based on the electronic content was split up and stored e.g. a Galois field was used inputs to the Galois field etc. on the cloud communications network based on information entropy of mutual information and information gain.

The methods and systems described herein used to split and store portions of electronic content to reduce eavesdropping by observing mutual information and information gain.

The examples used herein are simple examples used for illustrative purposes and do not limit the invention. The invention is not limited to the English language and or symbols e.g. letters etc. in the English alphabet and other languages with other alphabets and or symbols can be used to practice the invention.

These examples above assume the original text of the electronic content is stored as plain text and not encrypted etc. However the same type of mutual information and information gain attacks can be used for encrypted information as well.

Information theory and the stochastic process concepts apply to cryptography and cryptanalysis as well. When plaintext is encrypted with many of the encryption methods described herein using an encryption key e.g. RSA DES AES etc. some mutual information exists between the plaintext and ciphertext. Any positive conditional mutual information between plaintext and ciphertext conditioned on an encryption key can subject the ciphertext to attack by analyzing any conditional mutual information discovered while examining transmission of ciphertext over a period of time.

Problems occur when such mutual information can be gathered in real time as the ciphertext is transmitted. Mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext can be used to break an encryption scheme. However the practical consideration is how long it will take. Even with using plural powerful computing devices it may take several hundred or thousands of years to defeat an encryption scheme which is not useful or practical to provide any value.

When any positive conditional mutual information exits between the plaintext and the ciphertext an eavesdropper could improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key.

If there is no or very little mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext absolutely secure communications may result. In other words an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key.

One time pads OTPs are one example of information theoretically secure cryptography such that an encrypted message i.e. the ciphertext provides no information about the original message i.e. the plainext to a cryptanalyst except the maximum possible length of the message.

However the theoretical perfect security of the one time pad applies only in a theoretically perfect setting. No real world implementation of any cryptosystem can provide perfect security because practical considerations introduce potential vulnerabilities. These practical considerations of security and convenience have meant that the one time pad is in practice little used. Implementation difficulties have led to one time pad systems being broken and are so serious that they have prevented the one time pad from being adopted as a widespread tool in information security.

In one embodiment both Galois fields and information entropy are used to provide security and privacy for storage and retrieval of electronic content on a cloud communications network.

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment at In at Step electronic content is received on a first cloud application and stored in a first non transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device with the one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising one or more public communication networks one or more private networks one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks .

At Step the first cloud application determines a set of plural information entropy probabilities on first plural portions of the received electronic content . In one embodiment the first cloud application determines the set of information entropy probabilities using Equation 3 . In another embodiment the first cloud application determines the set of information entropy probabilities using Equations 3 through 6 . However the present invention is not limited to these embodiments and more fewer and or other types of methods can be used to determine the set of plural information entropy probabilities.

In one embodiment first cloud application determines a set of plural information entropy probabilities based on a set of symbols in a pre determined alphabet. For example the set of symbols include the letters a z and A Z punctuation characters and or keyboard characters e.g. etc. . in the English alphabet the set of symbols includes American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII symbols for an ASCII encoded binary alphabet see e.g. RFC 4880 the set of symbols includes the numbers zero through 15 and the characters a f and A F for a hexadecimal alphabet the set of symbols includes electronic word abbreviations e.g. LOL for laughing out loud U for you UR for your for at etc. for a text messaging alphabet the set of symbols includes zero through seven for an octal alphabet the set of symbols includes the number zero and one for a binary alphabet the set of symbols includes QR bar codes for a QR bar code alphabet and or other bar code alphabet e.g. Tables 4 and 5 etc. the set of symbols includes a plaintext and or the cipher text for an encryption method and or a security method etc. However the present invention is not limited to these embodiments and more fewer and or other types of alphabets languages e.g. Spanish French German Chinese Japanese etc. symbols etc. can be used to practice the invention.

The examples used herein are simple examples used for illustrative purposes and do not limit the invention. The invention is also not limited to the English language and or symbols in the English alphabet and other languages with other alphabets and or symbols can be used to practice the invention.

At Step the received electronic content is split by the first cloud application into second plural portions based on a selected set of information entropy probabilities from the determined set of plural information entropies with the first cloud application thereby providing a first level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on the determined plural information entropies.

At Step the first cloud application saves the second plural portions in a plural cloud storage objects .

In at Step the first cloud application determines plural address locations of selected ones of plural other different cloud server network devices each with one or more processors are determined with a Galois field. An input to the Galois field produces an output including an address location of a desired cloud server on the cloud communications network. The address location can be located anywhere on the one or more public communication networks one or more private networks one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks of the cloud communications network .

At Step the determined plural address locations are securely stored in a cloud content location map with the first cloud application in the first non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device .

In at Step the first cloud application securely sends the plural cloud storage objects to the determined selected ones of the plural other different cloud servers on the cloud communications network with the determined plural address locations thereby providing a second level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on use of the Galois field. The plural cloud storage objects are distributed and located in a plural different locations on the cloud communications network . None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices can individually determine locations of all portions of the received electronic content on the cloud communications network thereby providing a third level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content on the cloud communications network.

After executing Method the original electronic content is requested and returned to a target network device from the first cloud application on the cloud server network device on the cloud communications network using Methods described above. However at Step of Method since the second cloud application on the target network device cannot determine the desired original cloud electronic content was stored as plural portions in plural cloud storage objects and cannot determine which of plural selected ones of the other different cloud server network devices on the one or more public private community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network may have stored portions of the final desired cloud electronic content this thereby provides a fourth layer of security and privacy instead of just a second layer of security and privacy for the desired cloud electronic content on the cloud communications network .

Method is used to reduce and or eliminate eavesdropping and other hacking attacks on the secure cloud storage system by using information entropies including information gain and mutual information entropies to split portions of received electronic content and a Galois field to create storage locations to securely store the split portions of electronic content.

The information entropies used along with the Galois filed help prevent an eavesdropper from re constructing original electronic content i.e. plaintext by re constructing the plural pieces stored at plural locations on the cloud communications network back into the whole original electronic document.

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment at Step with the first cloud application creates the first plural portions by determines an average message size m in the received electronic content in terms of probabilities of various patterns of symbols in the pre determined alphabet occurring in a selected portion m of the received electronic content comprising a total message space M .

At Step the first cloud application determines the plural information entropy probabilities as I m log m where p m P M m is a probability that message m is chosen from all possible choices in the total message space M from Equation 3 .

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

The methods and systems described herein provide electronic content storage and retrieval using Galois Fields and information entropy on cloud computing networks. The electronic content is divided into plural portions and stored in plural cloud storage objects based on determined information entropy probabilities of the electronic content thereby reducing location guessing of the electronic content with information gain and mutual information. Storage locations for the plural cloud storage objects are selected using a Galois field and the plural cloud storage objects are distributed across the cloud network. When the electronic content is requested the plural portions are retrieved and transparently combined back into the original electronic content. No server network devices storing the plural cloud storage objects or target network devices requesting the stored electronic can individually determine locations of all portions of the stored electronic content on the cloud communications network thereby providing various levels of security and privacy for the electronic content.

A geometric shape is geometric information which remains when location scale orientation and reflection are removed from the description of a geometric object. With a geometric shape a result of moving a shape around enlarging it rotating it or reflecting it in a mirror is the same shape as the original and not a distinct shape. Objects that have the same shape as each other are said to be similar. If they also have the same scale as each other they are said to be congruent. 

Many two dimensional 2D geometric shapes are defined by a set of points and or vertices and or lines connecting the set points in a closed chain as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called polygons and include triangles squares and pentagons. Other 2D shapes may be bounded by curves such as the circle or the ellipse.

Many three dimensional 3D geometric shapes are defined by a set of vertices lines connecting the vertices and two dimensional faces enclosed by those lines as well as the resulting interior points. Such shapes are called polyhedrons and include cubes as well as pyramids such as tetrahedrons. Other 3D shapes may be bounded by curved surfaces such as the ellipsoid and the sphere.

Geometric 4D shapes are generated by applying the rules of vectors and coordinate geometry to a space with four dimensions. In particular a vector with four elements i.e. a 4 tuple etc. can be used to represent a position in four dimensional space. The space is a Euclidean space so has a metric and norm and so all directions are treated as the same the additional 4dimension is indistinguishable from the other three.

Four dimensional 4D geometric shapes are typically defined by Euclidean space generalizing the rules of 3D space. In geometry Euclidean space encompasses a 2D Euclidean plane a 3D space of Euclidean geometry and certain other spaces.

There is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension. With Cartesian coordinates it is modelled by a real coordinate space R of the same dimension X. In one dimension this is a line in two dimensions it is a Cartesian plane and in higher dimensions it is a coordinate space with three or more real number coordinates. The X dimensional Euclidean space is denoted by Eif it is necessary to emphasize its Euclidean nature but Ris used as well since the latter is assumed to have the standard Euclidean structure and these two structures are not always distinguished.

One way to define a Euclidean plane is as a set of points satisfying certain relationships expressible in terms of distances and angles. For example there are two fundamental operations referred to as motions on a plane. One is translation which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is rotation about a fixed point in the plane in which every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same angle.

One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures i.e. usually considered as subsets of the plane should be considered equivalent i.e. congruent if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations rotations and reflections. In order to define a plane precisely the Euclidean plane must clearly define the notions of distance angle translation and rotation for a mathematically described space. Once a Euclidean plane has been precisely described it is actually a simple matter to extend the plane to arbitrary dimensions e.g. Xdimension etc. .

Geometric shapes and a path through components of the geometric shape are created to add one or more additional layer of privacy and security for storing original electronic content as original plaintext on the cloud communications network as a hacker and or observer and or eavesdropper would have to guess the geometric shape components e.g. vertices lines faces etc. selected for the geometric shape and a selected path through the selected components.

The illustrated tesseract is a 3D cube expanded to one type 4D shape. The tesseract is to the 3D cube as the 3D cube is to the square . Just as the surface of the cube includes of six square faces the hypersurface of the tesseract includes eight cubical cells. There are other types of tesseracts that can be created from a 3D cube and the present invention is not limited to the exemplary tesseract illustrated in .

In this example the segment numbers 1 7 from Table 8 match the Galois Field multiplication and addition output values output values 1 7 from the modified GF 2 with polynomial P x x x 1 illustrated in Tables 6 and 7. In this example the received electronic content is split into seven pieces and stored in seven different cloud storage objects e.g. numbered . . . etc. . However the present invention is not limited to such an exemplary embodiment and other embodiments can also be used to be practice the invention.

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment at in at Step electronic content is received on a cloud application and stored in a non transitory computer readable medium on a cloud server network device e.g. etc. with the one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising one or more public communication networks one or more private networks one or more community networks and or one or more hybrid networks .

At Step the cloud application creates a geometric shape defined by a set of Xdimensional shape components. The set of Xdimensional shape components includes but is not limited to a set of points set of vertices e.g. 3D cube a set lines connecting the set of points in a closed chain a set of resulting interior points a set of faces a set of vectors and or a set of coordinates for the created geometric shape . The exact set of shape components depends on a number of dimensions selected to create an Xdimensional shape.

For example if a 2D shape triangle square circle etc. is selected a set of points and or vertices and or lines connecting the set points in a closed chain a set of faces and or a set resulting interior points are selected.

If a 3D shape e.g. pyramid cube sphere etc. is selected a set of vertices a set of lines connecting the set of vertices a set of 2D faces enclosed by the set of lines as well as a resulting and or a set of interior points are selected.

If a 4D shape e.g. tesseract etc. is selected geometric 4D shapes are generated by applying the rules of vectors and coordinate geometry to a 3D space into four dimensions. In particular a vector with four elements i.e. a 4 tuple etc. are used to represent positions in four dimensional space in the 4D geometric shape.

However the present invention is not limited to such embodiments and other geometric shape components of other Xdimensions can be used to practice the invention.

In another embodiment at Step one or more different geometric shapes defined by a set of Xdimensional shape components are created. In such an embodiment the one or more different geometric shapes e.g. cube pyramid etc. include one or more different types of shapes and or with different of Xdimensional shape components.

At Step the cloud application securely stores the created geometric shape on the cloud server network device .

At Step the cloud application securely spits the received electronic content into plural portions of electronic content based on the created geometric shape e.g. with information theory methods or the other methods etc. described above etc. 

At Step the cloud application determines a path with pelements e.g. 2 through a selected set of components e.g. vertices 1 8 of 3D cube comprising the created geometric shape .

For example if a 2D shape triangle square circle etc. is selected a path p through a set of points and or vertices and or lines connecting the set points in a closed chain a set of faces and or a set resulting interior points can be selected.

If a 3D shape e.g. pyramid cube sphere etc. a path p is selected through a set of vertices a set of lines connecting the set of vertices a set of 2D faces enclosed by the set of lines and or a resulting set of interior points is selected.

If a 4D shape e.g. tesseract etc. a patch p is selected for 4D shapes by applying the rules of vectors and coordinate geometry to a 3D shape space with four dimensions. In particular a vector with four elements i.e. a 4 tuple etc. is used to represent a position in four dimensional space.

In addition the path can include combinations of these geometric shape components can be selected through the same e.g. vertices etc. or plural different types of shape components e.g. a vertex A cube a line A pyramid a face A tesseract a vertex B pyramid a line B tesseract a face B cube through plural shapes with the same or different X dimensions and or through a single shape with X dimensions.

However the present invention is not limited to such embodiments and other geometric shape components of other Xdimensions can be used to practice the invention.

In at Step the cloud application saves the plural portions of electronic content in the plural cloud storage objects . This thereby provides a first level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on the created geometric shape and the path through the geometric shape .

As an example a hacker and or observer and or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine the type of geometric shape selected the number of dimensions used for the shape the shape components selected and the path through the geometric shape as a first step to determine where on the cloud network the received electronic content might be stored. This thereby provides a first level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content .

At Step the cloud application creates a modified Galois field GF p e.g. Tables 6 7 8 etc. comprising a populating a first portion of a Galois field lookup table in the modified Galois field GF p with punique field elements comprising the ppath elements through the created geometric shape b populating a second portion of the Galois field lookup table with a plural virtual network address locations actual network address locations virtual protocol port address designations and actual protocol port address designations e.g. Tables 7 8 etc. for locating a plural other cloud server network devices each with one or more processors on the cloud communications network and c securely storing the modified Galois field GF p on the cloud server network device .

At Step the cloud application inputs one or more pre determined inputs into the modified Galois field GF p Tables 6 8 securely stored on the cloud server network device .

At Step the cloud application outputs from the modified Galois field GF p plural different types of address locations including virtual network address locations actual network address locations virtual protocol port address designations and or actual protocol port address designations and or combinations thereof stored in the Galois Field lookup table in the modified Galois Field GF p Tables 6 8 .

As an example a hacker and or observer and or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine what one or more inputs are used for the modified Galois field GF p which one or one more polynomials are used for the modified Galois field GF p and what pfield values are associated with what virtual network address locations actual network address locations virtual protocol port address designations and or actual protocol port address designations stored in the Galois Field lookup table are output from the modified Galois Field GF p . This thereby provides a second level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content based on the modified Galois field GF p .

In at Step the cloud application securely stores the determined plural address locations in a cloud content location map in the non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device .

At Step the cloud application securely sends the plural cloud storage objects etc. to the determined selected ones of the plural other cloud servers on the cloud communications network with the determined plural address locations. The plural cloud storage objects etc. are assigned to different portions e.g. path segments 1 7 of the geometric shape and distributed and located in plural different locations on the cloud communications network . None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices can individually determine the locations of all portions of the received electronic content on the cloud communications network .

As an example a hacker and or observer and or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine which portions of the received electronic content was put in which cloud storage objects etc. and stored on which other cloud servers to access all the original received electronic content . This thereby provides a third level of security and privacy for storing the received electronic content on the cloud communications network .

The first through third layers of security and privacy are achieved for storing electronic content on the cloud communications network without encrypting the received electronic content which comprises plaintext.

In another embodiment the received electronic content is translated into ciphertext using any of the encryption or security methods described herein. The ciphertext is then used with Method . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

The stored electronic content stored with Method of is retrieved using Method from . However the present invention is not limited to these embodiments and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

After executing Method the original electronic content is requested and returned to a target network device and or wearable device from the first cloud application on the cloud server network device on the cloud communications network using Method described above. However at Step of Method since the second cloud application on the target network device and or wearable device cannot determine the desired original cloud electronic content was stored as plural portions in plural cloud storage objects and cannot determine which of plural selected ones of the other different cloud server network devices on the one or more public private community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network may have stored portions of the final desired cloud electronic content this thereby provides a fourth layer of security and privacy instead of just a second layer of security and privacy for the desired cloud electronic content on the cloud communications network when used with Method .

 Wearable mobile technology and or wearable devices are clothing and accessories incorporating computer and advanced electronic technologies. Wearable mobile network devices provide several advantages including but not limited to 1 Quicker access to notifications. Important and or summary notifications are sent to alert a user to view a whole new message. 2 Heads up information. Digital eye wear allows users to display relevant information like directions without having to constantly glance down 3 Always on Searches. Wearable devices provide always on hands free searches and 4 Recorded data and feedback. Wearable devices also take telemetric data recordings and providing useful feedback for users for exercise health fitness etc. activities.

Digital eyewear such as GOOGLE Glass Smart watches by SONY NIKE GARMIN SAMSUNG wrist bands and or fitness bands by LG NIKE FITBIT etc. and others are examples of wearable mobile devices. Just like mobile and non mobiles phones a current physical location of such wearable mobile devices must be determine in an emergency situation.

Peer to peer P2P computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer to peer network of nodes where every node is connected to every other node in the P2P network.

Peers make a portion of their resources such as processing power disk storage or network bandwidth directly available to other network participants without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources in contrast to the traditional client server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.

Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers yet that are beneficial to all the peers.

A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as completed blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear chronological order. Blockchains are used on P2P networks and other networks such as cloud communications networks. Each P2P node gets a copy of the blockchain which gets downloaded automatically upon joining P2P. The blockchain has complete information about the block owners and block content right from the first block to the most recently completed block.

A blockchain is also a digital ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred. Blockchains and transactions on blockchains are typically protected by cryptography. More importantly though the blockchain does not reside in a single server but across a distributed network of servers and computer such as a cloud computing network and a P2P computing network. Accordingly whenever new transactions occur a new blockchain is authenticated across this distributed network then the transaction is included as a new block on the chain. A block chain implementation comprises of two kinds of records transactions and blocks.

 Transactions are the content to be stored in the block chain e.g. financial transactions etc. . Transactions are created by participants using the system. In the case of cryptocurrencies a transaction is created any time a cryptocurrency owner sends cryptocurrency to someone.

A transaction is also a transfer of value between digital wallets that gets included in the block chain. Digital wallets including BITCOIN wallets store a secret piece of data called a private key or which is used to digitally sign transactions providing a mathematical proof that the digital signature has actually come from the owner of the digital wallet.

System users create transactions that are passed from node to node on a best effort basis. The system implementing the blockchain defines a valid transaction. In cryptocurrency applications a valid transaction must be digitally signed spend one or more unspent outputs of previous transactions and the sum of transaction outputs must not exceed the sum of inputs.

Blocks record and confirm when and in what sequence transactions enter and are logged in the block chain. Blocks are created by users known as miners who use specialized software or equipment designed specifically to create blocks.

In a cryptocurrency system miners are incentivized to create blocks to collect two types of rewards a pre defined per block award and fees offered within the transactions themselves payable to any miner who successfully confirms the transaction.

BITCOIN is a digital cryptocurrency created in 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto whose true identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority unlike government issued currencies. The 2009 whitepaper entitled Bitcoin A Peer to peer electronic cash system by Satoshi Nakamato bitcoin.org is incorporated herein by reference.

There are no physical BITCOINS only balances associated with public and private keys. These balances are kept on a public ledger a blockchain along with all BITCOIN transactions that is verified by a massive amount of computing power. A BITCOIN is defined as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the BITCOIN to a next owner by digitally signing a hash a previous transaction and the public key of a next owner and adding these to the end of the BITCOIN.

BITCOIN and other blockchains use a pre determined hash algorithm to turn an arbitrarily large amount of data into a fixed length hash. The same hash will always result from the same data but modifying the data by even one bit will completely change the hash. Like all computer data hashes are large numbers and are usually written as hexadecimal. BitCoin uses the SHA 256 hash algorithm described herein to generate verifiably random numbers in a way that requires a predictable amount of CPU effort.

BITCOIN balances are kept using public and private encryption keys which are long strings of numbers and letters linked through the mathematical encryption algorithm that was used to create them. The public key e.g. analogous to an account number serves as an address which is published to the world and to which others may send a BITCOIN. The private key e.g. analogous to a secret private PIN password etc. is meant to be a guarded secret and only used to authorize BITCOIN transmissions. Private BITCOIN keys of BITCOIN blocks are stored in digital wallets.

Blockchains are decentralized and do not require a central authority or middleman. Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the block chain. This avoids the need to have a centralized database managed by a trusted third party. Blockchain transactions are broadcast to a network using software applications. Network nodes can validate transactions add them to their copy and then broadcast these additions to other nodes. To avoid the need for a trusted third party to timestamp transactions decentralized block chains use various timestamping schemes such as proof of work.

The core advantages of the block chain architecture include but are not limited to those described in Table 9.

A digital wallet is a software program where blockchains are stored. A digital wallet stores a private encryption key for every blockchain address that is saved in the digital wallet of the person who owns the balance. Digital wallets facilitate sending and receiving blockchains and gives ownership of the blockchain balance if it includes financial information such as BITCOINS to a user.

A digital wallet stored on a communications network allows a user to use blockchains e.g. BITCOINS etc. from anywhere on any browser and or any mobile network device and or any smart network device and or any wearable network device. Storing a digital wallet must be done carefully since it stores private encryption keys for the blockchains online.

Method is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment at in at Step one or more new blocks e.g. etc. created for a blockchain are received on a cloud application on a cloud server network device with the one or more processors from a target application on a target network device with one or more processor via a cloud communications network .

At Step the cloud application securely stores the received one or more new blocks in the block chain in one or more cloud storage objects .

At Step the cloud application creates a modified Galois field GF p e.g. Tables 6 7 etc. comprising a populating a first portion of a Galois field lookup table in the modified Galois field GF p with punique field elements comprising the ppath elements through the created geometric shape b populating a second portion of the Galois field lookup table with a plural virtual network address locations actual network address locations virtual protocol port address designations and actual protocol port address designations e.g. Tables 6 7 etc. for locating a plural other cloud server network devices each with one or more processors on the cloud communications network and c securely storing the modified Galois field GF p on the cloud server network device .

At Step the cloud application inputs one or more pre determined inputs into the modified Galois field GF p e.g. Tables 6 7 etc. securely stored on the cloud server network device using any of the encryption methods and or security method described herein.

In at Step the cloud application outputs from the modified Galois field GF p plural different types of address locations including virtual network address locations actual network address locations virtual protocol port address designations and or actual protocol port address designations and or combinations thereof stored in the Galois Field lookup table in the modified Galois Field GF p Tables 6 8 .

As an example a hacker and or observer and or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine what one or more inputs are used for the modified Galois field GF p which one or one more polynomials are used for the modified Galois field GF p and what pfield values are associated with what virtual network address locations actual network address locations virtual protocol port address designations and or actual protocol port address designations stored in the Galois Field lookup table are output from the modified Galois Field GF p . This thereby provides a first level of security and privacy for storing the received one or more block chains based on the modified Galois field GF p .

At Step the cloud application securely stores the determined plural address locations in a cloud content location map in the non transitory computer readable medium on the cloud server network device .

At Step cloud application securely sends the one or more cloud storage objects including the received one or more new blocks in the blockchain to selected ones of the plural other cloud servers on the cloud communications network with the determined plural address locations determined with the Galois Field lookup table. None of the selected ones of plural other cloud server network devices cannot individually determine other locations of the received one or more new blocks in the blockchain on the cloud communications network thereby providing a second level of security and privacy for storing the received one or more new blocks in the block chain on the cloud communications network.

As an example a hacker and or observer and or eavesdropper would have to guess or determine which of the one or more received blocks from the blockchain was put in which cloud storage objects etc. and stored on which other cloud servers to access all the original received blocks . This thereby provides a second level of security and privacy for storing the received one or more blocks from the blockchain on the cloud communications network .

The layers of security and privacy are achieved for storing received block chains on the cloud communications network without encrypting the received one or more blocks for the blockchain . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

In another embodiment the received one or more blocks are translated into ciphertext using any of the encryption or security methods described herein. The ciphertext is then used with Method . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can be used to practice the invention.

After executing Method the original one or more received blocks in the blockchain are requested and returned to a target network device from the first cloud application on the cloud server network device on the cloud communications network using Method described herein. In such an embodiment Method securely and transparently retrieves and securely sends the received desired one or more blocks that were stored by Method .

The second cloud application on the second target network device cannot determine the desired received one or more blocks in the blockchain was stored in the retrieved plurality of cloud storage objects and cannot determine which of the selected ones of the plurality of other different cloud server network devices thereby providing a third layer of security and privacy for desired received one or more blocks in the blockchain on the cloud communications network.

Method is used to reduce and or eliminate theft or other hacking attacks on the stored blocks in the blockchain with the modified Galois field. Stored block theft is accomplished involves a third party accessing the private key to a victim s block address e.g. private key BITCOIN private address etc. or block address stored an online digital wallet. If the private key is stolen all the blocks in the blockchain from the compromised stolen private key address can be transferred. In this case because there is no central authority the network does not have any provisions to identify the thief block further transactions of those stolen blocks e.g. BITCOINS etc. or return them to the legitimate owner.

The method and system described herein include securely storing and retrieving or more blocks for a blockchain with a modified Galois Fields on a cloud or peer to peer P2P communications network. The modified Galois Field provides at least additional layers for security and privacy for blockchains. The blocks and blockchains are securely stored and retrieved for cryptocurrency transactions including BITCOIN transactions and other cryptocurrency transactions.
