title: Using connections between users in a social networking system to regulate operation of a machine associated with a social networking system user
abstract: A social networking system includes information identifying a machine (e.g., a robot, a drone, a computer, a thermostat, etc.) and a connection between the machine and an owner of the machine, which is a user of the social networking system capable of authorizing an action by the machine. The owner of the machine associates permissions associated with various actions by the machine, where a permission associated with an action identifies one or more criteria for performing the action. Permissions may specify types of connections between social networking system users and the owner of the machine via the social networking system to allow social networking system users with specific types of connections to the owner of the machine to perform certain actions using the machine.

The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 488 227 filed Sep. 16 2014 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to social networking systems and more specifically to modifying one or more machine learned models used by an online system.

An online system such as a social networking system allows its users to connect to and communicate with other online system users. Users may create profiles on an online system that are tied to their identities and include information about the users such as interests and demographic information. The users may be individuals or entities such as corporations or charities. Establishing connections with other users via an online system allows a user to more easily share content with the other users.

Additionally users are increasingly able to access various machines via client devices allowing users to remotely configure and control their machines. For example users may modify thermostat settings via an application executing on a mobile device or retrieve vehicle diagnostic information using another application executing on the mobile device. However different applications are associated with different machines making it inconvenient for a user to remotely configure or control multiple machines.

Further conventional applications for remotely controlling a machine limit control of the machine to a user having an application associated with the machine installed on a client device. But a user may benefit if additional users are capable of accessing a machine associated with the user to retrieve information or to perform actions via the machine. Conventional systems require each user accessing a machine to have an application associated with the machine installed on a client device associated with the user which allows multiple users to control or access the machine but makes it impractical for a user to regulate or limit interactions with the machine other users are authorized to perform.

A social networking system stores connections between various users allowing users to exchange content with each other. Additionally the social networking system stores information identifying a machine which is a device that receives one or more instructions and performs an action in response to the one or more instructions. For example a machine receives a control signal from the social networking system and performs an action based on the control signal. Example machines include a thermostat an automobile a drone a toaster a thermostat a computer a refrigerator an air conditioner a robot a vacuum an actuator and a heater. The social networking system includes information identifying the machine and one or more connections between the machine and one or more users capable of authorizing one or more actions associated with the machine also referred to herein as owners. 

The stored information also includes various permissions associated with the machine with each permission associated with an action performed by the machine and regulating users of the social networking system who in addition to the owner of the machine are authorized to perform the action. The owner of the machine specifies or modifies permissions associated with various actions. A permission associated with an action specifies a type of connection between a user of the social networking system and the owner of the machine that authorizes the user to perform the action. In one embodiment the type of connection between a user and an owner of the machine is based on whether the user is directly or indirectly connected to the owner of the machine. Different types of indirect connections may be specified based on a number of intervening users between the user and the owner of the machine i.e. based on a degree of separation between the user and the owner of the machine . For example a permission associated with an action allows a user having a direct connection to the owner of the machine to perform the action while preventing another user having an indirect connection to the owner of the machine from performing the action. Alternatively a permission specifies a user having a connection to an owner of the machine having a specified connection strength is authorized to perform an action associated with the permission while preventing another user having a connection to the owner of the machine with less than the specified connection strength from performing the action.

When the social networking system receives a request for the machine to perform an action from a requesting user if the requesting user does not have a connection to the machine via the social networking system indicating the requesting user is an owner of the machine the social networking system determines a connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine and determines a type of the connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine and compares the type of connection to a permission associated with the action identified by the request. If the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine matches a type of connection specified by the permission associated with the action the social networking system determines the requesting user is authorized to perform the action and communicates an instruction to perform the action to the machine. If the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine does not match the type of connection specified by the permission associated with the action the social networking system determines the requesting user is not authorized to perform the action.

In some embodiments the permissions are hierarchical so a user having a type of connection to the owner of the machine matching a type of connection specified by permission associated with an action is also authorized to perform additional actions associated with one or more additional types of connections to the owner of the machine. Additionally the request may include an amount of compensation to be provided from the requesting user to the owner of the machine if the requesting user is authorized to perform the action and the amount of compensation as well as the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine are used to determine whether the requesting user is authorized to perform the action.

The figures depict various embodiments for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.

The client devices are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the social networking system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the social networking system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with the social networking system which is further described below in conjunction with . In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device or communicating data to client devices for use by an application executing on the client device. In other embodiments a third party system provides content or other information for presentation via a client device . A third party system may also communicate information to the social networking system such as advertisements content or information about an application provided by the third party system .

Additionally one or more machines are coupled to the network for communicating with the social networking system with one or more client devices or with one or more third party systems . A machine is a device that receives one or more instructions and performs an action in response to the one or more instructions. For example a machine receives a control signal from the social networking system or from a client device and performs an action based on the control signal. Example machines include a thermostat an automobile a drone a toaster a refrigerator an air conditioner a robot a vacuum a computer and a heater. Additionally a client device may be a machine . One or more permissions are associated with a machine where each permission is associated with an action and specifies one or more criteria for performing an action. The permissions may be communicated from the machine to the social networking system . Permissions and communication between a machine and the social networking system are further described below in conjunction with .

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding online system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with information identifying the social networking system users displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the social networking system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the social networking system for connecting and exchanging content with other online system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the online system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the online system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that each represent various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a page e.g. brand page or any other type of content. Online system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the social networking system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence online system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the social networking system through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the social networking system .

One or more objects associated with machines are included in the content store in various embodiments. An object associated with a machine includes an identifier associated with the machine that uniquely identifies the machine . In various embodiments the object associated with the machine also includes additional information describing the machine . For example the object associated with the machine includes one or more of a description of the machine e.g. a manufacturer a model number a name a description of the machine a name associated with the machine by a user of the social networking system capable of authorizing actions associated with the machine a location associated with the machine permissions associated with the machine each associated with an action and identifying one or more criteria to be satisfied for the action to be performed or other suitable information. Additionally an object associated with a machine may include information describing actions associated with the machine such as text or image data for presentation to social networking system users to identify the action.

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as with other applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the social networking system . For example an e commerce website may recognize a user of a social networking system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as in the preceding example may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the social networking system to the social networking system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. An edge between a user and another user may be associated with a connection strength specified by the user and providing information about a relationship between the user and the other user. For example connections between a user and other users with which the user has a close relationship such as family members have relatively high connection strengths while connections between the user and additional users with which the user has a more distant relationship have lower connection strengths. In some embodiments a user selects from connection strengths associated with different types of relationships e.g. family members co workers friends partners etc. when specifying a connection with another user and the edge store associates a selected connection strength with an edge describing the connection. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system .

The edge store includes an edge representing a connection between an object associated with a machine and a user profile associated with a user capable of authorizing one or more actions associated with the machine also referred to herein as an owner of the machine. Multiple edges between an object associated with a machine and different owners of the machine may be stored in the edge store to identify various owners of the machine . Additionally edges between an object associated with the machine and other users of the social networking system may identify connections between the other users and the machine . As further described below in conjunction with information associated with a connection between a user and a machine e.g. a type of the connection may allow the user to perform certain actions using the machine . In some embodiments the edge store also includes edges representing connections between objects associated with different machines allowing the corresponding machines to exchange information with each other via the social networking system . Additionally a connection between an object associated with a machine and an additional object associated with an additional machine may identifies the machine as an owner of the additional machine this allows the machine to specify permissions for authorizing users to perform actions associated with the additional machine .

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and objects or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the social networking system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object or in another user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object a topic or another user in the social networking system based on actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

The permission manager receives requests from requesting users to perform actions associated with one or more machines connected to various users and determines whether a requesting user is authorized to perform an action via a machine . One or more permissions are associated with the machine each permission associated with an action performed by the machine and specifying one or more criteria to be satisfied for the action to be performed. An owner of the machine configures the permissions associated with the machine to limit actions that various other users may perform using the machine . A permission associated with an action specifies a type of connection between a user of the social networking system and the owner of the machine that authorizes the user to perform the action. The user of the social networking system may be a machine so a type of connection between a machine and an additional machine may authorize the machine to perform an action using the additional machine . In one embodiment the type of connection between a user and an owner of the machine is based on whether the user is directly or indirectly connected to the owner of the machine different types of indirect connections may be specified based on a number of intervening users between the user and the owner of the machine i.e. based on a degree of separation between the user and the owner of the machine . For example a permission associated with an action allows a user having a direct connection to the owner of the machine to perform the action while preventing another user having an indirect connection to the owner of the machine from performing the action. Alternatively a permission specifies a connection strength of a connection between a user and an owner of the machine authorizing the user to perform an action associated with the permission and preventing another user having a connection to the owner of the machine with less than the specified connection strength from performing the action.

In some embodiments a permission associated with an action may specify a time interval during which a user satisfying criteria specified by the permission is authorized to perform the action. For example a permission authorizes a user having an indirect connection to an owner of the machine via the social networking system to perform an action associated with the permission once during a twelve hour interval. A time interval specified by a permission may be determined or modified by an owner of the machine .

When the permission manager receives a request for a machine to perform an action from a requesting user the permission manager accesses the edge store to determine connections between the requesting user and an object associated with the machine and between the requesting user and one or more owners of the machine . If the edge store includes a connection between a user profile of the requesting user and the object associated with the machine indicating the requesting user is an owner of the machine the permission manager determines the requesting user is authorized to perform any action associated with the machine . However if the permission manger determines the edge store does not include a connection between the object associated with the machine and the user profile associated with the requesting user indicating the requesting user is an owner of the machine or that the connection between the object associated with the machine and the requesting user does not have a type matching a type specified by a permission associated with the action the permission manager determines whether the requesting user is connected to an owner of the machine based on information in the edge store . If the edge store does not include a connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine the permission manager prevents the machine from performing the action.

However if the edge store includes information identifying a connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine the permission manager determines a type of the connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine and compares the type of connection to a permission associated with the action identified by the request. If the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine matches a type of connection specified by the permission associated with the action the permission manager determines the requesting user is authorized to perform the action and communicates an instruction to perform the action to the machine . In some embodiments users may establish direct connections to a machine through the social networking system . A connection between a user and the machine is associated with a type as described above. When the permission manager receives a request from the requesting user to perform the action the permission manager also determines a type of direct connection between the requesting user and the machine . If the social networking system includes a direct connection between the requesting user and the machine having a type satisfying a permission associated with the action the permission manager determines the requesting user is authorized to perform the action and communicates an instruction to perform the action to the machine . In various embodiments the social networking system may differently prioritize connections between the requesting user and the owner of the machine and connections between the requesting user and the machine when determining if the requesting user is authorized to perform the action. For example a type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine may take precedence over a type of connection between the requesting user and the machine when determining if the requesting user is authorized to perform an action using the machine . Determination of whether a requesting user is authorized to perform an action via a machine based on connections between the requesting user and other users of the social networking system is further described below in conjunction with .

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or BlackberryOS.

The social networking system stores data identifying the machine and connections between one or more users of the social networking system and the machine . For example the social networking system stores an object associated with the machine including a machine identifier uniquely identifying the machine . The object associated with the machine may include additional information associated with the machine such as a name associated with the machine model information of the machine a description of the machine or a location associated with the machine .

One or more connections between the machine and users of the social networking system are also stored . A connection between the machine and at least one social networking system user capable of authorizing one or more actions associated with the machine also referred to herein as an owner of the machine is stored . An action performed by the machine is associated with one or more permissions that regulate users capable of performing the action. The owner of the machine specifies or modifies one or more permissions associated with the action. A permission associated with an action specifies a type of connection between a user of the social networking system and the owner of the machine that authorizes the user to perform the action. For example a permission associated with an action allows a user having a direct connection to the owner of the machine to perform the action via the machine while preventing another user having an indirect connection to the owner of the machine to perform the action via the machine . As another example a permission associated with an action allows a user having a connection with at least a threshold connection strength to the owner of the machine e.g. a connection identifying the user as a family member of the owner of the machine to perform the action via the machine while preventing another user having a connection with less than the threshold connection strength to the owner of the machine e.g. a connection identifying the other user as a co worker of the owner of the machine from performing the action . Permissions associated with actions performed by the machine may be stored by the social networking system in association with the machine or with an owner of the machine or may be maintained by the machine .

A client device associated with a requesting user of the social networking system transmits a request to perform an action associated with the machine to the social networking system . The request includes an identifier associated with the requesting user an identifier associated with the machine and a description of the action for the machine to perform. Upon receiving the request the social networking system determines whether a connection between the requesting user and the machine is stored by the social networking system .

The social networking system also determines connections between the requesting user and one or more users connected to the machine and capable of authorizing one or more actions associated with the machine i.e. connections between the requesting user and one or more owners of the machine . Based on the connections between the requesting user and one or more owners of the machine the social networking system determines whether the requesting user is authorized to perform the action using the machine . In some embodiments the social networking system determines whether the requesting user is authorized to perform the action based on a connection between the user and the machine if no connection exists between the requesting user and the machine or if the type of connection between the user and the machine does not match a type specified by a permission associated with the action the social networking system determines connections between the requesting user and one or more owners of the machine . In these embodiments if a connection between the requesting user and the machine has a type satisfying a type specified by a permission associated with the action the social networking system may determine the requesting user is authorized to perform the action as further described below without determining connections between the requesting user and one or more owners of the machine . Alternatively the social networking system determines connections between the requesting user and the machine and also determines connections between the requesting user and one or more owners of the machine and determines whether the requesting user is authorized to perform the actions based on types of connections between the requesting user and the machine and types of connections between the requesting user and one or more owners of the machine .

To determine whether the requesting user is authorized to perform the action the social networking system determines a type associated with a connection between the requesting user and an owner of the machine and compares the determined type to types of connections specified by permissions associated with the action. If the determined type matches a type of connection specified by a permission associated with the action the social networking system determines the requesting user is authorized to perform the action. However if the determined type of connection does not match a type of connection specified by a permission associated with the action the social networking system determines the requesting user is not authorized to perform the action. As described above in conjunction with a type of connection between the requesting user and the machine may be compared to the type of connection specified by a permission associated with the action with the social networking system determining the requesting user is authorized to perform the action if the type of connection between the user and the machine matches the type of connection specified by the permission and determining the requesting user is not authorized to perform the action if the type of connection between the user and the machine does not match the type of connection specified by the permission.

For example the social networking system includes a connection between the requesting user and an owner of the machine with a connection strength having a specified value e.g. a connection indicating the requesting user is a family member of the owner of the machine so the social networking system determines the requesting user is authorized to perform actions via the machine that are associated with permissions specifying a connection having the specified value of connection strength however the requesting user is not determined to be authorized to perform actions via the machine associated with permissions specifying a different value of connection strength. As another example the social networking system determines whether the requesting user is authorized to perform the action based on whether a connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine is direct or indirect. For example permissions associated with the machine allow users directly connected to the owner of the machine to perform a set of actions while limiting users indirectly connected to the owner of the machine e.g. users connected to an additional user that is connected to the owner of the machine to performing a reduced set of actions via the machine . In this example the social networking system compares the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine i.e. whether the requesting user has a direct connection or an indirect connection to the owner of the machine to a type of connection specified by a permission associated with the action if the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine matches the type of connection associated with the permission the requesting user is determined to be authorized to perform the action.

In some embodiments the permissions are hierarchical so a user having a type of connection to the owner of the machine matching a type of connection specified by permission associated with an action is also authorized to perform additional actions associated with one or more additional types of connections to the owner of the machine . For example if a user has a direct connection to an owner of the machine the user is authorized to perform actions associated with permissions specifying a direct connection to the owner of the machine as well as actions associated with permissions specifying an indirect connection to the owner of the machine . However in this example another user having an indirect connection to the owner of the machine is not authorized to perform actions associated with permissions specifying a direct connection to the owner of the machine . In some embodiments the social networking system determines different types of indirect connections to the owner of the machine proportional to a number of intervening users between the requesting user and the owner of the machine . For example if the requesting user is connected to an additional user that is connected to the owner of the machine the social networking system determines the requesting user has a first order indirect connection to the owner of the machine as another example if the requesting user is connected to an additional user that is connected to another user that is connected to the owner of the machine the social networking system determines the requesting user has a second order indirect connection to the owner of the machine. Different types of indirect connections may be associated with different permissions to regulate the actions of the machine capable of being performed by users based on the number of intervening users between a user and the owner of the machine e.g. users with a greater number of intervening users between the user and the owner of the machine are authorized to perform fewer actions .

Additionally the received request may include an amount of compensation to the owner of the machine from the requesting user if the action is performed. The social networking system may account for the amount of compensation in addition to the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine when determining whether the requesting user is authorized to perform the action. For example the owner of the machine associates amounts of compensation with one or more actions allowing a requesting user to be authorized to perform an action if the requesting user provides the owner of the machine with at least the amount of compensation associated with the action. In one embodiment the owner of the machine authorizes a requesting user identifying at least an amount of compensation matching an amount of compensation with an action to perform the action even if a connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine does not match a type of connection specified by a permission associated with the action. Alternatively the requesting user is not determined to be authorized to perform the action unless the connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine has a type matching a type of connection specified by a permission associated with the action and the requesting user includes at least a threshold amount of compensation in the request. In some embodiments the social networking system determines a time interval during which the requesting user is authorized to perform the action based on the amount of compensation in the request. For example if the type of connection between the requesting user and the owner of the machine authorizes the requesting user to perform the action the requesting user is authorized to perform the action for a time interval proportional to the amount of compensation. When the time interval lapses the requesting user is not authorized to perform the action and may transmit an additional request to the social networking system to perform the action.

If the social networking system determines the requesting user is authorized to perform the action the social networking system transmits an instruction to perform the action to the machine which performs the action based on the instruction. For example the instruction is a control signal causing the machine to perform the action upon receipt of the control signal. Different types of machines may perform different types of actions based on an instruction received from the social networking system . Example actions performed by the machine include changing a position of the machine capturing video data capturing audio data retrieving stored data modifying one or more parameters or settings of the machine changing a state of the machine or any other suitable action. In some embodiments if the social networking system determines the requesting user is not authorized to perform the action the social networking system communicates a notification to the client device indicating the request is unable to be performed for presentation to the requesting user.

When the machine performs the action information describing the action may be transmitted from the machine to the social networking system which stores the information describing the action. For example the machine transmits a confirmation that the action was performed identifying the action and a time associated with the action e.g. a date and time when the action was completed a date and time when the action was initiated and the social networking system stores a description of the action and the time associated with the action in conjunction with the object associated with the machine . If the action retrieves information from the machine the machine transmits the retrieved information to the social networking system . In some embodiments the social networking system stores the retrieved information then communicates the retrieved information to the client device for presentation to the requesting user. Alternatively the social networking system communicates the retrieved information to the client device for presentation to the requesting user without storing the retrieved information. Additionally the social networking system stores an association between the performed action and the requesting user allowing the action to be used when selecting content for subsequent presentation to the user. In other embodiments after determining the user is authorized to perform the action the social networking system establishes a connection between the client device and the machine allowing the user associated with the client device to directly communicate with the machine to perform the action.

In some embodiments the social networking system presents information describing the action to the requesting user via the client device and may also present information describing the action to additional users having a connection to the requesting user. For example the social networking system presents a notification message to the user via the client device indicating the machine performed the action and may include information received from the machine based on the action in the notification message. To present information describing the action the social networking system generates a story identifying the requesting user identifying the machine and describing the action and presents the generated story to additional users connected to the requesting user via the social networking system .

In the example of the social networking system stores a connection A between user A and machine A indicating that user A is capable of authorizing one or more actions associated with machine A so user A is an owner of machine A. Similarly a connection B between user C and machine B identifies user C as an owner of machine B and a connection C between user C and machine C identifies user C as an owner of machine C. In the example of a connection between user A and user C has a connection strength indicating that user A is a co worker of user C while a connection between user C and user B has a higher connection strength than the connection which indicates that user C and user B are family members. Additionally a connection between user A and user B has a connection strength indicating that user A and user B are friends.

As shown in machine A is associated with permissions A identifying input output commands associated with machine A and a type of connection between a user authorized to perform an input output command and to an owner of machine A which is capable of performing any input output command associated with machine A . In the example of the connection type specified by permissions A is based on whether a user authorized to perform an input output command has a direct connection or an indirect connection to an owner of machine A. In the example of permissions A authorize a user with any type of connection either direct or indirect to an owner of machine A to turn machine A on or off authorize an owner of machine A to record data via machine A and authorize a user indirectly connected to an owner of machine A to view data captured by machine A. Additionally permissions A are hierarchical so a user having a direct connection to an owner of machine A is also authorized to perform actions that a user with an indirect connection to the owner of machine A is authorized to perform. In permissions identify a type of indirect connection between a user authorized to view data capture by machine A limiting viewing of the data to users that are connected to a single intervening user that is connected to an owner of machine A i.e. a user with one degree of separation from the owner of machine A and preventing users connected to a series of intervening users between the user and the owner of machine A i.e. a user with two or more degrees of separation from the owner of the machine A from viewing the data. Hence in the social networking system authorizes a request from user A to record data via machine A while denying a request from user B or user C to record data via machine A. Additionally the social networking system authorizes a request from user A user B or user C to view data captured by machine A.

Also in permissions B are associated with machine B to identify types of connections between a user authorized to perform an action via machine B and an owner of machine B. Permissions B specifies connection types based on a connection strength between a user and an owner of machine B. In the example of permissions B authorize users with any type of connection to an owner of machine B to turn machine B on or off authorize a user having a connection to an owner of machine B with a connection strength indicating the user is a family member of the owner of machine B to change a channel of machine B and authorize a user having a connection to an owner of machine B with a connection strength indicating the user is a co worker of the owner of machine B to view content stored by machine B. Hence because the connection between user B and user C has a connection strength indicating user B and user C are family the social networking system authorizes a request from user B to change a channel of machine B however because the connection between user A and user C has a connection strength indicating user A is a co worker of user C the social networking system does not authorize a request from user A to change a channel of machine B but authorizes a request from user A to view content stored by machine B.
