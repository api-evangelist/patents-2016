The present invention is directed to novel retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor gamma ROR or ROR gamma inhibitors processes for their preparation pharmaceutical compositions containing these inhibitors and their use in the treatment of inflammatory metabolic autoimmune and other diseases mediated by ROR.

Retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptors RORs are a subfamily of transcription factors in the steroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily Jetten Joo 2006 Adv. Dev. Biol. 2006 16 313 355 . The ROR family consists of ROR alpha ROR ROR beta ROR and ROR gamma ROR each encoded by a separate gene in human RORA RORB and RORC respectively in mouse rora rorb and rorc respectively . RORs contain four principal domains shared by the majority of nuclear receptors an N terminal domain a highly conserved DNA binding domain DBD consisting of two zinc finger motifs a hinge domain and a ligand binding domain LBD . Each ROR gene generates several isoforms differing only in their N terminal domains. ROR has two isoforms ROR1 and ROR2 also known as RORt . ROR refers to ROR1 and or RORt. ROR1 is expressed in a variety of tissues including thymus muscle kidney and liver but RORt is exclusively expressed in the cells of the immune system has a critical role in thymopoiesis and the development of several secondary lymphoid tissues and is a key regulator of Th17 cell differentiation Jetten 2009 Nucl. Recept. Signal. 7 e003 doi 10.1621 nrs.07003 Epub 2009 Apr. 3 .

Th17 cells are a subset of T helper cells which preferentially produce the pro inflammatory cytokines IL 17A IL 17F IL 21 and IL 22. Th17 cells and their effector molecules such as IL 17 IL 21 IL 22 GM CSF and CCL20 are associated with the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis psoriasis inflammatory bowel disease allergy and asthma Maddur et al. 2012 Am. J. Pathol. 181 8 18 . Recent findings support a role for IL17 and Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of acne Thiboutot et al. 2014 J. Invest. Dermatol. 134 2 307 10 doi 10.1038 jid.2013.400 Agak et al. 2014 J. Invest. Dermatol. 134 2 366 73 doi 10.1038 jid.2013.334 Epub 2013 Aug. 7 . Th17 cells are also potent inducers of inflammation associated with endometriosis a chronic inflammatory disease Hirata et al. 2010 Endocrinol. 151 5468 5476 Hirata et al. 2011 Fertil Steril. July 96 1 113 7 doi 10.1016 j.fertnstert.2011.04.060 Epub 2011 May 20 . Additionally Th17 cells have a key role in the mouse autoimmune models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE collagen induced arthritis CIA and adjuvant induced arthritis AIA Bedoya et al. 2013 Clin. Dev. Immunol. 2013 986789. Epub 2013 Dec. 26. Th17 cells are activated during inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes and are responsible for recruiting other inflammatory cell types particularly neutrophils to mediate pathology in target tissues Miossec Kolls 2012 Nature Rev. 11 763 776 Korn et al. 2009 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 27 485 517 . Aberrant Th17 cell function has been implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Autoimmune disease is believed to arise from the disruption of the equilibrium between effector and regulatory T cells Solt et al. 2012 ACS Chem. Biol. 7 1515 1519 Epub 2012 Jul. 9 . The importance of RORt to Th17 cell differentiation and the pathogenic role of Th17 cells is evidenced by the fact that RORt deficient mice have very few Th17 cells and have a reduction in severity of EAE Ivanov et al. 2006 Cell 126 1121 1133 .

Circadian rhythms are daily cycles of behavioral and physiological changes that are regulated by endogenous circadian clocks. A number of studies have established links between nuclear receptor including ROR function and expression the circadian regulatory circuitry and the regulation of various physiological processes Jetten 2009 op. cit. .

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome OSAS is a chronic inflammatory disease regulated by T lymphocytes. OSAS patients have a significant increase in peripheral Th17 cell frequency IL 17 and RORt levels Ye et al. 2012 Mediators Inflamm. 815308 doi 10.1155 2012 815308 Epub 2012 Dec. 31 .

A number of studies have provided evidence of a role of RORs in cancer. Mice deficient in the expression of ROR exhibit a high incidence of thymic lymphomas that metastasize frequently to liver and spleen. High expression of Th17 associated genes including ROR and high levels of Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis in various cancers including lung gastric breast and colon cancer Tosolini et al. 2011 Cancer Res. 71 1263 1271 doi 10.1158 0008 5472.CAN 10 2907 Epub 2011 Feb. 8 Su et al. 2014 Immunol. Res. 58 118 124 doi 10.1007 s12026 013 8483 y Epub 2014 Jan. 9 Carmi et al. 2011 J. Immunol. 186 3462 3471 doi 10.4049 jimmunol.1002901 Epub 2011 Feb. 7 Chen et al. 2013 Histopathology 63 225 233 doi 10.1111 his.12156 Epub 2013 Jun. 6 .

ROR has also been identified to have a regulatory role in lipid glucose homeostasis and has been implicated in metabolic syndrome obesity Meissburger et al. 2011 EMBO Mol. Med. 3 637 651 hepatosteatosis insulin resistance and diabetes.

Further support for the role of ROR in the pathogenesis of inflammatory metabolic circadian effect cancer and autoimmune diseases and disorders can be found in the following references Chang et al. 2012 J. Exp. Pharmacol. 4 141 148 Jetten et al. 2013 Frontiers Endocrinol. 4 1 8 Huh Littman 2012 Eur. J. Immunol. 42 2232 2237 Martinez et al. 2008 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1143 188 211 Pantelyushin et al. 2012 J. Clin. Invest. 122 2252 2256 Jetten Ueda 2002 Cell Death Differen. 9 1167 1171 Solt et al. 2010 Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 21 204 211.

In light of the role that ROR plays in disease pathogenesis inhibition of ROR activity and Th17 cell differentiation and activity including IL17 production will be of significant therapeutic benefit. It is therefore desirable to prepare compounds that inhibit ROR activity and hence have utility in the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune metabolic circadian effect cancer and other diseases mediated by ROR such as e.g. asthma atopic dermatitis acne Crohn s disease regional enteritis ulcerative colitis Sj gren s syndrome uveitis Behet s disease dermatomyositis multiple sclerosis ankylosing spondylitis systemic lupus erythematosus scleroderma psoriasis psoriatic arthritis steroid resistant asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.

Certain of the disclosed compounds may exist in various stereoisomeric forms. Stereoisomers are compounds that differ only in their spatial arrangement. Enantiomers are pairs of stereoisomers whose mirror images are not superimposable most commonly because they contain an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom that acts as a chiral center. Enantiomer means one of a pair of molecules that are mirror images of each other and are not superimposable. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that contain two or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. The symbol in a structural formula represents the presence of a chiral carbon center. R and S represent the configuration of substituents around one or more chiral carbon atoms. Thus R and S denote the relative configurations of substituents around one or more chiral carbon atoms.

 Racemate or racemic mixture means a compound of equimolar quantities of two enantiomers wherein such mixtures exhibit no optical activity i.e. they do not rotate the plane of polarized light.

 Geometric isomer means isomers that differ in the orientation of substituent atoms in relationship to a carbon carbon double bond to a cycloalkyl ring or to a bridged bicyclic system. Atoms other than H on each side of a carbon carbon double bond may be in an E substituents are on opposite sides of the carbon carbon double bond or Z substituents are oriented on the same side configuration. R S S R E Z cis and trans indicate configurations relative to the core molecule. When a disclosed compound is named or depicted by structure without indicating a particular geometric isomer form it is to be understood that the name or structure encompasses one geometric isomer free of other geometric isomers mixtures of geometric isomers or all geometric isomers.

The compounds of the invention may be prepared as individual enantiomers by either enantio specific synthesis or resolved from an enantiomerically enriched mixture. Conventional resolution techniques include forming the salt of a free base of each isomer of an enantiomeric pair using an optically active acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base forming the salt of the acid form of each enantiomer of an enantiomeric pair using an optically active amine followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free acid forming an ester or amide of each of the enantiomers of an enantiomeric pair using an optically pure acid amine or alcohol followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary or resolving an enantiomeric mixture of either a starting material or a final product using various well known chromatographic methods.
