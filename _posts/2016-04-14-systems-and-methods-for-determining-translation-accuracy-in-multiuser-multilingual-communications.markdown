The present invention s generally relate to language translation and more particularly language translation involving multiple users and multiple languages.

Before the advent of machine based language translations hereafter machine translations translation between two languages was only possible via intervention or interpretation by a person educated in both languages. In contrast typical machine translators generally operate based on statistical stochastic analysis of context and grammar usually without need of human intervention interpretation.

Typical machine translation is often error prone particularly where the text to be translated has a minimal context. Text having minimal context is often found in conversations which employ brief sentence construction. Additionally machine translations often have trouble with abbreviations acronyms diminutives colloquial words phrases proper nouns and common nouns which are also commonly found in conversational text.

Various embodiments described herein provide for systems and methods that relate to multi lingual communications between multiple users possibly where the users are at two or more client systems. Modes of communications facilitated by embodiments may include Internet based chat e.g. Apple iMessage Windows Live Messenger etc. e mail e.g. embedded forum messaging Yahoo mail RFC 5322 etc. text based mobile phone communications e.g. SMS messages or MMS messages postings to online forums e.g. postings to a web based hobby forum and postings to online social media services e.g. Twitter Facebook etc. . For example systems and methods may implement a multi lingual multi user chat system.

For some embodiments the method provided comprises identifying a first language and a second language receiving an initial message in the first language from a first person at a first chat client system who communicates in the first language and querying a data store for a first corresponding message in the second language that is based on the initial message in the first language. If the data store includes the first corresponding message the method may then assist in sending the corresponding message to a second person at a second chat client system who communicates in the second language. Depending on the embodiment the initial message may comprise text an emoticon. ASCII based art or other content suitable or customary for a human readable message sent over a network. Additionally the initial message may be part of a larger message being communicated between chat client systems e.g. the initial message is one sentence in a multi sentence message .

If the data store does not include the first corresponding message the method may utilize a transformation engine to attempt to transform at least a portion of the initial message to a transformed message in the first language. Using the transformed message the method may then query the data store for a second corresponding message in the second language that is based on the transformed message.

For certain embodiments the system or method may attempt transforming the initial message using a series of transformation operations before querying the data store is queried for a second corresponding message that is based on the transformed message. Alternatively in some embodiments the system or method may perform the transformation and query iteratively whereby the initial message is transformed using a subset of available transformation operations the data store is queried for a second corresponding message based on the resulting transformed message and if a second corresponding message is not identified another iteration of transformation and query is performed e.g. the resulting transformed message is further transformed using another subset available transformation operations and the data store is queried for a second corresponding message based on the resulting transformed message . In some such embodiments the subset of transformation operations applied in each iteration may be applied to the initial message or may be applied to the latest resulting transformed message.

Eventually the method may assist in translating the initial message or the transformed message to a corresponding message in the second language. In some embodiments the initial message may be translated to the corresponding message when the first corresponding message for the initial message is not in the data store and the transformation engine does not transform at least a portion of the initial message. Additionally in various embodiments the transformed message may be translated to the corresponding message when the first corresponding message for the initial message is not in the data store the transformation engine results in a transformed message that contains the transformation of at least a portion of the initial message and the data store does not include the second corresponding message for the transformed message.

Depending on the embodiment transforming the portion of the initial message may comprise identifying a chatspeak word or phrase e.g. lol gr8 in the initial message and replacing the chatspeak word or phrase with a non chatspeak word or phrase performing a spelling check on the portion of the initial message or identifying an abbreviation in the portion of the initial message and replacing the abbreviation with a word or a phrase corresponding to e.g. represented by the abbreviation e.g. CA with California or brb to be right back .

In addition transforming the portion of the initial message may comprise identifying an acronym in the portion of the initial message and replacing the acronym with a word or a phrase corresponding to e.g. represented by the acronym e.g. USA or identifying a colloquial word or phrase in the portion of the initial message and replacing the colloquial word or phrase with a word or a phrase representing the colloquial word or phrase. Furthermore transforming the portion of the initial message may comprise identifying a profane word or phrase in the portion of the initial message and replacing the profane word or phrase with a non profane word or a phrase e.g. that is representative of the profane word or phrase or removing the profane word or phrase from the initial message.

For some embodiments transforming the portion of the initial message comprises flagging the portion of the initial message to not be translated. For instance wherein a certain portion of the initial message comprises a proper noun a common noun a diminutive an abbreviation or an acronym the method may flag that certain portion such that it is not translated in subsequent operations.

Elements of embodiments described with respect to a given aspect of the invention may be used in various embodiments of another aspect of the invention. For example it is contemplated that features of dependent claims depending from one independent claim can be used in apparatus and or methods of any of the other independent claims.

Other features and aspects of various embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of such embodiments.

Various embodiments described herein relate to and facilitate multi lingual communications. The systems and methods of some embodiments may enable multi lingual communications through different modes of communications including for example Internet based chat e.g. Apple iMessage Windows Live Messenger etc. e mail e.g. embedded forum messaging Yahoo mail RFC 5322 etc. text based mobile phone communications e.g. SMS messages or MMS messages postings to online forums e.g. postings to a web based hobby forum postings to online social media services e.g. Twitter Facebook etc. and the like. Certain embodiments may also be used to translate transcripts of communications or conversations that took place in the past e.g. deposition transcripts or chat history . Various embodiments may implement communications systems and methods that translate text between two or more languages e.g. spoken while handling accommodating for one or more of the following in the text specialized domain related jargon e.g. chatspeak abbreviations acronyms proper nouns common nouns diminutives colloquial words or phrases and profane words or phrases. For example some systems and methods described herein may be utilized in connection with a chat system such as those used in massive multiplayer online MMO games which tend to have users that chat in different foreign languages. Through certain embodiments the chat dialogue between two or more users can be transparently translated and presented to each user in their respective native language or language of choice. Additionally through the use of a multi tiered multi module transformation process certain embodiments may facilitate faster translation of communication between two or more users e.g. in their respective native languages than otherwise possible by traditional translation systems alone e.g. translation in a matter of microseconds .

According to some embodiments a system or method may perform translation from chatspeak in a first language such as English to chatspeak in a second language such as French. In another example a system or method may perform transformation from chatspeak in the first language e.g. English to formal speak in the first language e.g. English before attempting translation to the second language e.g. French . Some embodiments may achieve such text translations by first querying a data store e.g. translations cache which may contain translations manually entered by a human operator or translations based on previously performed by a translation system e.g. historical translations performed by an embodiment . Embodiments may attempt to transform one or more portions of the text e.g. process one or more of the following within the text chatspeak acronyms abbreviations proper nouns common nouns colloquialisms and profanity to make it more suitable for accurate text translation. For example certain embodiments may transform a given text to account for current or past idiomatic language use across different languages. Embodiments may reattempt querying the data store after transformation of the portions of the text. If this translation lookup reattempt fails embodiments may attempt to translate the text which may have been transformed using a machine translation service e.g. third party cloud based translation service such as Google translate .

Embodiments may attempt to transform a translated piece of formal text to chatspeak in the new language e.g. transform French formal speak to French chatspeak to further refine the translation of the text eventually produced. Accordingly certain embodiments facilitate chat translation between chatspeak in a first language e.g. English to chatspeak in a second language e.g. Russian French Spanish Chinese Hindi etc. .

Some embodiments may help reduce or avoid the need for using machine translations thereby reducing time cost and other overhead associated with machine translations and may facilitate accurate translations of text having minimal context or comprising short sentence structure. Where the machine translation is facilitated by a third party service or over a secure network connection e.g. Secure Socket Layer SSL connection the cost or overhead avoided by certain embodiments may be significant.

As understood herein transformation means manipulating a first text segment in a first language to form a second text segment in the first language. The resulting second text segment may also be referred to herein as the transformed text. Translation will be understood to mean converting a text segment in a first language to a corresponding text segment in a second language.

As also understood herein a transformed translation means translation of a text segment from a first language to a second language that has already been transformed in accordance with embodiments described herein e.g. transformed from chatspeak text in a first language to formal text in the first language . An untransformed translation will be understood to mean a translation of a text segment from a first language to a second language before the text segment has been transformed in accordance with embodiments described herein.

Various embodiments may implement different transformation translation strategies with certain strategies being well suited for particular translation applications. For example for particular chat system applications the transformation strategy implemented may comprise applying the following set of transformation related modules in the order listed chatspeak module acronym module proper noun module common noun module colloquialism module spelling check module abbreviation module and profanity module. Generally the transformation translation strategy employed determines which transformation operations are performed when the transformation operations are performed in the overall translation process e.g. transformation performed before or after machine translation or in what order the transformation operations are performed e.g. precedence or priority of transformation operations . The transformation translation strategy may also determine what translations are pre populated into the data store e.g. translations can be stored in a translation cache to speed up the overall process and when translation caches are utilized in the overall translation process. For certain embodiments the transformation translation strategy employed may be dynamically determined based on the conditions of the environment in which the embodiments are used. For example where a chat system is experiencing a heavier load of users than usual the transformation translation strategy may switch to one that lessens the processing burden of the chat system e.g. relies more on machine translations rather than on the data store .

Each of the clients the chat server and the translation server may be implemented using one or more digital devices which may be similar to the digital devices discussed later with respect to . For instance the client may be any form of computing device capable of receiving user input e.g. configured for user interaction capable of providing a client user interface that facilitates communications with one or more other clients e.g. any of clients through N and capable of communicating with the chat server through the computer network . Such computing devices may include a mobile phone a tablet computing device a laptop a desktop computer personal digital assistant a portable gaming unit a wired gaming unit a thin client a set top box a portable multi media player or any other type of network accessible user device known to those of skill in the art. Further one or more of the chat server and the translation server may comprise of one or more servers which may be operating on or implemented using one or more cloud based services e.g. System as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS or Infrastructure as a Service IaaS .

The clients may be configured to communicatively connect with the chat server which provides or otherwise facilitates chat sessions between the clients . Each of the clients through N may comprise a chat client system through N respectively that enables a user at each of the clients to access to the chat session through the chat server . Additionally depending on the embodiment each of the chat client systems through N hereafter collectively referred to as chat client systems or chat client system may be implemented as a standalone chat application as a chat feature embedded in non chat application e.g. video game or through a chat service accessible at the client through a web browser. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the chat client systems may be non heterogeneous with respect to one another and still be capable of establishing a chat session between them. The chat client systems may be capable of receiving chat input e.g. a chat message from their respective users in a language and corresponding character set selected by the user e.g. based on user settings or preferences and transmitting the chat input to the chat server to be relayed to another user e.g. another user at another chat client system . The chat client systems may also be capable of receiving chat output e.g. chat session dialogue from the chat server e.g. from another user at another chat client system and displaying the received chat output in a language and corresponding character set selected by the user e.g. based on user settings or preferences .

Through the use of some embodiments the translation of the chat dialogue may be transparent to the users as dialogue is passed between the chat client systems . Accordingly for some embodiments all chat dialogue presented at a given chat client system may be in a language native to or selected by the user at that given chat client system irrespective of what language is being by users at other chat client systems that are contributing to the same chat dialogue. For example where the user at the chat client system and the user at the chat client system are contributing to the same chat dialogue i.e. involved in the same chat session the user at the chat client system may have chosen to enter and receive chat dialogue in English while the user at the chat client system may have chosen to enter and receive chat dialogue in Russian. Though the users at the client systems and will see the same chat content the chat dialogue will be presented in their respectively chosen languages.

As shown the chat server may comprise a chat host system configured to established and or facilitate chat sessions between the chat client systems and a communication transformation and translation CTT system configured to perform transformation and or translation operations in accordance with the various systems and methods described herein. For some embodiments the chat client systems may establish a chat session with each other through the chat host system and the chat host system may utilize the features of the CTT system in facilitating the transparent translation of chat dialogue between the chat client systems . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the chat host system and the CTT system may be part of separate servers and that the entity operating the chat host system may be different from the entity operating the CTT system . For instance the chat host system may be a third party chat host system that utilizes the services of the CTT system .

As also shown the translation server may comprise a translation module configured to receive and service requests for machine text translation. In accordance with some embodiments the CTT system may utilize the operations services of the translation module in performing machine translations of texts. The CTT system may use of one or more translation application programming interfaces APIs to obtain access to the services provided by the translation module . Depending on the embodiment the translation module and the server on which it resides may be operated by a third party such as Google which may offer the machine translation services free of charge or for a fee. Though the translation module is shown to be a component operating on a server separate from the CTT system those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the translation module may operating on the same server as the CTT system and or may be an integrated component of the CTT system .

The CTT communications module may be configured to facilitate communications between the CTT system and systems and components external to the CTT system such as the chat server and or the translation server . Accordingly through the CTT communications module the CTT system may receive the chat dialogue comprising one or more chat messages to be transformed or translated by the CTT system and may output the translated chat dialogue that results from the CTT system .

The language module may be configured to identify the one or more languages used in connection with chat dialogue received by the CTT system . For some embodiments the language module may identify the language through analysis of the content of the chat dialogue received and or obtaining language preference settings information from the respective chat client systems e.g. chat client systems involved with the chat dialogue received.

The transformation module may be configured to perform transformation operations on chat dialogue comprising one or more chat messages received by the CTT system in accordance with some systems and methods described herein. In accordance with some embodiments the transformation operations performed by the transformation module may include without limitation those relating to chatspeak acronyms abbreviations proper nouns common nouns colloquialisms and profanity. Additional details of the transformation module are discussed in .

The translation data store may be configured to store and subsequently provide previously translated text to the CTT system as the CTT system performs transformed translations and untransformed translations in accordance with the some system and methods described herein. As described herein the translation data store may operate as a cache for translations previously performed by the CTT system and or may store translations manually entered and stored by a human operator e.g. by way of a translation training system . For some embodiments the translation data store may be populated with translations that would speed up the performance of the CTT system with respect to certain chat contexts. For example where the CTT system is utilized in conjunction with a chat system associated with an MMO game the translation data store may be populated e.g. by the operator of the CTT system with transformed and untransformed translations relating specifically to the MMO game. For certain embodiments the multi tiered multi module approach of transforming text used by the transformation module is particularly well suited for handling chat text in MMO games which by nature tends to be complex.

Depending on the embodiment the data store may store either untransformed translations e.g. you vous transformed translations e.g. u vous or both. For some embodiments the translation data store may store translations such that corresponding chat messages may be identified using hash values tags. For instance to store a Spanish translation for an original message in English the Spanish translation may be stored based on a hash value of the English message thereby enabling the Spanish translation to be later located and obtained using the hash value of the English message. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some embodiments the translation data store may comprise a separate data store for translations between two specific languages. Accordingly when a chat message is being transformed translated between English and French a corresponding data English French data store may be utilized for operations relating to the translation data store .

The translation API module may be configured to provide the CTT system with access to machine translation services provided external to the CTT system e.g. by the translation module of the translation server . As described herein the translation API module may be utilized by the CTT system when a translation is not located in the translation data store .

The chatspeak module may be configured to identify one or more words or phrases in a chat message that are associated with chat jargon i.e. chatspeak and may be further configured to suggest replacement e.g. corresponding formal i.e. non chatspeak words or phrases for the identified words or phrases.

The chat client communications module may be configured to facilitate communications between the chat client system and systems and components external to the chat client system such as the chat server . Accordingly through the chat client module the chat client system may receive from the chat server the chat dialogue to be presented at the chat client system e.g. via the chat client GUI module and may send to the chat server the chat dialogue received from the user at the chat client system e.g. via the chat client GUI module .

The chat client GUI module may be configured to provide a user at the chat client system with graphical input output access to chat sessions with other chat client systems. Accordingly for some embodiments the chat client GUI module may present a user at the client with a client GUI adapted for receiving user interactions through the client . For some embodiments the chat client GUI module may be configured to present the user with chat dialogue e.g. as they are received from the chat server in the language of their choice e.g. according to the user language preferences settings . Additionally the chat client GUI module may be configured to receive chat input from the user in the language of their choice e.g. according to the user language preferences settings . As described herein the language used in presenting and receiving the chat dialogue at the chat client system may be different from the language used in presenting and receiving the chat dialogue at another chat client system. More regarding the chat client GUI module is discussed with respect to .

The method may start at operation the language module of the CTT system may being by identifying a first language being used by a user at a first chat client system e.g. and a second language being used by a user at a second chat client system e.g. . According to some embodiments the language module may identify the first language and the second language by obtaining language preferences settings from the respective chat client system .

At operation the CTT communications module of the CTT system may receive an initial message in the first language. In some embodiments the CTT communications module may receive the initial message from the chat host system which may have received the initial message from a chat client system e.g. .

At operation the CTT control module of the CTT system may query the translation data store for a corresponding message in the second language that corresponds to the initial message. At operation the CTT control module may determine if a corresponding message is found in the translation data store . If one exists at operation the CTT communications module may assist in sending the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. the chat client system . In some embodiments the corresponding message may be sent to the chat host system which may relay the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. . The method may then end.

If a corresponding message does not exist in the translation data store at operation the transformation module may attempt to transform at least a portion of the initial message to a transformed message in the first language. As described herein the message that results from the transformation module may be transformed or may remain unchanged e.g. when transformation operations of the transformation module are not applied to the initial message . For some embodiments the transformation module may perform two or more transformation operations on the initial message in parallel and in response each of the two or more transformation operations may return a separate response from which the transformation module may then select one transformed message for further processing e.g. to be used in operation . Depending on the embodiment each response may comprise a flagged text portion a suggested replacement or a word or phrase inserted into the initial message. Thereafter the transformed message selected may be according to a priority of selection which can determine which transformed message is selected for further processing and according to what precedent. In some embodiments the priority selection may be according to which transformation operation is most likely to generate a transformed message suitable for a subsequent lookup in the translation data store or for subsequent machine translation. Additionally in some embodiments the priority of selection may be according to which transformation operation generates the most formal transformed message. The priority of selection may depend on the transformation translation strategy selected by the embodiment.

At operation assuming the transformation module transformed the message the CTT control module of the CTT system may query the translation data store for a corresponding message in the second language that corresponds to the transformed message. At operation the CTT control module may determine if a corresponding message is found in the translation data store . If one exists at operation the CTT communications module may assist in sending the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. the chat client system . In some embodiments the corresponding message may be sent to the chat host system which may then relay the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. . The method may then end.

For some embodiments if a corresponding message still does not exist in the translation data store at operation the CTT control module may determine if there are any additional transformation operations of the transformation module to perform on the chat message that have not already been performed.

If an additional transformation operation exists the method returns to operation and performs additional transformation operation s . Depending on the embodiment the additional transformation operation s may involve applying a transform operation different from those already performed on the initial message by the transformation module may involve applying the same transformation operations performed but to different portions of the English chat message or may involve some combination thereof. For example if during the first execution of operation the transformation module applies a chatspeak related operation to the initial message to create a first transformed message during a second execution of operation the transformation module may apply an abbreviation related operation to the second transformed message. Following a subsequent execution of operation the method may continue to operations and where the CTT control module may re query the translation data store for a corresponding message in the second language that corresponds to the latest resulting transformed message and the CTT control module may determine if a corresponding message is found in the translation data store . By performing the transformation and query operations in this iterative manner certain embodiments may be able to find a corresponding message before having to perform every transformation operation available. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for certain embodiments the transformation and query operations may be performed in series with the query operation e.g. operation only being performed after every available transformation operation provided by the transformation module has been performed on the chat message.

If a corresponding message does not exist in the translation data store and an additional transformation operation of the transformation module does not exist at operation through the translation API module the translation module may assist in the translating the initial message or the transformed message to a corresponding message in the second language. Subsequently at operation the CTT communications module may assist in sending the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. the chat client system . According to some embodiments the corresponding message may be sent to the chat host system which may then relay the corresponding message to the second chat client system e.g. . The method may then end.

For certain embodiments the transformation module may be utilized to transform the corresponding message in the second language before the corresponding message is sent to the chat host system . As described herein the corresponding message may be submitted for further transformation processing to further refine the translation for the user at the second chat client system e.g. . For example if the initial message contains chatspeak in the first language e.g. English additional transformation processing can add to the extent possible chatspeak in the second language.

In accordance with some embodiments the message that ultimately results from the transformation module e.g. the eighth intermediate message resulting from operation may subsequently be used to query the translation data store for a corresponding message which can serve as a translation for the resulting message. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some instances the message resulting from the transformation module e.g. message subsequently used in the query to the translation data store may be the same as the initial message received e.g. at operation when no transformation has been applied to the initial message e.g. the initial message passes through operations without any transformations being applied .

Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that various embodiments may perform more or less operations than the ones shown may perform operations different from those shown and may perform operations in a different order. Generally the types of transformation operations performed and the order in which they are performed may be depend on transformation strategy employed by the embodiments. As noted herein various embodiments may implement different transformation translation strategies in achieving their respective translations with certain strategies being well suited for particular translation applications or translation contexts. The transformation translation strategy employed may determine which transformation operations are performed when the transformation operations are performed or in what order the transformation operations are performed. The transformation translation strategy may also determine what translations are populated into a translation data stores and when a translation data store is utilized in the overall transformation translation process.

For some embodiments the intermediate messages resulting from operations in the method may have an impact and or cascading effect on messages that result from subsequent operations in the method . Additionally for some embodiments when a chat message is processed by the method each operations of flow chart may be performed on the chat message before the method concludes. Alternatively for some embodiments the method of flowchart may terminate early upon the performance of only a subset of the operations shown e.g. after at least one operation results in a transformation of the chat message . According to some embodiments the performance of each operation in flowchart may be followed by a query to the translation data store for a corresponding message in the desired language based on the latest resulting transformed message in the event a corresponding message is identified the method of flowchart may terminate early.

For various embodiments the method may perform operations in parallel. For example the CTT control module may submit the initial message to two or more operations in parallel and receive from each of those two or more operations a separate response. Each response may comprise a flagged text portion a suggested replacement or a word or phrase inserted into the initial message. Thereafter the CTT control module may select one of the received responses for subsequent processing e.g. query a translation data store or translating by the translation module possibly according to a priority of selection e.g. which can determine which transformed message is selected for further processing and according to what precedent .

For instance during the method the CTT control module may submit an initial message to operation for identifying chatspeak processing operation for common noun processing and operation for abbreviation processing. In response operation may return the initial message transformed for chatspeak operation may return the initial message unchanged and operation may return the initial message transformed for abbreviations. Subsequently based on a priority of selection the CTT control module may select the transformed message returned from operation for further processing.

For certain embodiments a time limit may be enforced on performing various operations in the method . The time limit may cause a transformation operation of method to stop performing if a response result is not received before the time limit has expired. In doing so various embodiments may ensure that certain transformation operations do not unnecessarily hinder the overall transformation translation process.

Though the operations of the above method may be depicted and described in a certain order those skilled in the art will appreciate that the order in which the operations are performed may vary between embodiments. Additionally those skilled in the art will appreciate that the components described above with respect to the method of the flowchart are merely examples of components that may be used with the method and for some embodiments other components may also be utilized in some embodiments.

As used herein feedback should be understood to refer to user feedback or user feedback response possibly in response to a query requesting feedback for a transformation or a translation. It should also be understood that that user feedback can comprise user feedback for a transformation or user feedback for a translation. User feedback may comprise a definition for a given word or phrase that i permits the given word or phrase to be transformed from the given word or phrase in a first language to a corresponding word or phrase in the same first language ii permits the given word or phrase to be transformed from the given word or phrase in the first language to a corresponding word or phrase in a different second language thereby performing a transformed translation of the word or phrase and or iii permits the given word or phrase to be translated from a first language to a second language thereby performing a untransformed translation of the word or phrase. As described herein a user feedback response may be received in response to a query requesting user feedback in connection with a translation failure.

As used herein a failure of translation or a translation failure may be understood to include an actual failure to translate a text e.g. translated text is identical to the original text or text translations that are flagged as potentially containing a translation failure e.g. flagged by a user reading a translated text and believing the translated text contains questionable or incorrect translation .

As shown in the CTT system may comprise a communication transformation and translation CTT control module a communication transformation and translation CTT communications module a language module a transformation module a translation data stores and a translation application programming interface API module In some embodiments the CTT control module the CTT communications module the language module the transformation module the translation data stores and the translation API module may be similar to the components of the CTT system as described herein.

As also shown in the CTT system may comprise a translation failure management module a user feedback UF query generation module a user feedback UF query audience selection module a query response valuation module a query application program interface API module a response evaluation module a translation data store update module an audience competence evaluation module and an incentive reward module .

The translation failure management module may be configured to facilitate management of translation failures e.g. failure to translate a text from a first language to a second language . For some embodiments the translation failure management module may be adapted to handle one or more translation failures that may be experienced by the CTT system as the system attempts to translate a chat message sent from a first user who is using a first language during their chat sessions to a second user who is using a second language during their chat session. As described herein the text to be translated by the CTT system may be chat messages which may comprise chatspeak abbreviates colloquialisms idioms and the like. It will be understood that during transformation or translation of a chat message some or all of the chat messages may result in translation failure possibly due to the inability of the CTT system to transform and or translate those failure causing portions of the chat message.

Features provided by the translation failure management module may include without limitation automatically detecting when a failure to translation of text has occurred automatically detecting when certain words or phrases of a text are untranslatable enabling a user to flag some or all of a translated text as containing actual or potential translation errors after a translation process managing what translations failures are selected for user feedback from various audience members e.g. chat members such as players using an in game chat system managing what words or phrases associated with a translation failure are selected for user feedback e.g. based on how often the word is encountered used in text to be translated and managing when a translation failure is no longer a candidate for selection for user feedback e.g. words or phrases associated with a translation failure are removed from the selection pool .

In various embodiments the translation failure management module may manage the overall availability of words or phrases for user feedback by audience members. As used herein a user feedback opportunity may comprise a word or phrase available for user feedback by an audience member. The translation failure management module may throttle or suspend availability of one or more user feedback opportunities based on various conditions such as the availability of computing resources for user feedback incentives rewarded in connection with user feedback quality of feedback response received in the past and the like. For instance it may be determined that continuing to reward incentives e.g. in game currency or in game item for approved user feedback responses may negatively impact the economy relating to the incentive e.g. the in game economy . Accordingly some embodiments may temporarily suspend the availability of user feedback opportunities that reward the incentives or adjust the incentives rewarded e.g. amount of incentive or type of incentive for user feedback opportunities when those embodiments detect that the current inventive strategy is harmful to an economy of concern e.g. in game economy .

As described herein an audience member from which user feedback is solicited may be one who has volunteered to provide such feedback possibly as a participant in a user feedback program and or in return for an incentive when their submitted feedback has been approved e.g. as being correct accepted or useful in defining a transformation or translation . For some embodiments the user feedback systems described herein may be part of a game system such as an online MMO game where the audience members are game players that choose to otherwise participate in user feedback opportunities possibly for incentives useful in the game system e.g. in game currency or in game items . In this way the user feedback system may be presented as a game feature that game playing audience member regard as a game to be played for a reward thereby leveraging the competition inherent to the gaming environments. More regarding selection of audience members is described with respect to the UF query audience selection module .

As described herein a word or phrase may be flagged by a communications system user that believes that the word or phrase of concern is preventing a translation or causing an inaccurate translation of communicated text. For example in a multi lingual multi user chat system associated with an online game a game player may flag an entire chat message they have received or flag certain portions of the chat message e.g. word or phrase thereof as potentially having a translation problem or failure. Words or phrases associated with a translation failure may include for example specialized domain related jargon abbreviations acronyms proper nouns common nouns diminutives colloquial words or phrases and profane words or phrases. Additionally the word or phrase may be flagged by a system or method that automatically detects the word or phrase as being untranslatable possibly preventing translation of larger phrases or sentences.

The translation management module may be responsible for selecting a word or phrase as being the subject of a user feedback where the selected word or phrase may be flagged as being associated with an actual or potential failure to translate text from a first language to a second language. The translation management module may select a word or phrase based on a number of factors some of which include the current importance of the word or phrase in translations e.g. importance based on overall usage of the word or phrase complexity of the word or phrase e.g. difficulty of the word or phrase or how long the word or phrase has been an issue the competency of the user selected volunteering to provide user feedback e.g. the user has competency in the second language and a preference of the user selected volunteering to provide user feedback. Those skilled in the art will appreciate other factors for selecting words or phrases for user feedback may be utilized by various embodiments.

For various embodiments users selected to provide user feedback may be ones volunteering to provide such feedback. For instance a user may choose to provide user feedback by setting an associated user preference by selecting an in chat system advertisement that is soliciting user feedback and or browsing through a section that lists one or more user feedback opportunities available for selection.

As noted herein the translation failure management may manage when a particular word or phrase that is associated with an actual or potential translation failure is no longer a candidate for selection for user feedback by audience members. Various conditions can lead the translation failure management to make such a determination including for instance when a specific number of feedback responses has been received in connection with the certain word or phrase or with the associated translation failure when a specific number of consistent feedback responses has been received in connection with the certain word or phrase or with the associated translation failure and when a given feedback response has been approved as a valid response for the user feedback sought e.g. a specific response from a set of unique feedback responses has been manually approved by an administrator as a correct response .

The UF query generation module may be configured to generate a query for obtaining user feedback from a selected audience member for a given word or phrase selected for user feedback. As described herein the audience member selected may be a user who has volunteered to provide user feedback possibly in return for an incentive when the user feedback submitted has been approved as being correct an accepted feedback response or useful in refining a translation in question. More regarding selection of audience members is described with respect to the UF query audience selection module .

For some embodiments the query generated may include one or more methods of receiving a query response from the selected audience member. For example the generated query may include as a response method a listing of predefined responses from which the audience member can select as their response to the generated query also referred to herein as a select form response . In another example the generated query may include as a response method one or more fields configured to receive as their response to the generated query a text value entered into a field by the audience member. also referred to herein as a free form response Other response methods may include a graphical user interface GUI elements text values or some combination thereof.

The one or more response methods included in the generated query may be according to a number of factors including for example a preference of the audience member the importance and or complexity of the word or phrase for which user feedback is sought the number of feedback responses received thus far for the word or phrase for which user feedback is sought the number of consistent feedback responses received thus far for the word or phrase for which user feedback is sought and whether there is enough free form feedback responses from which to create a selection form response. For some embodiments the audience member to respond to the generated query can select from two or more response methods for the generated query.

Additionally the languages for which an audience member is presented user feedback opportunities may be according to a number of factors including for example whether the audience member is multi lingual by monitoring the audience member s chat history whether the audience member language abilities meet or exceed a particular language confidence level and a language setting on the user device the audience member is using to participate in a user feedback opportunity e.g. default language setting for the audience member s device . For example where the default device language of an audience member s device is German and he or she selects to participate in a user feedback opportunity the query generated and sent to the audience member will based on the German language e.g. query for defining an English word or phrase to a German word or phrase or vice versa . For some embodiments the generated query may provide an audience member with an option to select the language of the response to be submitted e.g. when the generated query does not specify or require a specific language and or with an option to provide more two or more responses with each response possibly being of a different language. For some such embodiments the audience member may be presented with language response options according to various language factors discussed herein such as whether the audience member is multi lingual and a language setting on the user device of the audience member.

The UF query audience selection module may be configured to select an audience member from which to solicit user feedback. In some embodiments the UF query audience selection module may select the audience member from a pool of audience members who have volunteered to provide user feedback possibly in return of incentive which may be received when the user feedback is approved accepted . As described herein an audience member may volunteer to participate in translation at which time the audience member may be included in the pool of audience members from which the UF query audience selection module selects for user feedback solicitation. In some embodiments when the UF query audience selection module selects an audience member the audience member may be provided with a query generated by the UF query generation module to obtain user feedback. The query generated by the UF query generation module may be provided to the audience member selected by the UF query audience selection module as part of a listing of user feedbacks available for participation by the selected audience member. Once the generated query is provided to the selected audience member the selected audience member may initiate a user feedback session in which the generated query is presented to the audience member e.g. with one or more response methods associated with the generated query and the selected audience member can provide one or more responses e.g. by way of one or more response methods included with the generated query .

Depending on the embodiment where a word or phrase is selected for user feedback before the audience member is selected the audience member may be selected from a set of candidate audience members based on the selected word or phrase e.g. whether the selected word or phrase matches the competency or preferences of the audience member . Alternatively where the audience member is selected before the word or selected is selected for user feedback the word or phrase selected may be based according to the audience member that is selected. The competency of a given audience member may be determined based on one or more feedback responses previously provided by the given audience member e.g. in connection with previous queries generated and provided to the given audience member and or one or more language capabilities of the audience member. An audience member for example may be evaluated to have requisite competency to provide user feedback for one or more words or phrases associated with a translation failure when the audience member has achieved a specific number of approved feedback responses. In another example an audience member may be evaluated to have competency in a specific language based on at least previously submitted feedback responses for a specific language the preferences of the audience member and or information related to the audience member that indicates their fluency in the specific language. In a further example an audience member who has previously submitted feedback responses that were evaluated as being incorrect or fraudulent e.g. nonsensical or fabricated responses may be determined to have lower competency.

For some embodiments once a given audience member has provided a response in connection with a word or phrase and the response is possibly approved the given audience member may not be re selected for providing user feedback for the same word or phrase. Certain embodiments may make an exception to this restriction when the given audience member provides a response in a language that is different from the language of a response previously submitted for the same word or phrase.

Where incentives are provided in return for user feedback e.g. upon approval of a feedback response various embodiments may select audience members based on a quota such as a time based quota e.g. hourly daily monthly yearly limit for submitting feedback responses or an incentives earned quota e.g. limit of in game currency or items awarded for incentive based user feedback where the quota is associated with individual audience members groups of audience members or some combination thereof. For some embodiments the UF query audience selection module may throttle or suspend availability of user feedback opportunities to one or more audience members based on various conditions such as the availability of computing resources for user feedback incentives rewarded in connection with user feedback quality of feedback response received in the past and the like.

The query response QR valuation module may be configured to determine the value or importance of a query or query response based on the word or phrase for which the query or query response is soliciting user feedback. Example of factors considered by various embodiments when determining the value a query or a query response may include the complexity of the word or phrase e.g. higher the complexity higher the value the importance of the word or phrase to transformation translation processes e.g. higher the importance higher the value the response method employed by the query or query response e.g. higher value for a free form response method over a selection form response method the type of word or phrase e.g. chatspeak abbreviation or colloquial or the one or more languages involved e.g. a query comprising an English word or phrase and that receives a French response has higher value than a query comprising an English word or phrase that receives an English response . In some embodiments an incentive rewarded for a given user feedback may be based on the value associated with the query or query response. For some embodiments the QR valuation module may be configured to determine a value for a query or query response based on the efficacy of previous queries or query responses in soliciting beneficial useful or accurate user feedback. Accordingly for some embodiments the value may be dynamically adjusted based on the latest efficacy of achieved by previous queries or query responses. In certain embodiments the QR valuation module may enable an administrator e.g. of the CTT system or another authorized user to manually assign or adjust values for queries and or query responses in connection with one or more user feedback.

The query API module may be configured to facilitate transmitting user feedback queries to selected audience members and or receiving query responses from selected audience members. In some embodiments the query API may be adapted to provide a listing of available user feedback opportunities available to the selected audience member provide queries relating to one or more the user feedback opportunities selected by the selected audience member receiving responses for one or more the user feedback opportunities selected by the selected audience member and or providing the selected audience member with the current status of query responses submitted for approval thus far e.g. status of approved rejected or pending awaiting approval . For some embodiments the query API may obtain one or preferences associated with a given audience member possibly from a chat client system being used by the given audience member to interact with the CTT system . As noted herein a preference associated with an audience member can determine selection of the word or phrase for which user feedback is solicited from the audience member and or can determine of whether the audience member is selected to receive a query for user feedback of a given word or phrase.

The response evaluation module may be configured to evaluate a query response submitted in connection with a query generated to obtain a user feedback. For some embodiments the response evaluation module may evaluate query responses in one or more phases.

During a validation phase the response evaluation module may disposition one or more unique responses submitted for a given generated query as approved or rejected for the given generated query. In some embodiments a unique response submitted in connection with a generated query to obtain user feedback may be considered pending approval until such time as the unique response has been approved as being valid for the word or phrase associated with the generated query or rejected as being invalid for the word or phrase associated with the generated query. As used herein a given unique response may include a set of responses similar but not exactly identical in syntax e.g. different punctuation or spacing a given unique response may be received by way of two or more response methods. A unique response is also referred to herein as a unique query response and a unique user feedback response. Depending on the embodiment more than one unique query response may be approved for a given generated query. For instance more than one unique response may be approved as defining a given word or phrase in connection with user feedback that being sought. Responses may for example be manually validated by an administrator or the like who reviews and dispositions the responses e.g. possibly only the unique responses . Additionally or alternatively responses may be validated by an automatic process which may approve and or reject submitted responses based on their count and or the thresholds associated with response counts. In some embodiments an automatic validation process may filter the top submitted responses for a given word or phrase and provide those top submitted responses to an administrator or the like for review and disposition. The validation phase may be performed by the response evaluation module periodically e.g. based on a schedule or based on a condition e.g. where the number of submitted responses pending approval has met or exceeded a threshold .

For some embodiments where a plurality unique user feedback responses e.g. definitions are provided for a given word or phrase the response evaluation module may automatically and or through manual admin input approve the top ranked unique user feedback response e.g. most popular response from the plurality but may only do so if that top ranked unique user feedback response is statistically significant. For instance where a first unique user feedback response was received twenty six times for a given word and a second unique user feedback response was received twenty four times for the same given word the first unique user feedback response may not be approved as the response for the given word even if it is the top ranked unique user feedback response for the given word. This is because twenty six is not statistically significant over twenty four. The first unique user feedback may not be selected until for example the first unique user feedback response remains the top ranked unique user feedback response and the response count reaches forty.

Given that phrases may be not be identical but may be similar in nature and convey the same intent for some embodiments a word error rate WER may be used to group unique user feedback responses that comprise a phrase. For two phrases WER may measure the substitutions deletions and insertions of words to convey similarity between the phrases.

For various embodiments where a plurality unique user feedback responses e.g. definitions are provided for a given phrase the response evaluation module may automatically and or through manual admin input approve the top ranked unique user feedback response.

During a check phase the response evaluation module may determine whether a response submitted by an audience member has been dispositioned as approved rejected or pending review e.g. pending approval . For some embodiments a data store may maintain the status of whether a unique response submitted by audience members in connection with a given word or phrase has been approved or rejected as a valid definition for the given word or phrase. Accordingly the check phase may determine the disposition of a response submitted for a given word or phrase by consulting with the data store that maintains the disposition status of unique responses previously submitted for the given words or phrase the submitted response shares the disposition status of the unique response that corresponds with the submitted response. Depending on the embodiment the check phase for a submitted response may be performed immediately or soon after the response has been submitted. Where a submitted response is determined to be still pending review during a check phase the check phase may be re performed at a later time possibly following a validation phase that causes the status of the identical or similar submitted responses to be affected. The status of the submitted response may be updated according to the current disposition of the submitted response as determined during the check phase. As described herein the current status of one or more responses submitted by a given audience member may be provided as a listing that reflects the current statuses for those responses. More regarding response status is discussed later with respect to .

The response evaluation module evaluation of the response may comprise determining whether the response is approved. The response may be approved based on at least one previous response provided by another person in response to another query the other query being previously generated to obtain feedback for the word or phrase from the other person. The response may be approved once the response is determined to accurately define the word or phrase.

The translation data store update module may be configured to update a transformation or a translation e.g. stored in the translation data store possibly based on the evaluation of a response submitted by a selected audience member for a user feedback query. For example where a submitted response in a first language is determined during response evaluation as being an approved definition for a given word in the same first language a transformation mapping the given word in the first language to the response in the first language will be added or updated accordingly. In another example where a submitted response in a second language is determined during response evaluation as being an approved definition for a given word in the first language a transformation mapping the given word in the first language to the response in the second language will be added or updated accordingly. The update of transformations or translations may be performed by the translation data store update module during or subsequent to a check phase that results in the disposition of a submitted response changing to approved.

The audience competence evaluation module may be configured to determine the competence of an audience member which may be indicative of the level of confidence associated with the audience member ability to provide accurate and or useful user feedback responses. As described herein the competency of a given audience member may be determined based on one or more feedback responses previously provided by the given audience member e.g. in connection with previous queries generated and provided to the given audience member and or one or more language capabilities of the audience member. An audience member for example may be evaluated to have requisite competency to provide user feedback for one or more words or phrases associated with a translation failure when the audience member has achieved a specific number of approved feedback responses. In another example an audience member may be evaluated to have competency in a specific language based on at least previously submitted feedback responses for a specific language the preferences of the audience member and or information related to the audience member that indicates their fluency in the specific language. In a further example an audience member who has previously submitted feedback responses that were evaluated as being incorrect or fraudulent e.g. gibberish responses may be determined to have lower competency.

The incentive reward module may be configured to reward an audience member with an incentive based on the evaluation of a response submitted by the audience member in connection with a query for user feedback. As described herein upon approval a submitted response an audience member may be rewarded with an incentive. The amount or type of incentive rewarded may be determined based on a number of factors including without limitation the value of the query or query response assigned by the QR valuation module the response method used by the audience member in responding to the query the amount s of incentives already rewarded e.g. to the audience member or to all audience members in connection with the particular word or phrase or through incentive based user feedback the language of the query or the language of the response provided and the type of word or phrase for which a response was submitted e.g. chatspeak abbreviation or special domain word or phrase . The incentive rewarded may comprise real world currency or virtual currency such as in game currency or in game item which may or may not have value outside its related virtual economy e.g. monetary value in a real world economy . For some embodiments the incentive may comprise a real world good or service or a virtual good or service which may have an associated monetary value. Those skilled in the art recognize that other forms of incentives may be rewarded in different embodiments.

For some embodiments the incentive reward module may be responsible for notifying an audience member when one or more of their submitted responses are approved and or when an incentive has been awarded to the audience member for a submitted response that has been approved. In various embodiments the incentive reward module may notify the audience member of the incentive reward through a notification message e.g. in chat message such as a pop up message and or through an update to a listing of statuses for submitted responses.

In the context of the chat client system a chat user of the chat client system can be an audience member with respect to the user feedback systems of various embodiments e.g. the CTT system .

The UF query preferences module may be configured to manage and otherwise permit a chat user to preview defined and or adjust preferences in relation to the user feedback features provided in connection with user feedback systems of some embodiment e.g. the CTT system . Example of preferences managed by UF query preferences module may include for instance language preferences relating to user feedback e.g. language of words or phrases solicited for user feedback and or language of the user feedback sought preferred response methods for user feedback queries e.g. select form responses over free form responses or preferred word or phrase types e.g. abbreviations chatspeak physics related or idioms and the like.

As used herein a select form response is a response that is predetermined and selectable from a listing of two or more select form responses. Depending on the embodiment a listing of select form responses may permit an audience member to select two or more responses when applicable. A free form response is a response that comprises a text based value e.g. character value or string value entered into a field by an audience member.

The UF query GUI module may graphically facilitate the presentation of a query generated for user feedback and provided to a chat user e.g. by the CTT system presentation of one or more response methods associated with the query and or receiving a response from the chat user through the presented response method. The UF query GUI module may also facilitate management of management of preferences through the UF query preferences module . More regarding with the graphical user interfaces that may be presented at a chat client system is described later with respect to .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for various embodiments a client system for user feedback may include more or less components than those illustrated in and each component illustrated in may perform more or less operations than those described for each component.

The undefined words phrases data store may comprise a word or phrase associated with a translation failure and for which user feedback is being sought. The undefined words phrases data store may include with the word or phrase a sample sentence in which the word or phrase is used e.g. word or phrase context a confidence measure that indicates how important the word or phrase is e.g. word importance source language for the word or phrase a target language for the user feedback sought and the like. In some embodiments the word importance of a word or phrase in the undefined words phrases data store may initial equal for all words but gets increased as the word or phrase is encountered and problematic and or untranslatable.

The recorded responses data store may comprise a user feedback response received from an audience member and recorded for a word or phrase included in the undefined words phrases data store . In some embodiments the user feedback response comprises a response received for a query generated to obtain user feedback with respect to the word or phrase. The undefined words phrases data store may include with the recorded user feedback response an identifier for the audience member submitting the user feedback response a timestamp for when the user feedback response was received and or recorded an indication of whether the recorded user feedback response is approved a timestamp for when the recorded user feedback response is approved and the like.

The feedback audience data store may comprise a set of identifiers for audience members that chosen to participate in user feedback for a word or phrase included in the undefined words phrases data store . The feedback audience data store may include with each identifier for an audience member a confidence score that reflects the consistency competency and or confidence of the audience member in providing user feedback responses.

The response approval data store may comprise each unique user feedback response received in connection with a word or phrase included in the undefined words phrases data store . The response approval data store may include with each unique user feedback response an indication of whether the unique user feedback response is an approved response e.g. correct response a rejected response e.g. incorrect response a response pending review e.g. response needing review or a response having some other status. In some embodiments the response approval data store may be employed in determining when a user feedback response received from an audience member and recorded in the recorded responses data store has been approved.

According to some embodiments the translation failure management module may be configured to review chat logs possibly provided by the chat data store and identify one or more words or phrases associated with actual or potential translation failures. In various embodiments the translation failure management module may be configured to exclude those words or phrases defined in the dictionary data store which may comprise a standard dictionary e.g. Oxford dictionary and or a dictionary of words or phrases e.g. chatspeak words or phrases that an embodiment described herein can parse recognize and or handle. Words or phrases identified by the translation failure management module may be added to the undefined words phrases data store thereby enabling those added words and phrases to be selected for user feedback from select audience members.

The translation failure management module may be configured to select one or more words or phrases possibly from the undefined words phrases data store for user feedback. For some embodiments the translation failure management module may select from a set of words or phrases designated as having the highest importance in the undefined words phrases data store e.g. selected from top important words or phrases in the undefined words phrases data store . In some embodiments the translation failure management module may select two or more words or phrases so that an audience member can be provided with a set of two or more user feedbacks from which to choose to respond e.g. enable the audience member to choose those user feedbacks to which they feel most confident responding . The selection process by the translation failure management module from the undefined words phrases data store may be random based on word or phrase importance age of the word or phrase in the undefined words phrases data store a preference of the selected audience member by the UF query audience selection module whether the audience member selected by the UF query audience selection module has already responded to the word or phrase to be selected e.g. determine based on checking the recorded responses data store for the word or phrase to be selected and the like.

The UF query audience selection module may be configured to select one or more audience members possibly from the feedback audience data store from whom user feedback may be sought. As described herein the user feedback may be sought for the words or phrases selected by the translation failure management module possibly from the chat data store . The selection of an audience member from the feedback audience data store may be dependent on the competency level associated with the audience member.

The UF query generation module may be configured to generate one or more queries for the words or phrases selected by the translation failure management module possibly from the undefined words phrases data store for user feedback. As shown the translation failure management module may provide the UF query generation module with the selected words or phrases for which one or more queries are to be generated. As described herein the UF query generation module may consider a number of different factors when generating the query including for instance the preferences of the audience members selected by the UF query audience selection module and the word or phrase selected for user feedback by the translation failure management module . Eventually the UF query generation module may provide the chat client system with the one or more queries generated by the UF query generation module which may have generated a different query for each word selected and provided by the translation failure management module .

Eventually the one or more queries generated by the UF query generation module may be provided to the chat client system which in turn would present the provided queries for selection by a user at the chat client system . Depending on the embodiment the UF query generation module may provide the generated queries to the chat client system or alternatively another component may be responsible for providing the generated queries to the chat client system. Once presented to the generated queries are presented for selection at the client chat system the user at the client chat system may choose to respond to one or more of the presented queries and those responses provided by the chat client system may be added e.g. recorded to the recorded responses data store .

When a response is added to the recorded responses data store some embodiments check the added response may be evaluated by the response evaluation module . As described herein the response evaluation module may evaluate of a response by check the response and disposition the status of a response.

As shown in the response evaluation module comprises a response check module which may be configured to perform a status check of a user feedback response during evaluation of the user feedback response. The response check module may check the status of a user feedback response from the client chat system by retrieving the user feedback response from the recorded responses data store and checking the status of the unique response in the response approval data store that corresponds to the retrieved user feedback response. In doing so the response check module can determine whether a given user feedback response is approved or rejected. The approval status of the retrieved user feedback response in the recorded responses data store may be updated according to the latest status check performed by the response check module . Where the response check module determines that a retrieved user feedback response has been approved the approval status of the retrieved user feedback response in the recorded responses data store may be updated to reflect the approval and to include a timestamp for when the approval status was updated. Eventually the approval reflected in the recorded responses data store for the retrieved user feedback response may result in the incentive reward module rewarding an incentive to the audience member that submitted the approved user feedback response.

If the status of the retrieved translation response is still pending review the response check module may re check the status of the retrieved user feedback response at a later time e.g. according to a predetermined schedule . If the status of the retrieved translation response is rejection the approval status of the retrieved user feedback response in the recorded responses data store may be updated to reflect the rejection.

Where a unique response corresponding to the retrieved user feedback response is not found the retrieved user feedback response can be added to the response approval data store as a unique response for the word or phrase for which the user feedback response was provided e.g. by a user at the chat client system . Additionally where a retrieved user feedback response is added to the response approval data store as a unique response the unique response may have the initial status of pending approval which will remain until such time as the status of the unique response is manually or automatically dispositioned e.g. through the evaluation response module .

As shown in the response evaluation module also comprises a response validator which may be configured to disposition the status a unique user feedback response as being approved rejected or pending approval. As described herein a unique user feedback response submitted in connection with a generated query to obtain user feedback may be considered to be pending approval until such time as the unique user feedback response has been approved as being valid for the word or phrase associated with the generated query or rejected as being invalid for the word or phrase associated with the generated query.

For some embodiments the response evaluation module may be configured to determine when a given word or phrase no longer in need of additional user feedback. The response evaluation module may make such a determination based on such examples of factors as how many unique user feedback response have been approved for the given word or phrase and whether the count of a unique and approved user feedback response has met or exceeded a specific threshold. When a given word or phrase is determined to longer need further user feedback the response evaluation module may be configured to remove the given word or phrase from the undefined words phrases data store thereby removing the word or phrase from future selection e.g. by the translation failure management module for user feedback.

As described herein the incentive reward module may reward an incentive to an audience member once a user feedback response they have provided has been approved as a valid response for the word or phrase for which the user feedback response was provided e.g. by the audience member through the chat client system . The incentive reward module may identify one or more user feedback responses in the recorded responses data store that were recently approved e.g. their approval status were recently updated to reflect the approval and or that were approved since the last time the incentive reward module attempted to identify one or more user feedback responses in the recorded responses data store having an approved status. The incentive reward module may determine when a given user feedback response was last approved based on the approval timestamp included for the user feedback response in the recorded responses data store . For some embodiments once an incentive is rewarded for a translated feedback response in the recorded responses data store the translated feedback response may be removed from the recorded responses data store . Alternatively once an incentive is rewarded for a translated feedback response in the recorded responses data store the translated feedback response may be updated in the recorded responses data store to indicate for instance when an incentive has been rewarded the amount of incentive rewarded the type of incentive rewarded when the audience member was notified of the reward and or how the audience member was notified of the incentive reward.

The screenshot presents a listing of available user feedback opportunities for various words e.g. Skrilla Booty Cray Hecka and Freshness . The screenshot provides an example of a query presented to an audience member to obtain user feedback for the word Skrilla. As shown the query provides an example context in which the word Skrilla is used and also provides a field configured to receive a free form response for the query . An audience member may be led to the screenshot when the user feedback for the word Skrilla is selected by the audience member from the listing of screenshot .

The screenshot presents an example of a query presented to an audience member to obtain user feedback for the various words. As shown the query provides an audience member with the option to skip the process of providing a response to the query . Certain embodiments may avoid inaccurate and or fabricated responses to various user feedback queries by providing an audience member with the option to skip certain user feedback opportunities and or various user feedback queries 

The screenshot provides an example of a query presented to an audience member to obtain user feedback for the phrase Pardon my french. As shown the query provides an example context in which the phrase Pardon my french is used and also provides a field configured to receive a free form response for the query . An audience member may be led to the screenshot when the user feedback for the phrase Pardon my french is selected by the audience member from the listing of screenshot .

The screenshot provides an example of a query presented to an audience member to obtain user feedback for the word Skrilla. Included with the query is a select form responses which lists possible responses from which an audience member can select. The screenshot presents an incentive e.g. 5 gold coins being rewarded by notifications and once a correct response money is selected for the word Skrilla. 

According to some embodiments a select form response method used to obtain user feedback for a given word or phrase may comprise a listing of predefined responses selected from free form responses gathered for the given word or phrase. Accordingly as various audience members provide free form responses for the word Skrilla through the field e.g. A lot of money Cash Money and Really Rich the response collected may be useful in creating a listing of select form responses as shown in the screenshot .

As shown in chat communication i.e. Tru dat bro entered by chat user Aramis in the interface of the first chat client system fails to translate when it is sent to the interface of the second chat client system of chat user tapir. The chat communication i.e. Tru dat bro presented to chat user tapir reflects this translation failure by presenting the original chat communication entered by chat user Aramis and indicating to chat user tapir that the chat communication is the original chat message entered by chat user Aramis. 

The translation failure illustrated by may be one that can benefit from user feedback in accordance with some embodiments. In accordance with some embodiments the translation failure illustrated in may be identified by the translation failure management module and one or more words from the original chat communication i.e. Tru dat bro may be added to the undefined words phrases data store for future selection for user feedback from participating audience members. For example each of words Tru dat and bro may be added to the undefined words phrases data store for future user feedback of each.

In certain embodiments a learning system for data selection is provided in which feedback obtained from users is automated by a machine learning system that has checks and balances for player consistency. The system adds parallel sentences received from players to parallel corpora which can be used to retrain the statistical machine translation SMT systems from time to time.

A chat transformation system may be or include a system that transforms chatspeak to plain speak. For example the chat transformation may transform U r da king a chatspeak message to You are the king a plain speak message . In certain embodiments plain speak refers to ordinary language spoken and or written by ordinary individuals usually outside of the electronic chat environment where chatspeak may predominate. Plain speak tends to be more grammatical than chatspeak.

The learning system may also utilize or include a language translation system that translates one language to another. For example the language translation may translate How are you doing kind sir an English message to Como to va amable se or a Spanish message .

In some embodiments. parallel corpora is understood to mean two texts one in each language aligned in parallel such that line n in one text corresponds to line n in the second translated text. Parallel corpora may also be referred to as training corpora in such contexts.

In various embodiments machine learning is understood to refer to a supervised semi supervised or unsupervised system that can learn from patterns in input data and develop mechanisms to detect transform or predict behavior.

In general building chat transformation systems and language translation systems requires a moderate amount of syntactic rules or a large amount of parallel corpora for statistical learning. The systems and methods described herein generally utilize reliable statistical chat transformation and language translation systems that use parallel corpora. In certain situations however this initial training data set may be limited in its content and scope. For example new chat words are created and added to chat rooms each day. To maintain accurate and reliable transformation and translation systems these new chat words should be augmented into the chat transformation training corpora.

In various embodiments systems and methods are provided for identifying words that are Out of Vocabulary OOV e.g. words that are not present in a given lexicon . Referring to in some embodiments a method is provided for detecting and processing OOV words. At step the OVV words are initially detected by sending them through a translator system such as the CTT system or the CTT system and or one or more modules thereof. When the output from the translator system is same as the input for a given word the translator system indicates a lack of transformability which suggests the word may be OOV. To further evaluate the word as a potential OOV word the systems and methods may determine step whether the word is a new word as opposed to just a misspelled word both of which will appear as OOV. Accordingly words that can be corrected with a spell checker may be considered to be misspelled words rather than OOV words.

Additionally OOV words that frequently appear in chats generally have a higher propensity of being an OOV word e.g. a new chat speak word . For example when a word has been used by users in prior text messages such prior use suggests the word is likely an OOV word. In some embodiments an ensemble of machine learning and language processing methods is used in parallel to detect whether a word is an OOV word step .

Additionally or alternatively Bayesian probabilities may be computed step to provide a statistical probability of when an OOV is a new word rather than a misspelled word. A genuine chatspeak word tends to follow certain words commonly used prior and post the chatspeak word. A spelling error in comparison will have a less consistent distribution of neighboring words. Computing the prior and posterior Bayesian probabilities will help distinguish useful OOV words which could be added to a lexicon from spelling errors which should not be added to a lexicon. For example consider the phrase Wassup how s it going. Wassup is considered an OOV word as it is not present in standard lexicon. But Wassup is almost always followed by the words How s it going or is often used at the beginning of the sentence. This pattern or consistent behavior is captured by Bayesian probabilities. The system may be trained on texts that have misspelled words but no chat words.

Alternatively or additionally machine learning methods such as k means clustering may be used to distinguish step between different kinds of OOV words such as new chat words misspelled words or junk. K means clustering tends to bring out latent similarities between classes of words. Words belonging to a similar topic tend to be clustered together indicating a latent synonymous relationship between them. Consider the example of Wassup how s it going again. Clustering a group of sentences using the k means algorithm reveals a cluster of greeting words such as Hi What s up Hello Hi etc. with Wassup included among them within the cluster. A spelling error by contrast would be placed in the fringes of clusters or not in any defined cluster at all. These latent relationships help distinguish useful OOV words from errors. The syntax and semantics of a sentence may be analyzed to determine what kind of OOV word the sentence includes e.g. a verb noun or adjective .

When the systems and methods detect a new chat word or other OOV word the new chat word may be presented to a human translator to define a chat transformed or language translated version of the new chat word. The transformed or translated version of the new chat word may then be added to the translation lexicon and used by the systems and methods described herein.

As described herein when an incentive is provided for manual translation of chats between languages there is potential for users to fraudulently manipulate the system to take advantage of the incentive e.g. in game currency . The systems and methods described herein are generally tolerant to human translator abilities yet able to detect fraudulent submissions.

When a user of the system acts as a translator the user translates one or more words or sentences into the target language specified. The user commits fraud however when the user gives a false incomplete or improper translation for the sake of gaming the system or for gaining incentive without fulfilling the purpose of the system.

Referring to in certain embodiments the systems and methods described herein utilize a fraud detection module . The fraud detection module detects fraud in incentivized translations by presenting users with both new and old training data e.g. parallel corpora . Old training data corresponds to translations for which the correct answers are known while new training data corresponds to translations for which the correct answers are not known. The percentage of new to old data may be varied to a user over time. For example more old data may be presented initially and then decreased in percentage gradually.

In some embodiments fraud detection is done by checking the accuracy of old data translations received from users. A confidence score is assigned to each user based on this accuracy. Large or sudden shifts in translation accuracies or consistently low accuracies are indicative of fraud or low translation capabilities in a user. Even after establishing confidence in the capabilities of a translator old data is preferably seeded randomly at least 10 20 of the time for periodic fraud checking.

Using this basic structure the fraud detection module may include and or utilize a supervised fraud detection module and or an unsupervised fraud detection module . With the supervised fraud detection module a reporting tool may present the output from each user in for example a user interface with the following fields input sentence presented translation obtained existing known to be true translation current confidence score of the user and a graph showing the variation of the translator s confidence score over time. When reviewing a translation a human supervisor may accept or reject the translation and may adjust the user s confidence score accordingly. The supervisor may remove the user i.e. revoke the user s translation privileges if cumulative reports show fraudulent behavior. Removal of the user or revocation of the user s translation privileges may be performed using a translation privileges module .

Alternatively or additionally the fraud detection module may utilize the unsupervised fraud detection module . With the unsupervised fraud detection module the accuracy of translations may be computed using various metrics such as WER word error rate and BLEU machine translation accuracy metric that compares machine translations with good quality reference translations . Confidence in user translation abilities may be checked for changes or variations e.g. upswings or downswings . Similar sentences presented to one translator may be presented to other independent translators who use the system. Inter translator reliabilities may also be computed. For example collusion may be avoided between translators through random sampling social network analysis e.g. to confirm two translators are not connected socially or do not have a pre existing relationship and by detecting repeated interactions among users in chat sessions and or online gaming. Two users who regularly interact together online e.g. in an online game or chat session may be more likely to engage in collusion. In some embodiments item response theory i.e. a theory used in psycholinguistics and testing theory is used to augment measurement of translator confidence with translator ability. Fraud detection may be performed using item response theory to do unsupervised fraud detection in a translation augmentation system which has an incentive mechanism. Item response theory dictates ways in which the translator accuracy can be measured relative to peers and to themselves over a period of time to measure consistency. Deviations from the norm may be identified with this method. Intra translator reliabilities may also be computed by presenting the same sentence to a translator again after a set period of time. Various thresholds in reliabilities and translator confidences may be set and if a translator s confidence falls below such thresholds the translator may be removed and blocked from the system e.g. the user s translation privileges may be revoked using the translation privileges module . In some implementations translations from high confidence systems are added to the translation pair lexicons.

In various embodiments the systems and methods described herein utilize voice translation or voice recognition technology to translate audible speech in one language to another language for users of a group voice chat system. The systems and methods may be implemented for chatspeak in which a speech to text transcribing system transcribes user chatspeak into text this text is then transformed to plain speak e.g. non chatspeak and translated to a foreign language. A final transformation is then done to produce foreign chat speak which is then outputted to the end user through a foreign language text to speech system. The systems and methods preferably use state of the art speech recognition techniques and statistical machine translation techniques with extremely fast decoders.

In various embodiments the speech recognition module may utilize hidden Markov models dynamic time warping DTW based speech recognition and or neural networks to convert the audible chatspeak text message to the chatspeak text message . Likewise the text to speech module may use speech synthesis to convert the corresponding chatspeak message into the corresponding chatspeak audible message. The speech synthesis may utilize or include concatenative synthesis e.g. unit selection synthesis diphone synthesis and or domain specific synthesis formant synthesis articulatory synthesis HMM based synthesis and or sinewave synthesis as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.

An important aspect of creating such a speech processing system involves collecting speech samples from multiple accents and dialects for languages that may be processed. The nature of the speech data may include chatspeak and plain speak formats of each language so as to maintain relevance of the system to the domain the system addresses. The incentivized feedback mechanism described herein may be used to transcribe these speech samples which may in turn be used to train the speech recognition module and or the text to speech module . Domain adaptation techniques may be used to substitute data points where sparse. This may be needed in the case of chatspeak speech samples where data tends to be sparse. For example speech data collected in a game domain e.g. for an online game can be substituted with plain speak data that is abundantly available. Domain adaptation preferably includes identifying rules that govern minor speech variations from chat plain speak in a given language e.g. rules that govern the conversion from chatspeak to plain speak or from plain speak to chatspeak in the given language . A plain speak sentence which does not have speech samples in the chatspeak equivalent can then be converted to chatspeak using these domain level rules. A user feedback loop may be used to tune the acoustic model parameters e.g. for the speech recognition module and or the text to speech module to a level that makes the acoustic model domain specific and hence more accurate. For example when the speech recognition module consistently has difficulty with a particular accent additional audible samples of various words may be provided e.g. by users to the system in that accent. This will help the speech recognition module learn how to better recognize words spoken with the accent.

As mentioned embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are used to translate text or chat messages from a group chat environment into different languages. Archiving such translated chats may lead to a very large number of texts in different languages to be persisted into a repository.

Referring to in certain embodiments to reduce storage requirements and facilitate review of chat histories by users a chat history module is used to translate chat histories in real time as the chat histories are browsed by users. The chat history module includes a chat storage module e.g. a register or other storage device for storing chat histories from the various users. The chat history module also includes a chat history transformation module that transforms a text message before and or after the text message is translated to a different language. For example the chat history transformation module may perform a real time transformation of a chat history text message from chatspeak to formal speak or plain speak. In some embodiments the chat history transformation module is the same as or similar to the transformation module . The chat history module also includes a chat history translation module which may be used to perform a real time translation of a chat history text message e.g. in formal speak or plain speak to a different language e.g. from French to English . The chat history translation module may be or include other modules or components described herein such as the language module and or the translation data store .

Once the user is done reviewing a chat history any transformed and or translated text generated by the chat history module may be deleted or removed from memory. This reduces storage requirements for the systems and methods. If the user wishes to review the chat history at a later time the chat history module may be used again to transform and translate the text in the chat history as required.

In certain embodiments the chat history module translates a chat history for a user in real time. The chat history module receives a request from a user to review a history of text messages from a chat session. The chat history module receives from the chat history storage module the history of text messages which includes text messages in a plurality of languages. The chat history transformation module and the chat history translation module are then used to transform and or translate an initial portion of the chat history as required into a language used by the user. After viewing the translated first portion of the chat history the user may wish to view a different portion of the chat history. The chat history module may then receive a request from the user to view the different portion of the history of text messages. The chat history transformation module and the chat history translation module are then used to transform and or translate the different portion of the chat history as required into a language used by the user. The chat history module preferably performs the transformations and or translations in real time as the user scrolls through the chat history.

In certain instances scrolling through chat history presents a problem of scale and data storage. Offering infinite scrolling of chat history presents a problem of fast real time access of data spanning multiple databases and multiple users. This may be done by spawning multiple processes in parallel that fetch historical messages from all users present in a chat room. Translation and associated chat transformations on these messages may be done in parallel as the messages are fetched from the data storage. The resultant output realized by the end user is that of a seamless transition from one screen of chats to the next where data lookup from the database has already been done. This can go on for an infinite number of screens as the systems and methods described herein may have no limitations on data storage and parallel computation may be recycled between processes that were spawned earlier.

In some instances users of the systems and methods described herein may wish to avoid interacting with certain other users in group chat or gaming environments. In previous chat systems the banning and silencing of chat users is typically dealt with by administrators or moderators of a chat server. Embodiments of the systems and methods described herein however allow users to have direct control over who is able to send the users chat messages and or chat contact invitations. For example user A may be allowed to block user B so that user A no longer sees communications from user B in any chat room and or user A no longer receives personal chat contact i.e. single chat invitations from user B.

In various implementations an alliance is a group of players in a game e.g. a multiplayer online game who can group together as a unit to enhance gameplay. Each alliance preferably has a chat room for itself where members of the alliance can talk or send text messages to one another. This presents a need to block certain users from an alliance chat room at times.

In some instances the complexity of the system is brought in or reduced by the scale at which blocking and unblocking is executed. Parallel computation may provide the flexibility to execute the blocking and unblocking at real time without the disadvantages of time lag seen in traditional systems. For example parallel processing may be used to translate and or transform text messages in a text message chat system. A separate parallel process may be assigned to each user of a chat session and or each language being used in the chat session. Such parallel processing may simplify the task of blocking and unblocking users. For example separate parallel processes may be removed or added from the chat system as users are blocked or unblocked respectively.

Automated translation services are not always accurate and may benefit occasionally from human intervention to correct certain errors. In some implementations the translation systems and methods described herein allow users to identify translation errors and offer corrections to fix these errors. For example a bilingual or foreign language user e.g. a French player of an online game may view a chat window and see a translation e.g. to or from French that is incorrect. The user may submit a suggested correction for the erroneous translation and the user may be rewarded e.g. with in game currency or virtual items for submitting the correction.

In certain implementations an original text message and a corresponding translation are displayed on a single screen which provides an opportunity for someone experienced in the languages to provide feedback on the translation instantly. For example a user may recognize a translation error and select an option to submit a corrected translation. The user may then enter and submit the corrected translation and may receive a reward if and when the corrected translation is approved. Upon submitting the corrected translation the user may be prevented from submitting an additional corrected translation for the original message. A user may therefore be unable to earn multiple rewards from a single erroneous translation.

In some instances the systems and methods are unable to translate an original message because the original message was not entered correctly by a user. For example shows an original Spanish message that recites Eres el peor An automated English translation of this message is shown in and recites You are the best Referring to a user may recognize that the original message was not entered in proper Spanish which resulted in an incorrect translation. To address this error the user may select a correct translation button which causes a correction window to open where the user may enter a correction for the original message. Referring to in this case the user enters Ustedes son los mejores in the correction window and selects a submit button . A confirmation window appears informing the user that the submission will be processed. Closing the confirmation window returns the user to the original chat page.

Referring to a user interface is provided that allows users to review translation corrections received from other users. Users who review the translation corrections may be rewarded for their efforts and may be able to select the particular type of reward they receive e.g. virtual goods or currency for an online game . In general after a translation correction is submitted by a user other users can decide whether the correction is better than the original translation and any other translation corrections that have been submitted by other users. When a user s translation is judged to be the best translation that user may receive an award and the user s translation may be added to the translation dictionary e.g. the translation data store . Users who participate in judging the various translations may also receive a reward. Such rewards however may be given only to those users who select the translation correction that was chosen to be the best by all of the judges.

In general by allowing users to submit suggested translation corrections and to judge other users submissions the systems and methods take advantage of feedback that users are willing to give freely. The data collected in this process once approved may be used to correct translation cache entries thereby improving the overall translation capabilities of the systems and methods described herein. This may ensure that the correct translation is shown in the future when the original message is submitted again for translation.

In a typical implementation there are two types of users who may submit and or judge translation corrections users who are monolingual and users who are bilingual. Bilingual users are generally able to understand the original language sentence and provide a more accurate translation in a different language. By contrast monolingual users may not understand the original language phrase but are nonetheless able to review the translation which is presented in the user s device language and submit a correction in exchange for a reward. The translations obtained from the two types of users tend to differ in content with bilingual users generally providing a more accurate translation. The systems and methods are preferably able to determine or detect whether a user is monolingual or bilingual and the user s feedback may be weighed according to that determination. For example users may be able to identify themselves to the systems and methods as being either monolingual or bilingual.

In certain situations most of the users are monolingual and speak the same language English . With a large supply of speakers of one language there are generally more users to submit translation corrections for that language and there is generally less demand for translation corrections to or from that language. To stimulate the supply of translation corrections for other languages users may be rewarded according to the demand for translation corrections. For example when a majority of users speak one language and there is no shortage of translation corrections given in that language such users may receive a smaller reward e.g. 75 of the nominal amount for submitting translation corrections. At the same time a minority of users who speak a different language may receive a larger reward e.g. 125 of the nominal amount due to a greater demand for translation corrections in that different language.

The number of translations a user may correct over a given time period e.g. one day may or may not be limited. There may be no limit on the number of translation corrections for example when no reward is given for submitting the corrections. On the other hand when users are rewarded such submissions a user may be allowed to submit a limited number of translation corrections during the time period. Such a limit may prevent users who are bilingual or users who have a tendency to submit large numbers of translation corrections from receiving excessive rewards and thereby obtaining an unfair advantage in an underlying game e.g. a multi player online game .

In certain instances feedback on an incorrect translation may be received from only a small number of users e.g. 2 or 3 users which may make it difficult to determine correctness of translation submissions and to automatically generate rewards. For example chats occur in a continuous stream and many users may be more focused on chatting with other users and or playing an underlying game and less focused on submitting translation corrections. Users may also select chats based on what they see in their window and few users may select the same chat. Accordingly when more than one translation correction has been received the proposed corrections may be made available for other users to judge in an effort to gain consensus on the correct translation in exchange for rewards.

Rewards for submitting translation corrections may be given to users according to a raffle system. In such a system rewards are not given for every submission but may be given out randomly with users who submit more corrections being more likely to earn a reward. Such an approach reduces the likelihood that certain players may achieve an unfair advantage over other users due to their ability and or desire to translate messages rather than their ability or effort in the underlying game.

In addition to allowing users to correct bad translations users may also be able to submit feedback regarding wrongly detected languages unfiltered profanities and named entity detection. For example when viewing an original message and a translated message a user may recognize that the automated translation system detected the original language improperly. The user may then inform the system about this language detection mistake in exchange for a possible reward. Likewise a user may be able to inform the system about any profanity that appears in messages thereby allowing the system to filter or delete such profanity from future messages. Users may also be able to inform the system about named entities such as companies brands trademarks etc. that appear in messages. This may allow the systems and methods to recognize when named entities appear in messages and to ensure such entities are named and or identified appropriately.

In general translation corrections submitted by users need careful evaluation to ensure users are rewarded only for accurate corrections. This will improve overall accuracy of the system and prevent users from cheating by submitting fraudulent corrections. In some implementations the accuracy of translation corrections is automatically evaluated using word based features language based features and other features e.g. a word alignment match feature to prevent users from exploiting the system. A part of speech POS based language model may be used to check sentences for grammatical correctness. Additionally some users may submit translation corrections that are grammatically correct but have nothing to do with the original message. For such cases a word alignment match analysis feature may be useful and may be run as periodic process to approve and or reject user submissions. A machine learning approach may be used to validate sparse user feedback in the translation systems and methods described herein.

Table 2 presents examples of suggested translation corrections submitted by users in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. In these examples the original message in the source language is aaa bbb ccc and the correct translation in the target language is xxx yyy zzz. The column labeled Shown Translation includes examples of initial translations proposed by the automated systems described herein.

As shown in Table 2 when a user submits a correct and improved translation the user submission should be approved and the user may receive an appropriate reward. When the user submits a poor quality or fraudulent translation e.g. a random message however the user submission should be denied and no reward should be given to the user. The systems and methods preferably approve or reject such examples as shown in the Status column of this table.

In certain embodiments a translation of an original message is classified according to whether the translation is appropriate for the original message. The classification may treated as a binary classification task in which features are extracted from the translation and the original message. The classification technique may be used to ensure translation corrections submitted by users are accurate. For example in some instances the majority based validation described herein is not suitable due to the small number of responses e.g. one to three that may be received per incorrect translation. The classification technique may also be used to identify and or address hash collisions that appear in cached translation data. For example about 10 or more of the translation entries in a data table may be corrupt due to hash collisions.

Referring to in various implementations the accuracy of translations is evaluated using a translation accuracy module that includes a word based feature module a language based feature module and a word alignment module . The word based feature module is used to assess word based features such as word counts character counts emojis numbers and or punctuation marks. For example when a translation is correct the number of words in the original message and the number of words in the translation are generally about the same. Accordingly if the number of words in the two message differs by more than a threshold amount e.g. a factor of two the translation may be regarded as being incorrect or more likely incorrect. In one example if the number of words in one of the messages e.g. the translation is or fewer than of the number of words in the other message e.g. the original message the word based feature module may conclude that the translation is incorrect or more likely incorrect.

Another word based feature that may be used to assess the accuracy of a translation is the number of characters e.g. letters and numbers in the original message and in the translation. In general when the number of characters the original message is about the same as the number of characters in the translation the translation is more likely to be accurate. A threshold amount may be used to determine when the character counts in the two messages differ excessively. For example if the translation has more than 3 2 as many characters as the original message the word based feature module may conclude that the translation is incorrect or more likely incorrect.

Another word based feature that may be used to assess the accuracy of a translation is the count and order of emojis e.g. ideograms or smileys used in Japanese electronic messages which generally remain unchanged between the original message and the translation. Emojis tend to fall under a certain Unicode text range that could be used to detect them in a given sentence. A regular expression may be used to identify or extract emojis from both of the messages using this Unicode range. For example if the input contains 3 emojis consecutively and the output contains just one emoji it indicates a disparity between input and output. If the count and or order of the emojis is different between the two messages the word based feature module may conclude that the translation is incorrect or more likely incorrect.

An additional word based feature that may be used to assess translation accuracy is the count of any numbers and punctuation marks in the two messages. For example numbers and punctuation marks if any may be identified or extracted in the original message and the translation and the length of the longest common subsequence LCS may be found between them after sorting. This length divided by the maximum of the lengths of the two messages gives a real numbered value for this word based feature. In general the real numbered value provides an indication of a percentage of the numbers and punctuations in the two messages that overlap. Experimental results show that better results are obtained using a real numbered value rather than a binary value for this particular feature. For example an input sentence of I am going to meet you at 4 30 Cya in English could have an equivalent output of Je vais vous recontrer a 4 30 Au revoir . On extracting the punctuation and numbers we get 4 30 for both the English and French versions. The LCS in this case would be 6 by character and the maximum of lengths from among the English and French versions is 36 by character . The resultant real numbered value for this word based feature is 6 36 0.167.

Relying on word based features alone may be insufficient for assessing translation accuracy. For example users may be able to fool at least some of the word based features by submitting a translation correction in which each word of the original message is replaced with a dummy word e.g. xxx to produce a fraudulent correction having the same number of words and characters present in the original message.

To avoid this issue the translation accuracy module may use the language based feature module to evaluate language based features in addition to or instead of the word based features. For example in one embodiment the words present in the original message and in the translation are tagged e.g. using open source POS tagger to identify parts of speech POS e.g. verbs nouns adjectives etc. in the two messages. Each word in the messages may be tagged according to the parts of speech using a different tag set for each language with a different number of tags. For example a sample sentence of The device is easy to use can be tagged by a POS tagger as The DT device NP is VBZ easy JJ to TO use VB showing the part of speech of each word in the sentence. In this case the tags are Determiner DT Noun phrase NP Singular present tense verb VBZ Adjective JJ To TO and Simple verb VB . The tags of primary interest for this purpose are typically verbs followed by adjectives and adverbs.

In certain instances the original message and the translation are tagged separately e.g. using POS tagger and the resulting tags for each message are counted to identify the number of verbs adjectives adverbs etc. in each message. Due to the different types of verbs used in each language e.g. modal verbs infinite verbs past tense verbs future tense verbs etc. a simplified verb tag VB may be obtained using a map for all types of verbs in each language. For example English verb part of speech tags may be mapped to a single verb tag VB as follows VBD Verb past tense VB VBG Verb Gerund VB VBN Verb past participle VB VBP Verb non third person singular present VB and VBZ Verb third person singular present VB. The POS tags in the tagged messages may be replaced with this simplified POS tag set.

After simplifying the POS tags the number of verb tags VB may be counted in both the original message and in the translation. Ideally the number of verbs in each message should be the same but there are some exceptions. For example was sleeping in English translates to dormais in French. The English POS tagger may tag was and sleeping as two different verbs whereas the French POS tagger may tag dormais as a single verb. Verbs such as is was and can are known as auxiliary verbs in English. Other languages may not have an equivalent for these auxiliary verbs and may instead use a single verb as a replacement. To account for such differences in verb use among the languages the systems and methods may use a threshold value e.g. 2 or 3 for difference in the number of verbs between the original message and the translation. For example when the difference between the numbers of verbs in the two messages is greater than two the language based feature module may consider the translation to be incorrect or more likely incorrect. This threshold value of two was found to produce reasonable results through trial and error. Other parts of speech e.g. adjectives and adverbs may be counted and compared between the two messages using one or more additional threshold values.

In some instances however a user may fool this translation accuracy check by simply copying and submitting the existing translation as a correction for the translation. In that case the submission may be classified as a valid correction but the user may not be rewarded for the submission. In some cases a user may also simply change the case of some words in the existing translation to produce and submit a valid correction and the user may deserve a reward and be rewarded for the submission. Accordingly in some embodiments the systems and methods determine whether the existing translation and the user submission are the same or not. If the existing translation and the user submission are the same e.g. including case and capitalization no reward may be given to the user.

In certain embodiments the POS tags check is used to identify instances when an automated translation system failed to correctly identify the language of the original message. For example the language of the original message may have been detected incorrectly when a user s translation correction passes the word count check but fails in the POS tags check. Incorrect language detection is also likely when the number of verbs is equal to zero or all tags are nouns in one message and not in other. For example an original Spanish message may recite Pizt to envi tan pronto regrese una marcha. If the language is detected as being English however the English POS tagger will likely be unable to tag the message and as a default may tag all words as nouns. The English POS tagger s output may be for example tag NP word Pizt stem tag NN word te stem te tag NN word envi u00c3 u00b3 stem tag NN word tan stem tan tag RB word pronto stem pronto tag JJ word regrese stem tag NN word una stem tag NN word marcha stem . By comparison the Spanish tagger s output for the same original message may be tag NP word Pizt stem tag PPX word te stem t u00fa tag VLfin word envi u00c3 u00b3 stem tag ADV word tan stem tan tag ADV word pronto stem pronto tag VLfin word regrese stem regresar tag ART word una stem un tag NC word marcha stem marcha . The tags NN RB and PPX refer to Noun singular or mass Adverb and Possessive pronoun respectively.

Accordingly in certain instances the parts of speech of the original message and a translation are compared to determine whether the language was properly identified in the original message. In general a language detection failure is more likely to have occurred when one of the messages e.g. the translation is tagged has having a non zero number of verbs and the other message e.g. the original message is tagged has having no verbs. Language detection failure is also more likely when all words in one message are tagged as nouns while the other message has several types of POS tags e.g. nouns verbs and adjectives .

In various embodiments translation accuracy is assessed by identifying and reviewing the proper nouns in the original message and in the translation. In general when a translation is accurate the proper nouns e.g. names of people and cities are the same in translation and in the original message. Comparing the two messages and filtering common words that were left untranslated may therefore be useful as a feature for identifying genuine translations. In some instances the presence of such untranslated proper nouns may help improve translation precision but the absence of any untranslated proper nouns may not give any information about translation precision. If proper nouns are identified in the original message but not in the translation the accuracy of the translation may be considered to be incorrect or more likely incorrect. A penalty may be added to a real valued score returned for this proper noun feature which helps identify any bad translations and improve translation accuracy. For example when the proper nouns are inconsistent between the two messages an accuracy score for the translation may be reduced by the penalty.

Alternatively or additionally translation accuracy may be evaluated by analyzing and comparing the grammar in the original message and the translation. Working with multiple languages may make it difficult to parse trees for all languages to understand the grammar of the sentence. The messages are also often written in chat language which follows a different grammar compared to plain or formal speech in the native language.

Accordingly to recognize a pattern among the grammar of the chat language the sentence may be tagged with POS tags to build an N gram language model on the POS tags thereby providing an approximation of the underlying grammatical structure. An n gram may be defined as a collection of n consecutive words. A model of these n grams may be typical for a given language and or may be used to represent n consecutive words in the given language. In certain implementations the method of word based n grams is extended to a Part of Speech based n grams. In other words a shallow method of parsing sentences may be used where words in a sentence are tagged with a POS tagger. In one approach a BLEU score is computed on POS tags rather than on actual text.

A trigram 3 gram language model may be created on the POS tagged sentences for each language. For example the sentence The device is easy to use has a POS tagged output of The DT device NP is VBZ easy JJ to TO use VB. Word based trigrams in this sentence would be The device is device is easy is easy to easy to use. The corresponding POS based trigrams would be DT NP VBZ NP VBZ JJ VBZ JJ TO JJ TO VB.

Trigrams with higher probabilities may be used to infer partial structures of the grammar. For example a trigram language model built on POS tags may have a probability associated with each trigram. The probability may be computed as the ratio of the number of times a given trigram has occurred in a text corpus compared to all the trigrams in the same text. A grammatical trigram tends to be repeated often and hence will have a higher probability also known as a language model score . Hence when a message receives a higher score on this language model the message is more likely to be grammatically correct. This score may be useful to detect instances when a user types a spam message to get rewards. The score may also be useful to determine when the language detection has failed. For example since separate models may be used for each language the score of a sentence in the wrong language may be much lower. The score may also be useful for detecting when the quality of a translation is good. Separate models may be trained for human and machine translations for this purpose.

In certain embodiments the language model is trained using translations that have been verified as being accurate. A trigram model may be built on the POS tags.

An inherent problem with n grams of any size is a lack of all possible hypotheses. In such cases a backoff method is followed where n 1 grams and n 2 grams are identified. For example if an unknown POS trigram is seen such as DT NP JJ the model may retroactively check to see if the bigrams DT NP and NP JJ have a language model score indicating grammaticality. If the bigrams do not have probabilities or if the probabilities are too low another backoff may be done to check unigram language model scores for DT NP JJ. All three models can also be grouped by linear interpolation with more weights on trigram models fewer weights on bigram models and even fewer weights on unigram models.

The most frequently occurring trigrams of POS tags for chat English are as follows 1.0 1.0 1.0 and 1.0. A score of 1.0 indicates a 100 probability that a given trigram sequence is grammatical at all times it occurs. In general chat language uses more pronouns beginning with Wh followed by a verb which is captured by . People also tend to end chat language sentences with adverbs or adjectives as in You are cool or This is awesome which is captured by where S1 and S2 are end of sentence tags. These trigrams may therefore be used to recognize at least some structure of the underlying grammar in each language. With the language model built for all languages of interest the models may be saved in JSON format and may be loaded instantly at any time.

In some implementations after a message has been POS tagged the systems and methods may count the number of trigrams in the message that match with an existing trigram language model. Each trigram in the model may have a probability score associated with it and for each trigram in the message the corresponding score of the trigram is identified in the model. In some instances if the score is higher than a threshold value e.g. 0.05 the trigram is counted as a match. Otherwise the trigram is not counted as a match. The systems and methods may compute the number of matches of trigrams to a total number of trigrams in the sentence and this ratio may be used as real valued feature for assessing translation accuracy. For example a trigram of easy to use which may occur frequently in grammatical text can have a high probability score language model score of around 0.68. By contrast an ungrammatical trigram of easy use to could have a smaller probability of occurrence of around 0.04. When compared with a defined threshold of 0.05 the ungrammatical trigrams may be filtered out and the number of trigrams above the threshold may provide a quantitative value for the grammaticality of the text.

After obtaining a POS tagged message the probability of the sentence may be computed using the trigram language model. In one embodiment the log probability of each trigram in the sentence is determined and the sum of the log probabilities is computed. This sum is then divided by the number of words in the sentence to obtain a score for the sentence. The score may be used as a real valued feature for assessing translation accuracy. The log probability of a trigram is preferably calculated as a linear interpolation of trigram bigram and unigram probabilities. For example in the sentence The device is easy to use the POS tagged output is The DT device NP is VBZ easy JJ to TO use VB. The POS based trigrams for the sentence are DT NP VBZ NP VBZ JJ VBZ JJ TO and JJ TO VB. Each of these trigrams has a probability of occurrence in a given language corpus. Assuming these probabilities are 0.12 0.44 0.32 and 0.89 for the respective trigrams a combined score for grammaticality of the sentence may be computed as a log probability. In this case the log probability is computed as log 0.12 log 0.44 log 0.32 log 0.89 which is equal to 1.82. On a relative scale the log probability provides a numerical indication of the grammaticality of the sentence.

In addition to or instead of the word based and language based features described above the translation accuracy module may use the word alignment module to assess an alignment of words between the original message and the translation. To generate a listing of potential word alignment pairs a translation accuracy checking algorithm was run with word based features alone on a database and parallel corpus was extracted with translation pairs having probability values 0.90. This indicates that only good quality translation message pairs were filtered to create the parallel corpus. 100 K sentences were collected for English and French pairs and English and Spanish pairs. The parallel corpus for these 100 K sentences was fed to a statistical machine translation toolkit i.e. GIZA to extract word alignments. The toolkit extracted approximately 25 30 K word alignment pairs and the associated probability scores for these pairs.

Given that there are usually multiple word alignments per word it may be beneficial to select only alignments that have a probability score greater than a certain threshold e.g. 0.01 . Even with the threshold however more than one alignment may be obtained per word most of which are typically due to spelling errors or the same word in a different tense e.g. past tense or future tense . Sample word alignments between English and French are shown in Table 3. Separate word alignments may be obtained for both possible orders of two languages e.g. English to French and French to English . Two word alignment files may therefore be extracted per language pair. The word alignments for the source language i.e. the language of the original message to the target language i.e. the language of the translation may be referred to as source alignments while the word alignments for the target language to the source language may be referred to as target alignments.

The source alignments and the target alignments may be loaded into two separate files. For each word in the original message that is also present in the source alignments the systems and methods determine if at least one corresponding word is present in the translation and also in the target alignments. The same process is then applied to the translation sentence. Finally the percentage of words that were found in the word alignments file is returned as a feature for assessing translation accuracy.

In certain implementations word alignments are extracted for language pairs that include English as one of the languages. For example the language pairs may be English coupled with one of Spanish French Polish Portuguese Dutch German Danish Swedish Turkish Italian and Russian for a total of 11 language pairs and 11 2 22 word alignment files. For language pairs that do not include English e.g. translating French to Russian English may be used as an intermediate language to extract alignments. For example when validating a translation from French to Russian French to English may be used to extract word alignments from the original message and Russian to English may be used to extract word alignments from the translation. The intersection of these two sets gives a percentage of match among the word alignments in both messages. This method may be extended to all pairs of languages.

In various embodiments user confidence is calculated to provide an indication of whether a user s translation submissions may be trusted. Apart from other approaches discussed herein a user may be trusted more or less based on the user s history of translation corrections. The number of translations corrected and the number of translations rewarded may be stored in a data table for various users. This allows a percentage of corrections done by the player to be calculated and translation corrections may be approved at least in part based on the particular user s confidence threshold. This can easily separate out spammers from genuine players who correct translations.

The word based and language based features described above e.g. four word based features and four language based features may be fit using a linear regression model. After training the model preferably returns a real valued number for each translation pair and a threshold value may be used to classify each translation pair as either good or bad. For example if the features return numeric values of x1 x2 x3 . . . x8 a regression equation may be y a1 x1 a2 x2 . . . a8 x8 where a1 a2 a8 are coefficients obtained from modeling a linear regression equation and y is an output value. A preferred value for the threshold value y was found to be 0.65 after experiments with precision and recall using an ROC curve.

After adding the word alignment based feature described above and re running linear regression on the word based and language based features the preferred threshold was changed to 0.76. Adding the word alignment based feature also increased the AUC value from 0.853 to 0.976.

Table 4 shows coefficients of regression obtained from training 13 k sentences for each of the word based feature language based features and word alignment feature. The results in the table indicate that the emojis feature and the character counts have small coefficients of regression after normalization which means these features were found to contribute little to the assessment of translation of accuracy.

The regression model was evaluated by 10 fold cross validation on 13 k sentences of French to English and Spanish to English pairs. The gold standard labels for the data were computed using BING translation with some human supervision. Table 5 presents the precision recall accuracy and F measure values in percentages for the evaluation. Precision represents a ratio of true positive translation pairs out of all translation pairs marked as true by our method. Recall is a ratio of the true positive translation pairs out of all translation pairs known to be true pairs. Accuracy is a ratio of a sum of outcomes marked as true positives and true negatives to the total test set size. F measure is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. These metrics may be used in classification tasks to measure system performance and reliability. 13 k sentences were used as a training set and 400 hand annotated sentences were used for the test. Since the test set was small the numbers for test were lower than the numbers for the 13 k sentences.

Table 6 shows the results of a 10 fold cross validation on a 13 k sentence data set where W refers to the use of word based features. L refers to the use of language based features and A refers to the use of the word alignment feature. The results show that word based features help to improve precision and the word alignment feature helps to improve recall significantly. Language based features give a little boost to both precision and recall. In general recall indicates how accurately bad decisions are detected from a total dataset. The results in the table show that adding word alignment based features improves recall. Precision indicates how accurately good translations were predicted out of the total translations marked as correct by the system. The results in the table show that adding word based features improves precision.

Table 7 shows the results of fitting the various word based language based and word alignment features with other machine algorithms in accordance with certain embodiments. Results until now have been illustrated using linear regression techniques for binding the different features together. Machine Learning algorithms exist that can be used to bind together variables features in this context to produce an ensemble outcome that is better than the individual parts. Linear regression presents a uni dimensional method for combining variables. Two dimensional and multi dimensional methods for combining variables exist in Machine Learning algorithm literature. These algorithms were employed to find a more optimal way of combining the features used in the task of predicting good translation pairs.

The results in Table 7 were obtained by combining the features with various Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset used included 13 k sentences and the parameters were tuned using a gridSearch algorithm. From the methods listed in the table the gradient boosting classifier and the random forests methods are ensemble based methods which explains why these methods gave better results. Gradient Boosting Machines GBM and Random Forests give very good results though GBM took a longer time for training. Since the model needs to be trained only once however training time is largely irrelevant.

The final translation accuracy checking algorithm was tested on a held out test set of 3045 English French sentence pairs. The results are shown in Table 8. WLAplain features perform poorly due to the fact that word alignments were extracted from plain speak databases. Since the messages are modified after a series of transformations a sharp drop in the results can be found. Word alignment were extracted from chat speak databases and some smoothing was done for smaller sentences to avoid a zero score in features. WLA shows the result for the chatspeak databases. Bad precision with WLA features indicate many correct translations were denied. The features were fit with linear regression as Random Forest was overfitting the results. In general these results may be used as a basis for selecting a final set of features to be used for an algorithm. A higher accuracy is generally preferred whereas a higher precision rewards more true translation pairs entered by users and a high recall ensures fewer wrong entries being misclassified as correct. The WLA feature set is desirable according to the results in the table. A threshold of 0.75 may be selected for a higher recall e.g. to obtain the fewest possible malicious entries being marked as correct and a threshold of 0.68 may be selected in cases when higher precision is desired.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
