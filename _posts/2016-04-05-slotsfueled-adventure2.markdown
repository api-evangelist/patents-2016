The present embodiments relate to methods for executing a game and more particularly methods systems and computer programs for executing casino games online.

The popularity of casino games has extended to casino games played online. Online games such as poker slots blackjack etc. are played by a large number of users on a computer. However most of the slot games in the market are very similar to the real life slot games that have been around for a long time and the online slot games merely seem to copy the user interface provided by the real slot machines without adding much to the online experience. Because of this differentiation between game providers is very small.

Additionally social interaction in online games is appealing to many users that wish to share some of their gaming experience with other friends or other potential friends that may be made online. But existing slots online games do not currently provide many opportunities for social interaction with other players nor they provide gaming interactions with other players as the game of one slots player does not relate to the game of another slots players.

Methods devices systems and computer programs are presented for executing a game. It should be appreciated that the present embodiments can be implemented in numerous ways such as a method an apparatus a system a device or a computer program on a computer readable medium. Several embodiments are described below.

In some embodiments methods systems and computer programs are provided for executing games processed by one or mover servers. The one or more servers are provided with access to a network for communication with one or more client computers. One method includes operations for sending an interface for a casino type game to a client computer and for starting an online game that is displayed with the interface for the casino type game. The method further includes operations for detecting a bet placed in the casino type game and for determining an outcome of the bet in the casino type game. A character is moved along a path of the online game where the amount of movement of the character is based on the outcome of the bet.

In one embodiment a processor implemented method for executing a game is provided. The method includes operations for detecting a bet placed on a slots game and for calculating a win amount based on the bet and based on mechanics for calculating prizes on the slots game. Additionally an avatar is advanced along a path of an adventure game associated with the slots game where the advancement is based on the win amount.

In another embodiment a server for executing a game includes a processor and a non transitory memory in communication with the processor. The non transitory memory includes program instructions for a game manager module and program instructions for a spin manager module. The game manager is operable to detect a bet placed on a slots game by a first player in a remote client device in communication with the server and the spin manager is operable to calculate a win amount based on the bet and based on mechanics for calculating prizes on the slots game. In addition the game manager is operable to advance an avatar along a path of an adventure game associated with the slots game the advancement of the avatar being based on the win amount and the game manager is operable to transmit to the remote client results of the win amount and the amount of advancement of the avatar.

In yet another embodiment a computer program embedded in a non transitory computer readable storage medium when executed by one or more processors for executing a game includes program instructions for detecting a bet placed on a slots game and program instructions for calculating a win amount based on the bet and based on mechanics for calculating prizes on the slots game. The computer program further includes program instructions for advancing a first avatar along a path of an adventure game associated with the slots game where the advancement is based on the win amount. The first avatar is selectable by a player from a plurality of avatars.

Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The following embodiments describe a method and apparatus for executing a game. It will be apparent that the present embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present embodiments.

It is also noted that the embodiments described herein are described with reference to the slots online game but the principles may be utilized in other gambling online games as well as in gambling real life games. The embodiments described herein should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

The game interface display includes a slots playing area an adventure area and overhead selection buttons . The GUI includes a lobby where the player may select one of several rooms for playing slots games. The rooms have different themes such as underwater world desert city tropical paradise battle zone animal reserve etc. There could be several instances of a theme so there may be several rooms with the same theme. Once the player selects a room the player is presented GUI to play slots such as the one shown in .

There are players people going in and out of the slots rooms. There is a lobby and the player may select from different rooms. For example there is an underwater room a desert room a jungle room etc. There could be several instances of a room with for example 100 people or more.

The slots playing area includes slot wheels a chat area and buttons and counters related to the betting in the slots game. The wheels spin when the player presses e.g. clicks on the spin button . The player is able to enter the amount of lines to bet on each wheel spin. Each line includes a different combination of locations within each wheel. For example one line may include the five locations across the center line while other lines may form different combinations of locations such as the top location on the first three wheels followed by the center location on the fourth wheel and followed by the bottom location on the fifth wheel.

In bet field the player enters the amount being bet for each line and the total bet field indicates the total amount bet in the current spin. Counter indicates the amount of currency owned by the player for placing bets in the slots game. The total bet amount is equal to the number of lines times the bet per line . A maximum lines button provides a shortcut to the player for betting the maximum number of lines. When the player gets a winning combination of the wheels the total win field indicates the amount won. The chat area allows players in the same room to exchange messages with each other or with the whole community in the room.

In the adventure area an adventure game takes place where a pet also referred to as an avatar or a mount advances along a road to get points overcome obstacles play mini games etc. The adventure game is inter linked with the slots game. To move the pet the player spins the slots machine situated below the adventure game to win prizes causing the pet to advance. In one embodiment the amount of progress made by the pet is proportional to the amount of winnings where if there are no winnings in a spin of the wheel then there is no advancement and if there is a win after spinning the wheel the advancements is proportional to the amount won. In another embodiment pet always makes some progress after spinning the wheel and the progress is proportional to the amount won where a little progress is made if there is no win in the slots and if there is a win in the slots then the progress is proportional to the win and is bigger than the progress made when no amount is won.

In one embodiment even when the player loses the player obtains meta cash which can be used to buy virtual items but not to play the slots machine. In one embodiment the meta cash randomly appears on the road and as the pet collects the gems the meta cash is added to the meta cash counter . In addition the pet may find other rewards as the pet advances along the road such as special keys special gems energy etc.

Adventure progress bar is a graphical indicator of the progress made along the road. In one embodiment the road is considered infinite because the road does not have a defined end. As the pet moves along the road adventure progress bar fills up and when the adventure progress bar is completely filled up some rewards are given to the player and the adventure progress bar is reset for example to start a new level.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different layouts adventure games game themes betting mechanisms etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In one embodiment the gambling game is selected from a group consisting of a slots game a poker game a blackjack game a bet on a sports event other casino games etc. For description purposes embodiments presented here utilize a slots game but the principles may be utilized for any other type of gambling game.

In one embodiment the adventure type game includes an avatar that travels along the road and the progress of the avatar along the road as well as some of the rewards obtained by the avatar depend on the outcomes in the gambling game. In other embodiments the outcome in the gambling game may result in a plurality of operations in the adventure game such as advancing on the road traveling in different directions in a game map unlocking new game areas obtaining rewards obtaining new assets obtaining additional game currency for the adventure game etc.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different games different inter relations between the games etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

From operation the method flows to operation where the game waits for a bet to be placed by the player in the gambling game. Once the bet is received the method continues to operation where the game determines the outcome of the bet in the gambling game e.g. whether there is a winning combination after spinning the slots wheels . The outcome of the bet includes a win amount which may be zero or greater than zero. In one embodiment the outcome of the bet is based on rules created by the game designers as described in more detail below with reference to .

In operation the measure of progress in the adventure type game is calculated where the measure of progress is based on the win amount in the gambling game. From operation the method flows to operation where a check is made to determine if an end of the presentation of the GUI has taken place. If the player has selected to end the GUI the method terminates and if and end has not been requested the method flows back to operation to wait for the next bet in the gambling game.

In another embodiment only friends of the player that are in the same vicinity of the player s pet are shown on the road. For example a friend of the player is shown on the road including the name e.g. Jill the friend s pet e.g. frog pet and icon which may be a picture of the player.

In addition the players playing slots in the same room also referred to as playing in the same slots machine are also playing as a team to make progress in the adventure game. The team collaboration is referred to as a progressive collaboration game. In one embodiment when a player in the room gets a big win in the slots the winner appears on the screen of other players in the room and shares some of the winnings. In one embodiment the sharing is done by dropping gems in the roads of other players so their pets can pick up the gems in the road.

Community progress bar shows the progress made by the players as a team in the current slots machine. As the players make progress in the game the community progress bar gets filled to indicate how far the players have advanced as a group. Milestones in community progress bar define special locations that when reached by the group cause the game to reward the players provide a game challenge or some other game operation. In one embodiment when group reaches milestone a special game operation takes place such as giving the players more energy or prices increasing the experience level providing a mini game battling against a common enemy etc. In the one embodiment when community progress bar gets completely full a challenge is presented to the room as a whole for example by fighting a dragon together. After the challenge is completed the community progress bar is reset back to the beginning.

The community approach to fill the community progress bar provides a collaborative experience to the players in the room because the players fill the community progress bar by working together.

In addition some pets travel better in land e.g. horse four wheel vehicle while other pets travel better in water e.g. gold fish submarine and some pets may travel over land and water e.g. frog etc. Further yet pets may have different collection rates where the collection rates refers to the ability to collect items found on the road e.g. gems gold coins keys etc. . For example slow pets may have higher collection rates than faster pets because slower pets travel slower.

Additionally pets may have different fighting skills were some pets are stronger and have better fighting capabilities e.g. shark eagle tank and other pets are weaker e.g. lamb frog . Further yet some pets may be able to jump over obstacles e.g. all terrain vehicle while other pets may take longer to overcome obstacles e.g. elephant .

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different types of pets skills adventure games gambling games etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In one embodiment the game GUI includes several options for managing player assets such as collections mounts mount parts and party perks . Pets are also referred to herein as mounts. The exemplary embodiment of shows a graphical interface for selecting the mount .

In one embodiment the player is able to select which mount to use for the road adventure. As the player advances in the game the player gains expertise and new mounts are made available to the player. In the exemplary embodiment of three mounts are available to the player sheep frog and shark while three other mounts submarine car and tank are not yet available but are presented to the user to encourage the user to get the necessary assets to unlock these pets.

In one embodiment the pets that are available include an icon such as a picture of a sheep for the sheep pet and the pets that are not available are represented by a special symbol to indicate that the pets are not available also referred to as being locked.

For each pet or mount a brief description is provided to indicate the skills and characteristics of the mount. In one embodiment if the player clicks on the mount a different page is presented to provide further details about the characteristics of the mount. If the mount is not yet available a description of the price for getting the mount is provided.

In the exemplary embodiment of a page for building mounts is presented. When the player selects the option mount parts several different mounts are presented to the player such as mounts and . Some of the mounts may not be available to the player yet such as mount because the player has not yet reached a certain level or milestone in the game. The unavailable mounts are presented as grayed out dimmed or with some other recognizable characteristic to indicate that the mount is not yet available. Other mounts such as shark include an icon that is not grayed out to show that the mount is available for completion by the player.

Completion includes collecting all the parts associated with the mount. In one embodiment the parts to build a shark pet include fins teeth tail body and nose but other embodiments may utilize different parts. In one embodiment each part may be bought by the player utilizing game currency such as meta cash although other types of currency or assets are also possible. In addition the player may request other players to help and when other players help the requester gets the required part. In one embodiment a request includes sending a petition in the social network or in another website such as the website of the game provider. In another embodiment not shown a submarine is built by the player as a mount. To build the submarine the player needs to collect 15 pieces of metal five pieces of glass 20 bolts and 3 units of power. The mounts that are made by putting together parts are also referred to as buildables or collectibles.

Once the player collect all the parts clicking in the option Build a Mount creates or builds the mount. In one embodiment the mount may have different levels of performance . The first time the mount is built the mount is a basic mount with basic features. In higher levels the mount improves its appearance or performance in the adventure game. In order to get higher levels of the mount additional parts must be gathered. Therefore if the player has already obtained the mount for level 2 the parts area will list the parts necessary to get to level 3 for the same mount.

By providing multiple levels for the mount the player is given challenges to improve the mount. The top level mount will be better looking and have better abilities to advance in the game than lower level mounts. As players obtain more sophisticated mounts other players that see the sophisticated mounts in the game will be encouraged to also get sophisticated mounts.

In one embodiment game manager manages the game operations for each of the players and game manager interacts with other modules to perform respective game operations within the game. In addition the game manager manages the game data stored for running the player s games although other modules may also access and change some of the game data. In one embodiment the functionality implemented by game manager includes presenting the game board to the player e.g. including the gambling game and the adventure game presenting options to the player for customizing and controlling an avatar of the game providing an interface between the player and other game modules synchronizing game operations with client managing communications with client etc.

Spin manager manages the gambling operations in the game. In one embodiment spin manager controls the amount that may be wagered by the player in the gambling game e.g. number of lines amount bet per line etc. . In one embodiment spin manager receives a betting instruction from client and performs a game simulation regarding the chance game being played. For example the spin manager spins the wheels and determines the outcome of the spinning including a possible win amount. The calculation of prizes is also referred to as game mechanics for calculating prizes in the slots game. The calculation is based on game rules and a degree of randomness related to the game of chance.

The probability of winning is driven by data set up by game designers. The design data specifies the symbols on the wheels the combinations that result in payouts the odds etc. More details on the design data are given below with reference to .

After calculating the result of the spin spin manager sends the result back to the client game . In another embodiment the spinning of the wheels is performed in the client device and the client device synchronizes with spin manager to share the results of the betting operations in the gambling game.

Room manager manages the gambling room the place where a plurality of players play the gambling game while also cooperating on same game objectives. In a way each player has its own personal game with its own personal objectives but all the players also share one common game that is interrelated with the individual games.

In one embodiment the common game relates to a community progress bar and involves some periods of cooperation such as when all the players in the room work together to beat a Dragon that appears in the adventure game. In one embodiment there is collaboration in the game and as every player spins and gets points the bar gets filled for the whole room. All player devices such has player device in the same room provide updates to the server so the server may calculate the progress of the room in the progress bar. Therefore the clients send updates to the server and the server periodically sends out the current state of the community progress bar e.g. every five seconds although other periods are also possible . In one embodiment the frequency of updates is completed by the game designers and is kept in the design data .

In addition room manager periodically checks the position of each of the players in the room within the road of the adventure game. In one embodiment when two friends are in the same area in the road room manager sends updates to each player so the GUI of each player displays the name or some other symbol associated with the friend. In one embodiment to increase the awareness of other players being in the room room manager will also send instructions to display the pets from some players that are not friends in order to see more traffic in the game road. If the game road has a large number of players not all players are displayed on the road because it would lead to congestion in the screen.

Social manager manages the social interactions of the players which include determining the social links established within the game and outside the game among the players. For example the social manager may suggest friends in the social network to the player that may become friends within the game.

Game data represents one or more databases that hold game related data. In one embodiment game data includes player data room data design data and social data . Social data includes the relationships established by players in the game within the game and the relationships existing among the players in one or more social websites. More details on design data player data and room data are given below with reference to .

Design manager provides an interface to the game designers in order to configure the different parameters for operating the game. In addition the design manager manages the design data which is utilized by the different game modules to determine the outcome of certain game operations in the game such as winning a bet collecting gems on the road or determining which mounts are available at which levels.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different game modules different data modules or combine the functionality of one or more modules into a single module. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

Some of the data structures include sub fields. For example to calculate the odds of winning in the gambling game the game designer may set parameters regarding an average winning frequency the odds for winning a jackpot the odds for winning a large price the odds for winning a medium price the odds for winning a small price etc. The odds of winning also include rules not shown for determining what constitutes a large a medium or a small price.

In one embodiment when someone in the room gets a big jackpot some of the other players share the good fortune. The server detects when a player gets a big jackpot and proceeds to place the shared rewards e.g. gems on the road or give the rewards to players in some other fashion. In one embodiment the rewards given to players are different for friends and for non friends. In one embodiment friends get more rewards than non friends.

The rules for sharing include several rules and parameters associated with the rules such as the size of the minimum jackpot won by a player in order to share the good fortune with other players what are the amounts that are shared with other players when to share with friends or with non friends in the game etc.

The data regarding collectibles in one embodiment includes specifying when the collectables are available to the player e.g. expertise required to unlock the collectable the requirements for getting each of the parts the cost for each of the parts the levels at which the parts may be available or usable etc.

The awards field includes data regarding the placement of awards on the road in the adventure game the awards and symbols on the wheels the appearance and behavior of mini games etc.

In one embodiment player data includes data about assets owned by the player and about game statistics or behavior. In one embodiment the asset data includes the amount of currency owned by the player the amount of energy the collections completed or in progress the pets or mounts available to the player parts acquired and present in inventory etc. Additionally the statistical data may include the amounts bet during game play the amount of time spent playing the frequency of gameplay etc.

Room data includes data regarding the players in the room the progress of the community bar prices to be given to the room players when milestones are met or after some other game event the status of a boss that the players in the room are fighting against the requirements to enter the room the statistics regarding room play friendship relationships in the room etc.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different data structures or organize the data in different fashion have more or less fields combine data structures etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

From operation the method flows to operation where an avatar is advanced along a path within an adventure game. The adventure game is associated or interlinked with the slots game and the advancement in the adventure game is based on the amount won if any in the slots game. In one embodiment the avatar obtains a predetermined amount of progress in the adventure game even if the player does not win anything after spinning the wheels of the slots game.

In another embodiment a player gets meta cash in the adventure game as a pet advances in the adventure game. The meta cash may be utilized to acquire game assets such as parts for building collectibles which are mounts that are built by putting together a plurality of parts.

When a player provides an input into the player s client device the client device may in response send a message via the communications network to the social networking server. The social networking server may update the player profile save the message to a database send messages to other players etc. The social gaming network may include a social graph database which stores player relationships social player profiles player messages and player social data.

The gaming servers host one or more gaming applications and perform the computations necessary to provide the gaming features to the players and clients. One or more gaming databases store data related to the gaming services such as the gaming applications and modules virtual gaming environment data player gaming session data player scores player virtual gaming profiles game stage levels etc. The gaming servers may utilize the data from the gaming databases to perform the computations related to providing gaming services for the players.

Room Servers manage the slot rooms system in the game including the creation tracking expiration abandonment and deletion of rooms. In addition a room database holds room information and design db holds information data such as the data associated with the data structures of .

Each game server has access to one or more game databases for keeping game data. In addition a single database can store game data for one or more online games. Each game server may also include one or more levels of caching. Game data cache is a game data cache for the game data stored in game databases . For increased performance caching may be performed in several levels of caching. For instance data more frequently used is stored in a high priority cache while data requiring less access during a session will be cached and updated less frequently.

The number of game servers changes over time as the gaming platform is an extensible platform that changes the number of game servers according to the load on the gaming infrastructure. As a result the number of game servers will be higher during peak playing times and the number of game servers will be lower during off peak hours. In one embodiment the increase or decrease of bandwidth is executed automatically based on current line usage or based on historical data.

One or more social network management servers provide support for the social features incorporated into the online games. The social network management servers access social data from one or more social networks via Application Programming Interfaces API made available by the social network providers. An example of a social network is Facebook but it is possible to have other embodiments implemented in other social networks. Each social network includes social data and this social data or a fraction of the social data is made available via API . As in the case of the game servers the number of social network management servers that are active at a point in time changes according to the load on the infrastructure. As the demand for social data increases the number of social network management servers increases. Social network management servers cache user data in database and social data in database . The social data may include the social networks where a player is present the social relationships for the player the frequency of interaction of the player with the social network and with other players etc. Additionally the user data kept in database may include the player s name demographics e mail games played frequency of access to the game infrastructure etc.

It is noted that the embodiment illustrated in is an exemplary online gaming infrastructure. Other embodiments may utilize different types of servers databases APIs etc. and the functionality of several servers can be provided by a single server or the functionality can be spread across a plurality of distributed servers.
