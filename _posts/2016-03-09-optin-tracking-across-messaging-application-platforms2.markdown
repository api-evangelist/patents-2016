Telecommunications service providers support short code messaging services short codes are associated with premium services that are not included in standard service packages offered by the telecommunications service providers and subscribed to by the owners of user equipment. Short codes may be strings of numbers and or characters these strings are shorter than standard 10 digit telephone numbers and may be unique to a telecommunications service provider or may be shared by multiple telecommunications service providers. The length of short codes may differ among and between countries. In the United States short codes shared by multiple providers may be five characters long or greater and short codes that are carrier specific may be 4 digits while short codes for emergency services may be 3 digits. Charges incurred due to these premium services may be reflected in a subscriber s bill or other balance of voice and data services that may be tracked and maintained by the telecommunications service provider.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Various types of user equipment UE may be configured to use short messaging services SMS and multimedia messaging services MMS . Increasingly in addition to those forms of messaging users have the option to download and or subscribe to internet protocol IP messaging services in the form of applications provided by a telecommunications service provider which may be referred to as native IP messaging applications or more simply as native messaging applications and in the form of applications provided by third party vendors e.g. not by the telecommunications service provider which may be referred to as third party IP messaging applications or vendor messaging applications. IP messaging either native or vendor messaging may be preferred by some users and application developers due to the increased functionality as compared to some SMS and MMS systems. The term IP messaging may be employed herein to discuss messaging services including applications developed and or supported by the telecommunications service provider or by parties other than a telecommunications service provide and which support data messaging. These IP messaging services rely on message transmissions that are sent using TCP IP data links. SMS and MMS messaging programs may employ short codes which are shorter than standard 10 digit telephone numbers and may be unique to a telecommunications service provider or may be shared by multiple telecommunications service providers.

The use of short codes is tracked by telecommunications service providers in the United States in order to demonstrate compliance to the rules and regulations associated with opting in consenting to additional charges and telecommunications service providers may be audited by government bodies or third parties to show compliance to the tracking and storing of consent to additional charges or plan usage. The short codes may each be associated with programs of purchase information and this association or link may be stored in a database. Each program or type of purchase information is displayed to a user in order to obtain consent to additional charges or plan usage. The purchase information may differ between different telecommunications service providers different premium services providers purchase types purchase amounts purchase occurrence single or recurring or other aspects of premium services that may impact a plurality of information that the telecommunications service provider displays to a user aside from a one time or recurring cost of purchase. For example a short code associated with the purchase of a VIP pass to a sporting event for 100 may be associated with a first plurality of information that may be referred to as purchase information and a short code associated with the purchase of a 1 song or gaming add on may be associated with a second plurality of information that is different than the first plurality of information. As a part of demonstrating compliance to this law telecommunications service providers track and store the users consent opt in to premium services that result in charges and or plan usage. A premium service may be a service or good or a combination of services and goods that is not included in a service plan and or that which would incur data or other plan usage beyond what is considered normal use and therefore requires under government regulations an opt in.

Various opt in methods may be used that allow a user to opt in from a handset or from another device and opt ins may be for a single purchase a series of purchases or all purchases from a particular application or a particular device. The tracking and storing of opt ins may be used in addition to showing compliance to government regulations to prevent fraudulent purchases and to notify users when a purchase attempt is made on a device or in a particular messaging application for example if a user account is tied to multiple devices in a corporate or family plan. As such telecommunications service providers add value to a user s experience in addition to establishing compliance to government regulations by validating the user s intention to purchase a premium service using a secondary consent and by identifying the customer and UE correctly.

Currently IP messaging applications stored on various types of user equipment may not comprise the functionality to use or access short codes and or may be unable to communicate with the telecommunications service provider even if a short code is associated with access to premium services. This may not typically be a problem for native messaging applications because the telecommunications service provider controls the development of these native messaging applications and can assure that the functionality to use or access short codes be built into those native messaging applications either by its own engineering staff or by contracted vendors working to the requirements specifications provided by the telecommunication service provider. When third party messaging applications not coordinated by the telecommunication service provider are installed on the UE however such functionality may not be included. The focus of the following disclosure is directed to this kind of third party messaging applications although the teachings may equally be applied to native applications. The systems and methods discussed herein bridge the IP messaging application and SMS MMS platforms to enable the use of short codes in vendor messaging applications and the ability of telecommunications service providers to track and store information related to these codes as required by federal regulations. Using the systems and methods discussed herein users may purchase or decline to purchase premium services offered through IP messaging applications. The telecommunications service provider can track and store these transactions including opt ins in a manner compliant with government regulation. In various embodiments telecommunications service carriers expand carrier billing payment methods to use with IP messaging in contrast to SMS and MMS native messaging clients provided by the provider on the UE and to track billing opt ins in order to comply with government regulations.

In some embodiments short codes may be shared by telecommunications service provider and in other embodiments short codes may be unique to individual telecommunications service providers. Short codes are employed for access to premium services which may also be referred to as value added services because the premium services may not be included in packages offered by the telecommunications service provider. These packages which may be referred to as bundles or service plans are contractual agreements between users and the telecommunications service provider and may be pre pay post pay or pay as you go agreements any of which does not include the use of premium services. The service plans may comprise various combinations allotments amounts included in a monthly or other period charge these allotments may be associated with voice and data services associated with a user account. In some embodiments a service plan may be specific to a single device piece of user equipment associated with a user account and in alternate embodiments it may be associated with multiple pieces of user equipment associated with a user account. For voice and data services beyond these allotments for a given time period or for the use of premium services or offers not included in the service plan the user may be able to pay a fee for access. Therefore use of the premium services may result in additional charges on a bill or use of voice or data allotments associated with various service plans and telecommunications service providers are required by law to track these opt ins to charges.

An opt in to charges may comprise consent to accept additional charges on a future bill consent to immediate payment charge for services and or consent to an amount of service plan allotment usage. Each telecommunications service provider has a plurality of purchase information associated with one or more short codes that may be displayed to users who are making purchases of premium services. This purchase information may provide information about the service s being purchased an opt in for reminders associated with purchase the price plan usage involved in purchase the method of charge immediate future bill service plan usage or other information. The consent generated using the systems and methods discussed herein is recorded and stored by at least the telecommunications service provider and the application through which the request is made. This consent may be used to generate an audit trail to show compliance with government mandates associated with the use of short codes to track opt ins and the purchase information associated with premium service requests may be based in part on the short code involved in the request to purchase premium services. The purchase information may also be associated with a service plan type a requesting device type an operating system version a type of premium services requested and a cost or a range of cost options associated with consenting to purchase of the premium services.

In an embodiment an aggregation a set of APIs act as an intermediary between user equipment and applications stored on the user equipment and the telecommunications service providers APIs. This aggregation shelters the telecommunications service providers information and systems as well as provides a standard interface for content providers. Content providers may be vendors and developers of IP messaging applications or other applications including telecommunications service providers. Content providers may comprise third parties other than telecommunications service providers such as retail sports entertainment or other entities that may offer services and opportunities to UE users based on user profiles associated with IP messaging applications or other information. These offers may be made by way of an IP messaging application. In one example a sports organization may have playoff packages that include tickets to the game or games hotel airfare and a meet and greet with players. The sports organization contracts with another party for example an owner or developer of an IP messaging application to present this offer to users by way of the messaging application. This offer falls outside of the services applications included in service plans so a user would have to opt in and receive a notification of the additional charges as well as confirm acceptance consent to the additional charges. In some embodiments a user may have the option of opting in to all offers presented by the third party and or through the IP messaging application based upon a previous confirmation as discussed in detail below.

In an embodiment a user receives an offer from a content provider that includes a short code enters copies this short code in a message built using an IP messaging application stored on their UE and the IP messaging application sends the message including the short code and information associated with the sending UE. The IP messaging application sends the received message to an API aggregator which may be referred to as an industry aggregator gateway IAG . The IAG comprises a plurality of APIs associated with a plurality of telecommunications service providers and comprises an application that receives the message from the IP messaging application. The IAG determines based on the short code and the information associated with the sending UE which telecommunications service provider is associated with the UE by determining the device from which the request originated. In some embodiments the IAG may send a message to the IP messaging application on the UE to request a security token that may be used for authentication. A security token may be obtained from the UE for example from a secure memory partition or secure element of the UE by the IAG. The security token may be assigned based upon previous opt ins from the same IP messaging application or by other means and may be periodically refreshed. The security token may be used to verify the identity of the requesting device for example using the ISS and TMG discussed below and or may be used to automatically approve purchase request from IP messaging applications based upon previous opt ins from the same device same IP messaging application making the request the short code the type of purchase request etc.

In one example when no token is available the IAG may initiate a process to 1 obtain consent to the purchase of premium services and 2 store record that consent to comply with government regulations and corporate procedures. The IAG may first determine based upon information received from the IP messaging application that includes information about the UE from which the request was sent the telecommunications service provider associated with the UE. Once this determination is made the IAG may communicate with the identity service system ISS associated with that telecommunications service provider. The ISS may provide based on the short code a plurality of purchase information to be sent to the IP messenger application. This purchase information is displayed for the user to approve and comprises the information including cost or service plan usage information that the user reads before consenting opting in to the purchase. In an embodiment the ISS may receive a user entered passcode and validate that the passcode is associated with the UE based upon links between the UE and a plurality of information stored in the ISS including a previously stored passcode which may be stored in information associated with a user account associated with the UE.

In some cases opting in to a purchase in a particular IP messaging application may enable further purchases based upon a security token or other form of authorization. The ISS provides the information to the IAG and the presence assignment of a token may be based upon a service plan associated with the UE or previous requests associated with the UE and or user account associated with the UE that may be associated with the IP messaging application or other applications by the same content provider. For example if the service plan allows for 10 worth of purchases each billing cycle before charging the user or counting it against an allotment this may cause a different piece or pieces of purchase information to be sent to the IAG than a service plan that does not have such a caveat. Once the purchase information is sent to the IAG the IAG routes the information to the IP messaging application which presents the purchase information to the user at least on the requesting UE in order to obtain consent for the purchase of premium services. The IP messaging application may store and record the consent and may also forward the consent to the IAG. The IAG may send this consent for example in the form of a receipt to a telecommunications message gateway TMG associated with the telecommunications service provider and or to the ISS. In some embodiments the TMG may route the consent message to the ISS or vice versa. The consent message and associated thread of approvals may be stored by the telecommunications service provider in an option records database as well. The user is then either charged in real time or receives the charge including plan usage on their bill during a subsequent billing cycle.

In an embodiment the TMG is configured to send and receive messages to and from the IAG for example via the gateway application and communicates with both the ISS and a data store comprising option records via the network . The option records data store comprises a plurality of option or opt in records which indicate the IP messaging applications or other applications that based on a user account stores previous opt in confirmations receipts for auditing purposes. In some embodiments the ISS may be employed to confirm a security token and the identity of the requesting UE. The TMG may communicate with the ISS to retrieve information based on a request from the IAG and in alternate embodiments the ISS may communicate with the TMG based on a request from the IAG .

In an embodiment the ISS comprises a plurality of data stores and is associated with the same telecommunications service provider that is associated with the TMG . The ISS comprises a plurality of information regarding UE users including device type make model phone number MSDN ISDN number and other identifying information for UE and the users of the UE as well as links between the UE and the users. In an embodiment these links are part of user accounts and or user profiles associated with the account and a service plan may also be associated with linked to each account that indicates the allotment of types of services voice data etc. as well as a pre or post use payment plan. The ISS may also comprise a plurality of purchase information associated with the short codes as discussed in detail below.

In an embodiment the IAG is configured to receive requests from applications stored on various types of UE including IP messaging applications . In an embodiment a content provider provides an opportunity to purchase a premium service to a user of a UE via an IP messaging application . The opportunity may be presented on a graphic user interface of the UE within the application and may include a short code. The user may click on a link that generates a message within the IP messaging application or may generate a message within the IP messaging application and enter or paste the short code into the message. The IP messaging application may transmit that message along with a plurality of information associated with the UE to the IAG . The plurality of information may comprise user accounts opt in policies and consent tracking policies associated with the telecommunications provider since different providers may design different opt in and consent tracking policies that are compliance to federal regulations and that may impact what purchase information discussed below and subsequent reminders are displayed to the requesting UE . Opt in policies may be the policies associated with users opting in to additional charges plan usage either within or beyond their service plan limits and consent tracking policies may be associated with the process of proving consent including how consent is tracked and stored.

The gateway application may determine a telecommunications service provider associated with the UE based on the plurality of information associated with the UE which may include a telephone number or other device ID. This information may be employed to search for stored links and associations between the UE and a telecommunications service provider that supports the UE. Based on this determination the IAG may send a request for purchase information to the telecommunications service provider via its ISS which may comprise application . In an alternate embodiment the IAG may send the request for purchase information to the TMG which may provide the information directly to the IAG which it may retrieve from the ISS or may transmit the message to the ISS and the ISS then sends the purchase information back to the IAG .

In an embodiment the purchase information is looked up in a data store of the ISS using the short code to index and find sent to the IAG is determined based on the short code submitted in the request for purchase of premium services. The purchase information may be based on the short code and may differ among and between different telecommunications service providers even though short codes may be shared by two or more telecommunications service providers. In an embodiment the purchase information may comprise various advisements of charges and or plan usage incurred amount method of payment date or date range of payment current bill future bill payment installments an option to pay in installments as well as a description of the premium services included in the purchase and in some embodiments.

In some embodiments the purchase information may comprise what may not be included in the purchase future purchases add ons as well as the option for add ons to the purchase of premium services and cost plan usage associated with those add ons. In one example the request for premium services may include VIP passes to a concert for 88.88 on August 8 and the add ons may include car service bottle service or other services to from or while at the concert venue for additional charges beyond the 88.88. The purchase information provided for this request may comprise pricing for the premium services as well as add ons and may be displayed to the user in order to obtain their consent to charges opting in to charges .

In an embodiment the IP messaging application receives in response to displaying the purchase information received from the IAG a consent from the user and the IP messaging application transmits a message comprising the consent to at least one of the UE via the IP messaging application the content provider the options records the ISS and the TMG . In some embodiments only one of the ISS or TMG may receive the consent message from the IAG for example in the form of a receipt and store and or transmit the consent message to the other. Recipients of the consent message from the IAG may store the message and this opt in trail from the request for purchase of services through the receipt may be query able from data stores associated with the content provider the options records the ISS and the TMG . In an embodiment the UE receives a receipt from at least one of the IAG content provider the options records the ISS and the TMG .

In some embodiments this receipt may be stored on the UE and may comprise an executable that causes the display of a reminder and or additional information time changes venue changes etc. associated with the purchased premium services. This reminder may be displayed on the date of the event e.g. August 8 and or on a date or dates leading up to the event and may comprise a link or links to information associated with the purchased premium services event . This reminder may be displayed via the IP messaging application or by another application or service stored on the UE and in some embodiments may be displayed on more than one UE.

The purchase request may be considered complete by the telecommunications service provider and the content provider when the consent message is received by the IAG or in some embodiments it may be considered complete when the receipt is received by the UE and or the consent message is stored by at least one of the content provider the options records the ISS and the TMG . The user may see charges appear on a subsequent bill or may see service plan usage on a future bill or in real time.

In an embodiment the request sent at block may comprise the short code and a plurality of information associated with the UE . The IAG determines based on at least some of the received plurality of information a telecommunications service provider associated with the UE . The IAG may be configured to access a plurality of telecommunications networks associated with a plurality of UEs some of those providers may share short codes depending upon the short code. The IAG may links and or associations between short codes purchase information and information associated with UE and other UEs and the purchase information may be retrieved based upon these links. When the IAG determines the provider associated with the requesting device UE the IAG sends a request at block to the ISS associated with the telecommunications service provider for purchase information to transmit to the UE . This purchase information may be specific to a telecommunications service provider a service plan type a device the type of premium services requested a cost or range of cost options the IP messaging application used to transmit the request at block or combinations thereof. Different short codes may be associated with various purchase information because different text pricing and options may be associated with different premium service purchases and government or company regulations may govern what is displayed for different service types purchase amounts etc.

In an embodiment at block the ISS transmits the purchase information to the IAG . The IAG at block transmits the purchase information to the UE the IP messaging application stored on the UE displays the information to the user and an opt in confirmation of purchase message is transmitted at block to the IAG in response to a user opting in to the premium services purchase. The IAG receives the opt in consent message giving consent to charges and or plan usage and transmits this consent to the TMG at block . At block the TMG transmits a receipt to the IAG based on receiving the consent message and the IAG transmits the receipt to the UE at block

The IAG at block may transmit the receipt evidence of consent to opt in and associated charges at block to the content provider and or the ISS and at block to the options records data store that may be associated with the telecommunications service provider. In alternate embodiments the IAG may transmit the consent to the ISS . The records stored in the method may comprise not only a receipt indicating consent to purchase but a trail of each interaction and communication involving the purchase request as discussed at least at blocks above.

In some embodiments at block based on the receipt transmitted at block to the IAG a notification associated with the opt in purchase made based on the request at block may be sent to the UE . This notification sent at block may comprise a reminder associated with the purchase and or a link or other method of accessing content associated with the purchase of premium services completed using short codes in the method . The reminder may be displayed without user intervention at a later date e.g. a date associated with the purchased premium services and may comprise information or links to information associated with the purchased services such as parking early arrival venue traffic conditions or other information. In some embodiments when a receipt is received by the UE at block the user may have the option as to whether or not to opt in to further notifications and how those further notifications may be displayed. The short code sent at block is stored as a part of this trail of interactions and communications involving the system in and an audit trail of the consent process may be retrieved from any of the locations where the information was stored in blocks . In some embodiments completion of the request for purchase of premium services at block is completed when the IAG receives the consent message at block and in alternate embodiments the request is considered complete and consent obtained when the receipt is sent at any of blocks . In still other embodiments the request from block is considered complete at block when the TMG sends a confirmation to the IAG that the consent message was received.

The DSP or some other form of controller or central processing unit operates to control the various components of the UE in accordance with embedded software or firmware stored in memory or stored in memory contained within the DSP itself. In addition to the embedded software or firmware the DSP may execute other applications stored in the memory or made available via information carrier media such as portable data storage media like the removable memory card or via wired or wireless network communications. The application software may comprise a compiled set of machine readable instructions that configure the DSP to provide the desired functionality or the application software may be high level software instructions to be processed by an interpreter or compiler to indirectly configure the DSP .

The DSP may communicate with a wireless network via the analog baseband processing unit . In some embodiments the communication may provide Internet connectivity enabling a user to gain access to content on the Internet and to send and receive e mail or text messages. The input output interface interconnects the DSP and various memories and interfaces. The memory and the removable memory card may provide software and data to configure the operation of the DSP . Among the interfaces may be the USB port and the infrared port . The USB port may enable the UE to function as a peripheral device to exchange information with a personal computer or other computer system. The infrared port and other optional ports such as a Bluetooth interface or an IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless interface may enable the UE to communicate wirelessly with other nearby handsets and or wireless base stations. In an embodiment the UE may comprise a near field communication NFC transceiver. The NFC transceiver may be used to complete payment transactions with point of sale terminals or other communications exchanges. In an embodiment the UE may comprise a radio frequency identify RFID reader and or writer device.

The switches may couple to the DSP via the input output interface to provide one mechanism for the user to provide input to the UE . Alternatively one or more of the switches may be coupled to a motherboard of the UE and or to components of the UE via a different path e.g. not via the input output interface for example coupled to a power control circuit power button of the UE . The touch screen display is another input mechanism which further displays text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen display . The GPS receiver is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the UE to determine its position.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

Additionally after the system is turned on or booted the CPU may execute a computer program or application. For example the CPU may execute software or firmware stored in the ROM or stored in the RAM . In some cases on boot and or when the application is initiated the CPU may copy the application or portions of the application from the secondary storage to the RAM or to memory space within the CPU itself and the CPU may then execute instructions that the application is comprised of. In some cases the CPU may copy the application or portions of the application from memory accessed via the network connectivity devices or via the I O devices to the RAM or to memory space within the CPU and the CPU may then execute instructions that the application is comprised of. During execution an application may load instructions into the CPU for example load some of the instructions of the application into a cache of the CPU . In some contexts an application that is executed may be said to configure the CPU to do something e.g. to configure the CPU to perform the function or functions promoted by the subject application. When the CPU is configured in this way by the application the CPU becomes a specific purpose computer or a specific purpose machine.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.

I O devices may include printers video monitors liquid crystal displays LCDs touch screen displays keyboards keypads switches dials mice track balls voice recognizers card readers paper tape readers or other well known input devices.

The network connectivity devices may take the form of modems modem banks Ethernet cards universal serial bus USB interface cards serial interfaces token ring cards fiber distributed data interface FDDI cards wireless local area network WLAN cards radio transceiver cards that promote radio communications using protocols such as code division multiple access CDMA global system for mobile communications GSM long term evolution LTE worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX near field communications NFC radio frequency identity RFID and or other air interface protocol radio transceiver cards and other well known network devices. These network connectivity devices may enable the processor to communicate with the Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection it is contemplated that the processor might receive information from the network or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above described method steps. Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

The processor executes instructions codes computer programs scripts which it accesses from hard disk floppy disk optical disk these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage flash drive ROM RAM or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor is shown multiple processors may be present. Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drives floppy disks optical disks and or other device the ROM and or the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions and or non transitory information.

In an embodiment the computer system may comprise two or more computers in communication with each other that collaborate to perform a task. For example but not by way of limitation an application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of the instructions of the application. Alternatively the data processed by the application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of different portions of a data set by the two or more computers. In an embodiment virtualization software may be employed by the computer system to provide the functionality of a number of servers that is not directly bound to the number of computers in the computer system . For example virtualization software may provide twenty virtual servers on four physical computers. In an embodiment the functionality disclosed above may be provided by executing the application and or applications in a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing may comprise providing computing services via a network connection using dynamically scalable computing resources. Cloud computing may be supported at least in part by virtualization software. A cloud computing environment may be established by an enterprise and or may be hired on an as needed basis from a third party provider. Some cloud computing environments may comprise cloud computing resources owned and operated by the enterprise as well as cloud computing resources hired and or leased from a third party provider.

In an embodiment some or all of the functionality disclosed above may be provided as a computer program product. The computer program product may comprise one or more computer readable storage medium having computer usable program code embodied therein to implement the functionality disclosed above. The computer program product may comprise data structures executable instructions and other computer usable program code.
