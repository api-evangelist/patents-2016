title: Cloud connected motion sensor lighting grid
abstract: A cloud connected motion sensor lighting grid may include a wireless lighting network of coordinated lighting devices and a bridge to provide connectivity to external devices such as a cell phone, home automation system or security system. The cloud connected motion sensor lighting grid may be implemented locally with a cell phone communicating with the bridge for control, status and alerts. The cloud connected motion sensor lighting grid may operate over a cloud via an Internet connection allowing the bridge to communicate with a server on the Internet that may implement software for communicating with the wireless lighting network and to capture data detected by motion sensors in the wireless lighting network.
