title: System and method for an automated system for continuous observation, audit and control of user activities as they occur within a mobile network
abstract: A system and method monitors for fraudulent transactions relating to a mobile device. Either of first and second processing nodes places a hold on a transaction associated with the first live-data flow and the second live-data flow responsive to detection of a potentially fraudulent condition. A third processing node generates an interactive verification communication responsive to the first data associated with the first live-data flow and the second data associated with the second live-data flow to establish a validity of the transaction. The third processing node releases the hold on the transaction responsive to the interactive verification communication determining the potentially fraudulent condition relates to a non-fraudulent transaction and generates a fraud detection response responsive to the interactive verification communication determining the potentially fraudulent condition relates to a fraudulent transaction before the transaction completes.

U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 14 596 781 14 485 172 61 877 810 and 62 165 721 each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The invention relates to networks for example voice data and enterprise networks whether in real hardware form or functional virtualized clouds and more particularly to the real time analysis of a live data stream resulting in a situational deduction simultaneous to the live data transmission over those networks and as a result providing an opportunity to make effective an alert or action that now affects a set of probable outcomes before that data in transmission exits the network or becomes at rest as a stored event log record or application record of what has already happened as the only outcome.

The proliferation of internet and mobile connected devices the Internet of Things has increased network traffic volume transmission speeds and usage on communications networks. The ubiquity of device types and connections cellular wireless sensor multi SIM machine to machine and the expansion of usage types voice high definition video music data have also made it more complex to monitor and secure these networks and to conduct analysis on the traffic and content.

To accomplish this the traffic must be instrumented what data is moving across the network analyzed what is the content of the traffic and contextualized what are the implications of this so a relevant decision can be made or action taken within the available window of opportunity. This is especially so in the case of time critical security verification or revenue impacting situations and customer operational or machine to machine impacting events. Examples of such events include fraud occurring on mobile carrier networks cellular zones dropping calls above an acceptable threshold malfunctioning mobile applications or sensor devices or malicious content or agents compromising a network.

Today this network data is captured by a variety of network probes sitting inline intrusively inside the network. Network events must first complete example after a voice call is completed and goes through call teardown before they are translated into offline database records example Call Detail Records Event Detail Records . These records are extracted at regular time intervals and provided to applications in offline enterprise data centers for post event processing and analysis.

These systems can suffer from latency delays of up to 15 minutes for event data to be extracted and delivered to databases. In many cases multiple terabytes of data are written into databases posing Big Data analytical challenges when time critical results are needed. The inline hardware represents significant capital expenditures. These types of systems also provide a limited ability to respond flexibly to live conditions as the application layer is not integrated contextually within the data collection layer. Database records are not generated for some network events that may provide indications of fraud or other critical issues that must be detected.

A use case is mobile carrier fraud detection that utilizes call detail records that have been delivered to a data warehouse after the relevant network traffic or calls have been completed. Detection of fraud in this case occurs after the actual fraudulent event has occurred and in many cases the carrier has already incurred a financial loss. Any actions taken to remediate example block the caller can only be applied to the next time a relevant event appears in the network.

Increasingly fast and interconnected networks are driving more activities on to mobile devices such as phones tablets etc. Users are adopting everything from e commerce mobile health applications and mobile financial tools at a rapidly growing rate. Mobile carriers are enabling money services similar to those services provided by traditional banks using mobile devices to transfer electronic money send and receive money from one device to another and to deposit and withdraw money. This enables mobile carriers to essentially act as banks by receiving banking licenses in many parts of the world to support these mobile money transfer activities.

Just as traditional banking has a long tradition of fraud mobile money transfers are rife with opportunities to defraud users at several levels. During the issuance and provisioning of SIM cards there is the opportunity for dishonest retail agents to sell customers phony mobile wallets and applications or to register fake accounts to earn commissions. Additionally there are classic socially engineered scams to trick unsuspecting individuals out of their money by promising they ve won a lottery offering a job application for a small fee and phishing scams. These fraud situations cost mobile carriers hard dollars in reimbursements to subscribers regulatory compliance issues and brand reputation damage.

Preventing mobile money transfer fraud requires the ability to deduce with a high probability whether mobile transfers are legitimate before they are allowed to complete. Unlike today s traditional retail EFT POS systems where there is an ability to check for stolen cards or lack of funds available before the transaction is approved there is no ability in the mobile network to undertake any level of positive identification for provisioning transaction fidelity or identity assurance while the transaction is underway. Carrier fraud management systems analyze log records after transactions have been completed. This does not provide a capability to prevent a fraudulent transaction from occurring in the first place. Safeguarding mobile money transfers from fraud requires accessing the transaction during the transmission in order to provide an opportunity to interject an action to control the outcome of the transaction.

Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numbers are used herein to designate like elements throughout the various views and embodiments of a system and method for real time live data analysis of network traffic are illustrated and described and other possible embodiments are described. The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale and in some instances the drawings have been exaggerated and or simplified in places for illustrative purposes only. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the many possible applications and variations based on the following examples of possible embodiments.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there is illustrated the operational environment of the network live data real time analysis system the System according to the present disclosure. ARCHITECTURE A system and methodology results in the ability to integrate an application and its relational language processing example SQL in parallel and in real time operational unity with network signaling packet or data content network traffic as it is in transmission live data and to make situational deductions and to take action on that live data as it is being transmitted between points within a network. The usefulness here is the ability to take meaningful derived or deduced action on the information in transmission or to use such information in relationship to other situations to predictively inform of alert on alter or prepare for or shape or execute a desired outcome in advance of the live data exiting the network interception interdict adjust content or prevent an action on network activity or to stop shape alter copy redirect or release a network activity and becoming a data center log record or database application event under its normal course of business operations.

The System uses relational processing languages and techniques to enable detection of a situation in real time and in parallel to its occurrence within a network and not at a later point in time after the data has left the network for analysis based upon post event data processing which does not allow an opportunity to affect a change in outcome on that present event. The network traffic is comprised of continuous transmissions of multiple feeds of signaling and related data content live data from both homogenous and heterogeneous networks as can be found within voice communications or data networks such as those provided by mobile broadband or data communications network service providers. The System provides any network provider wireless carrier fixed wire line carrier cable operator enterprise network sensor network M2M etc. an opportunity to detect and identify target events or patterns of data flow or relationships Events occurring within its network traffic by providing a common view of these events as they occur and to automatically deduce and take predictively relevant actions or control responsive to the detection in a concurrent manner to those transmissions. The network live data real time analysis and deduction system provides the automated action in any number of fashions including but not limited to providing information to a dashboard web based or mobile device display that responds to a detected Event in parallel to the Event occurring and remaining open within the network traffic or the generation of automated alerts that may then be responded to manually or by the network.

Live data is data that is in transmission between endpoints not at rest within a database. Live data is transient data in that it exists only for that period of time it is in transmission. The term real time typically refers to the immediacy of a process or response to a query being made available in time for its usefulness. The term real time has nothing to do with the age or relevancy of the data but instead has everything to do with the timeliness of response relevant to a time period. The term real time is therefore an omni available description that introduces a time period and that needs to be qualified as real time to what Data that is time critical relates to the period of urgency or usefulness applied to it. Real time live data analysis is the time critical processing of network traffic in parallel with its transmission and before such network traffic completes its transmission and exits the network to become an already happened data event at rest.

The System provides a non intrusive process that enables data center logic to operate concurrently with the transmission before the transmission terminates and exits the network to become a data center application event and additionally provides the ability for the data warehouse system to interact in a time critical manner with the same network traffic to provide contextualization of conditions based on trends or other data. The System enables concurrent analysis and deduction of relationships and probabilities as Events occur and are transmitted as network traffic thus allowing deductive parallel operations with the concurrently occurring network traffic and its operations. The System does not reside within a data center that operates on a sequence of post event analytical functions rather it is architected as a larger network topology operating non intrusively and in parallel to the network traffic .

Within a network topology the system is able to use one or more virtual machines a virtual machine is any segmented computing context such as for example Processes Threads Virtual Machines Containers micro services Network Function Virtualization etc. as data collection devices ingestor node s connected non intrusively to network elements that provide a port mirror to non intrusively ingest network traffic live data source to dynamically and continuously decode signaling packet or data content network traffic and action such identifiable selected network traffic to trap and generate immediate alerts and additionally pass through all or such selected subject matter for further processing simultaneously with and live to the network traffic event remaining open or in transit or before the transmission exits the network and becomes a data center log record or application event. The system is in two parts consisting of one or more ingestor nodes and one or more semantic nodes . The ingestor node enables a non intrusive direct mirroring of network traffic and its content and provides protocol decoding data extraction and prescribed Event alert capabilities. The ingestor node also feeds an assigned semantic node with such prescribed traffic as required. The ingestor node non intrusively undertakes its analysis and alerts while a particular Event is occurring or in transmission.

The various rules in control that dynamically instruct ingestor nodes as to what particular protocol and information is being sought to be alerted by the System are provided by the semantic node . The semantic node provides one or more virtual machines for the purpose of collecting all or selective network traffic from the ingestor node s and enabling access to relational language processing in combination with their application use cases and variable windows of time to provide analysis and reasoned deduction of outcomes of time critical live data situations for the generation of further alerts intercept and interdiction actions semantic node s being able to affect a more desirable or predictable outcome of the network traffic before the transmission exits the network and becomes a data center log record or application event. The primary functions of the semantic node are to attach to the ingestor node for the receipt of all or some ingestor node packets for business application deductive reasoning and future dynamic updating of conditions and rules back to the ingestor node . Functions include to receive selected ingestor node packets the preparation and management of time critical processes required by use case applications to process the described use cases to provide fast in memory storage for statistical models required by a use case application to provide application visualization and system administration visualization through the visualization VM and to provide integrity check of packets mirrored to packets that exit the network.

The System has the ability to process data from the network traffic at gigabit speeds. The ingestor node filters decodes undertakes prescribed alerts and feeds selective or all network traffic into the semantic node . The semantic node undertakes application specific use case tasks including situational analysis contextual reasoning and deductive processing according to rules statistical models and if any subject matter databases attached to the semantic node .

Referring now to a more detailed illustration of the functioning of the system is provided. The System may include multiple ingestor nodes that are each capable of providing a number of functionalities by way of accessing the mirrored data flow provided by a targeted live data source. Multiple ingestor nodes are able to form a non intrusive analytical grid with regard to the desired traffic flow to be analyzed. The ingestor node is able to ingest and process mirrored network traffic at network speeds. Each of the ingestor nodes and semantic nodes use in memory database architectures C programming language and commodity servers and operating systems.

The semantic node provides rules engine functionalities visualization functionality and command and control framework to provide for an application use case execution. The rules engine visualization and command and control provide a manner for analyzing the received data according to a particular use case. Specific use cases are provided within this framework using an open application programming interface API application blade architecture that enables a user to develop and add multiple application use cases to the System . The semantic node can be expanded to incorporate SSD and hard drive databases provided they are able to perform at the time critical speeds of the live data processing. In direct relation to an embedded use case the semantic node has the ability for internal contextual evolution of the application specific statistical models by way of contextual table update and dynamically allocated stored procedures. This provides a certain amount of internally biased situational learning based on the correctness of the recommended decisions and execution of each application use case. Multiple applications can coexist and be implemented within the same semantic node and processed from the same live data input.

Referring now to there is a flow chart illustrating the operation of the system . The data flow is mirrored at step . Next at step the ingestor node ingests a mirrored copy of the network traffic provided by the live data source. Using mobile network traffic as an example the ingest VM writes the network traffic into an allocated time dependent buffer TDB at step . The protocol decoder commences decoding at step the contents of the TDB to find the protocol required. In the case of SS7 network traffic there are many protocols. The decoder checks for these protocols such as ISUP or TCAP MAP protocols. If found the decoder continues to decode and retrieves any required information that may be present such as a phone number. The process is granular in that it decodes small portions of the TDB rapidly to identify specific requirements before proceeding to decode the next set of requirements or the entire contents of the TDB. The decoded contents are passed to packet sniper for analysis in accord with a set of criteria for action at step .

If no prescribed conditions are detected control passes back to step and the process repeats. Once a particular prescribed condition is detected the ingestor node sends an alert to the semantic node or undertakes a preset action at step . This action could be to send a prescribed alert to network elements to truncate or trap and redirect that particular network traffic to other systems including the semantic node for processing. Such processing may include change of content copy of content or to create interdiction schemes for further network traffic of a like nature. All decoded network traffic is sent at step to the semantic node wherein such particular use case rules associated with any detected conditions is applied to the data.

Referring now to there are illustrated block diagrams for implementation of the system with a network packet data configuration and a FTP file based data configuration . The System causes application driven relational language processing situational analysis deduction and resulting actions to be not limited to events that have happened but to bring such situational analysis deduction and resulting actions into operational real time unity at the time of and concurrent with their live transmission. The System therefore enables understanding and calculation of relevant actions to be taken to better affect a desired outcome before closure of that opportunity by the network traffic exiting the network to become a post event log record or stored data center application event.

Referring now to there is illustrated a system block architecture for the System configured to monitor network traffic transmissions. The network traffic passes through some type of switch live data source or other network element that provides a port to mirror the data for ingestion. Within the ingestor node a pipeline packet reader ingests the mirrored network traffic passing through the switch live data source or other network element and reads all of the data passing therethrough. A packet handler within the ingestor node processes all of the packets and decodes the associated protocols of the packet using protocol decoders . A packet sniper within the ingestor node monitors for the occurrence of particular conditions or packet combinations as defined by the semantic node use cases. The information monitored for by the packet sniper is controlled by a semantic node and in memory database which provides application specific parameters traps and alerts that are to be monitored for and provided by the semantic node .

This information may be monitored for using particular statistical models implemented within the semantic node and in memory database and may additionally use additional contextual data from outside databases . The information within the semantic node and in memory database controls the operation of a rules engine that generates the appropriate responses to information detected by the packet sniper and generates various responses thereto such as email alerts visualization outputs configuration parameters and framework queries . Information within the semantic node and in memory database may also be updated through a machine learning feedback loop .

Referring now to there is illustrated the architecture for the system whereby a file server acts as a live data source port mirror and transmits FTP files to the ingestor node for processing using a parallel file reader . The System provides a file handler that processes the monitored files via a file decoder . The packet sniper within the ingestor node monitors for specific information and sends the file information to the semantic node as per the System requirements.

In a method similar to that of the live data network traffic ingest the file based information is also ingested monitored and analyzed using particular statistical models implemented within the semantic node and in memory database and may additionally use contextual data from outside databases . The information within the semantic node and in memory database controls the operation of a rules engine that generates the appropriate responses to information detected by the packet sniper and generates various responses thereto such as email alerts visualization outputs configuration parameters and framework queries . Information within the semantic node and in memory database may also be updated through a machine learning feedback loop .

The systems of provide the ability to bring application driven relational language processing situational analysis deductions and resulting actions into operational real time unity with network traffic while it is being transmitted within its associated network. Actions may then be taken on the Event to shape truncate alert or redirect before it exits the network and becomes a post Event fixed log record or data center application event.

Referring now to there is illustrated the configuration of the System within a function specific topology layered architecture. The first layer comprises the ingestor node . Each of the ingestor nodes are connected to a live data source through an associated port mirror or network interface controller port mirror that provides the ingestor nodes access to mirrored network traffic. Each of the ingestor nodes connects to a second layer which provides the semantic node . The semantic node interconnects with the ingestor node via an Ethernet or Infiniband connection .

The semantic node in layer contains the application decision matrices self learning cognitive decision support and action logic to enable execution of the desired use case outcome. Each semantic node contains the use case or pattern recognition logic to identify with instances and situations that are of interest in accordance with their use case. The semantic node provides a contextual learning loop through an independent process connecting to legacy storage and providing updates to the semantic node in parallel to the system .

Referring now to there is illustrated a functional block diagram of the methodology used for nonintrusive live data ingest at the ingestor node to the application specific situational analysis performed at the semantic node . The process provides a relational processing language driven analysis for the stated applications to occur while the Event is still open by way of its transmission within the network and thus provides the ability for real time dynamic relational processing language driven intercept adjustment of content prevention of action or interdiction to occur before the data exits the network and becomes a data center application event. This provides the opportunity to stop shape alter copy redirect or release the network activity while it is still in transit. The result is that the method allows for high data rate high volume signaling data to be analyzed in real time while it is still within the network so that certain enterprise policies controls predictive probability alerts or other actions can be applied in real time to the monitored data flow.

The live data source provides network traffic structured or unstructured to the ingestor node for decoding and identification. Upon ingestion by the ingestor node the network traffic is sent to the protocol decoder that decodes and identifies each wanted protocol packet and discretizes such wanted decoded network traffic as packets into a time dependent buffer TDB as allocated by the time dependent buffer VM TDB VM . The TDB VM is a semaphore based internal memory allocation manager for the ingestor node that assists in the integrity of memory allocation and release to ensure that both locked and lockless operations can occur in parallel in real time as needed and without clash. This memory is allocated and distributed at arbitrary lengths based on need via a variable length bitmap . The address of each newly loaded TDB is passed to a process whereby prescribed or deduced events are looked for in packet sniper .

The packet sniper compares the decoded data to certain conditions of interest as indicated by the prescribed rules provided by the semantic node or by deduced conditions determined by the contextual data and feedback loop learning loop undertaken by the semantic node . The packet sniper provides positive indications upon detection of these conditions. On completion of its search each packet sniper releases its previously allocated TDB to the ingestor node memory manager for use by other parallel current tasks or future operations that could be requested or introduced to the ingestor node . The TDB allows a no lock variable time latency multiprocessing of each packet by the ingestor node and the capability for locked operation in the eventuality of write functions being required to change the contents of packets. The packet sniper further counts the number of packets that are received from the decoder and provides this as a packet count indication . The packet count is used to verify live event network traffic flow with post event network traffic records providing a network transmission integrity check for network operations. The packets of interest detected by the packet sniper are referenced against an action table by the ingestor node and such prescribed action is executed. Network traffic of interest is flagged and sent to the semantic node for application based processing. Selected or all network traffic flows to the application relevancy filter within the semantic node these are provided for longer term storage or transferred to legacy data or discard . Relevant network traffic is passed to the application rules engine for further analysis to determine the actions required based upon the detected data.

The application rules engine initiates particular actions and interventions in accord with each application use case deduction and initiates the desired analytic outcome s . The application rules engine may also provide information to enable contextual updates with live data events and actions at in addition to the ability to enable manual input output as part of the learning loop at step . The determined actions and interventions at drive contextual updates with live data events and actions that occur at . The actions and interventions are used to execute particular actions at or to provide information to the grid manager within the ingestor node . The contextual update with live data events and actions at enable the creation of visualization and notifications of live data alerts and other metrics to provide necessary notifications at step . The contextual update with live data events and actions also provides information for storage and application specific static and dynamic statistical model and provides information to the activity and packet count journal . They also enable adjustment to the conditions rules and actions which are passed back to ingestor node and packet sniper to provide dynamic and deducted additions to those prescribed by the use case. The visualization and notification of live data alerts and other metrics execute an action at or alternatively or additionally enact live output to dashboards or data integration with other systems such as email SMS etc. at . After the executed actions at are caused to occur unwanted packets are discarded at . Information generated responsive to the activities are stored within the packet count journal .

Each use case provides the control information that controls the operation of its respective processes within the semantic node and ingestor node . Each blade may be associated with a particular use case such that a particular condition or operation may be monitored and detected by the ingestor node and semantic node . Multiple blades may be utilized such that different use cases may be implemented by the system on the same network traffic in parallel in a multithreaded fashion.

Referring now to there is illustrated the topical data flow through the ingestor and semantic nodes. A packet source is associated with a particular network traffic and may be read by a live data source reader within the ingestor node . Additionally various files may be read by a live data source reader configured for reading files. Reading data from and can be enacted simultaneously. The data read by the data source readers and are processed by data handlers which utilize a number of data decoders in order to decode data from the various data readers and .

The data handler generates various sources of semantic data . This data is provided to a semantic data writer so that it may be written to a semantic data application program interface . The API provides the data to the semantic node and in memory database that contains application specific parameters traps and alerts that are generated responsive to various statistical models relating to received Events within the semantic node . Various alerts and reports are generated responsive to the semantic node and in memory database operations.

Referring now to there is more particularly illustrated a block diagram of the various virtual machine functions that make up the ingestor node . The primary functions of the ingestor node are to attach the System to a live data source for the purpose of receiving mirrored data from that source then decoding and preprocessing before forwarding to the semantic node . The ingestor node attaches to the live data source through a live data source port mirror or other non intrusive method that enables access to data as a parallel observe and duplicate process and not by being a network element step of pass through stop copy forward . Each ingestor node is able to directly communicate with its peer nodes in a grid and with an assigned semantic node . The ingestor node feeds information to its assigned semantic node for use case application analysis and deduction. The ingestor node provides peer to peer communications.

The ingestor node consists of four agents able to operate independently and in parallel 1 the ingest VM 2 the governor VM 3 the time dependent buffer TDB VM and 4 the grid VM . The ingest VM ingests the mirrored network traffic undertakes protocol decoding acquires a TDB and discretizes and writes the required packetized data to the assigned TDB. The protocol decoder process within the ingest VM uses an informational map that the ingestor node uses for the dynamic allocation of threads and cores to decode one or potentially more protocol packets in parallel.

A network packet may contain multiple protocols. For example an internet protocol IP packet may include web traffic HTTP mail SMTP internet phone VOIP file transfer FTP and network monitor SNMP amongst others. When the protocol decoder tells the ingestor node to decode HTTPs SMTP FTP protocols the protocol decoder collects information on both the sender and the target servers. The ingestor node allocates three threads each operating on its assigned protocol and all three threads run in parallel to more readily operate on the packet. The design of the protocol decoder is lockless and a read only operation. As an example a decoded packet within a TDB VM could be analyzed by three or more protocol decoders independently in parallel and with no fixed ordering. Thus the HTTP decoder would perform a bit comparison to determine if there were an HTTP page request within the packet retrieve the target server name and place the information within the semantic data queue. The SMTP decoder would perform a bit comparison to determine if there were an SMTP send mail within a packet retrieve the mail server name and sender and place the information within the semantic data queue. The FTP decoder would perform a bit comparison to determine if there were an SMTP PASV within the packet retrieve the mail server name and place the information within the semantic data queue. Each protocol decoder would independently release its use of its allocated TDB VM .

The ingest VM also includes one or more packet sniper process es for providing multi threaded parallel comparisons for prescribed or deduced conditions. The packet sniper process also includes the information that the ingestor node uses for allocation of threads and or cores to analyze per data type along with where and or how to generate alerts to the semantic node . Similar to the protocol decoders multiple packet sniper processes can be enacted on any assigned TDB each process releasing its interest in the TDB when finished. The conditions being sought by packet sniper processes are set up by the semantic node or may optionally be established by direct input to the ingest VM . The ingest VM is also able to simultaneously transmit selected or all data to the semantic node .

In one example a decoded SS7 packet contains the phone number of a caller and the phone number of a call recipient. To address the requirement of alerting when caller 1234567890 makes calls to any number and to alert when called number 1900PREMIUM receives calls from any number the packet sniper configuration tells the ingestor node of these two separate operations with respect to an outgoing sniper and an incoming sniper. The ingestor node allocates two packet snipers each operating on its assigned task and within its own in memory database or assigned TDB VM . Each thread runs in parallel and independently with no fixed ordering and will operate on a decoded packet. When the outgoing sniper matches the caller number to a caller blacklist in its in memory database an alert will be generated. Similarly if the incoming sniper matches a called number to a called blacklist within its memory database the packet sniper generates an alert. Packet sniper will independently release use of its TDB VM .

The governor VM acts as a performance watchdog with the ability to organize core and or memory availability of the ingest VM responsive to its detected conditions. The dynamic allocation and release of multiple TDB VM allows multiple functions of disparate timing to be scheduled by the ingest VM so that optimum memory availability is provided to those functions. The TDB VM provides the ingestor node with the ability to use memory efficiently in concert with the speed of ingest and any disparate ingestor node processing. The TDB VM uses a combination of semaphores and arbitrary memory mapping dynamically responding to allocation of memory requests. The TDB VM allows for the efficient use and tuning of memory based upon time required and size needed. Multiple ingestor node tasks and VMs are able to request workspace of varying need and time. TDB VM flags the required memory blocks. These can be flagged as a lock or no lock status. The flagged memory can then be used in parallel by multiple tasks in read only mode and dynamically locked if in write mode. Each task releases its need for the memory block on completion of its task. The final release will release that memory block back to the TDB VM for further use. TDB VM is able to allocate as a single block of memory non contiguous blocks grouped as a virtual contiguous allocations of memory.

This memory management is illustrated for three simultaneously operating processes in . illustrates four separate tasks that are occurring in parallel within the same TDB as allocated by the TDB VM . The processes search for the next available data packet at step for decoding. Step checks if all packets have been received and if not control passes back to step to get the next packet for decoding. As packets are decoded and identified they are placed into requested TDBs. Control passes to step and the addresses of buffered packets are passed to the packet sniper or other ingest VM tasks. Packet sniper analyzes the buffered data comparing it for triggers of interest to its sniper list at step to determine if any relevant conditions are detected. If a trigger is detected an alert is executed at step and in parallel any recorded action beyond a trigger is also executed. If no trigger is detected at inquiry step or following an alert or action executed at step the contents of the data packets are forwarded on to the semantic node at step and that interest in that TDB memory is released by packet sniper back to TDB VM at step . An action at step could be to change the contents of that packet content or to alert a network operations center to truncate the transmission of that Event or to trigger other events that may or may not activate intercept or interdiction processes. As can be seen the same data packets can be monitored in three separate use cases that are each monitoring for different types of information in the same manner. Governor VM monitors the timeliness of disparate use cases as to their use of the same memory buffer for different purposes in relationship to the overall memory available for allocation by the TDB VM .

Referring now to there is illustrated the process flow of an ingestor node with respect to each of the virtual machines described herein above. The ingest VM uses a packet capture agent at to allocate available cores and request allocation of TDB from the TDB VM . If a TDB is not available the threshold alarm is generated at step . If a TDB is available the mirror of the network traffic is copied and processed at . Protocol decoders at ingest the mirrored packets to determine if the packets are wanted. Unwanted packets are discarded at step .

Thus from the port mirror the network traffic can be copied in parallel to its transmission into one or more of the allocated TDBs and made available to one or more of assigned scheduled cores of the ingest VM and by using variable bitmap searching the required protocols are decoded and recognized or the required patterns are recognized at step . The address of TDBs containing wanted protocols packets patterns are passed to packet sniper and other such tasks for further processing or inspection. The TDB VM process monitors the availability of memory blocks and presents the available status to the ingest VM . The ingest VM schedules the sending of the ingested data to the semantic node in parallel scheduling routines through the packet sniper that compares data for preselected alerts or actions at inquiry step . Once a TDB is fully released and its contents transmitted at step to the semantic node the now available TDB addresses are returned at step to the TDB VM memory map as being available. Control will then pass back to step .

If the packet sniper does not detect a comparison match at inquiry step control passes to step to determine if different content exists. If so additional comparisons are performed at step . If no further comparison data is available control passes to steps and wherein the packet sniper journal is updated at step and the memory associated with the compared data is released and the TDB VM memory map updated at step . The TDB VM does not clear buffers for use until every task has issued a clear status on that TDB .

Packet sniper is engaged when each ingest VM has completed its loading of live data from the allocating core. The packet sniper is responsive to dynamic or deduced updates received from the semantic node at . This update information enables the packet sniper to target particular content and or situations. This information is stored within a target content and or situation file that controls the operation of the packet sniper . Packet sniper analyses the contents of the TDB for content or conditions that have already been determined as being of interest at inquiry step as well as updated deduced conditions from step . If found packet sniper performs predetermined action triggers at that can either execute within the ingestor node or defer to the semantic node . If inquiry step determines that a match does exist the action associated with the match is executed at step and an alert is generated to the semantic node at step . Packet sniper will then continue its searches at step .

The role of the governor VM is to monitor and maintain the preset performance levels of core usage and memory space available to all virtual machines and tasks within their host ingestor node . Assigned cores that operate at a higher percent busy value or excessive memory usage cause an alarm to be sent to the semantic node for diagnostic records and alerts.

The governor VM measures the time periods of the ingestor node . This comprises measuring the time taken for the TDB VM the packet sniper s and other tasks to complete their operations and additionally ensuring that memory usage is not growing beyond a certain threshold. The governor VM operates in parallel to all of the other virtual machines in the ingestor node and engages dynamic performance balancing of available cores and memory should processes start to encroach on preset or dynamically set hurdles. The performance gathering data of the governor VM is logged and sent at regular intervals to the semantic node for journal entry at . The governor VM also acts as the entry point for executing messaging from the grid VM and command and control functions from the assigned semantic node . The governor VM determines at inquiry steps whether there has been a grid VM condition set or an internal performance breach. When a grid VM condition or performance breach is detected the governor VM undertakes reallocation of priorities and resources as provided by the resident operating system and utilities at step and at step . Governor VM undertakes similar actions when receiving command control update or diagnostic instructions by the assigned semantic node .

As a result of a threshold alarm the governor VM commences working with the operating system and TDB VM to reassign other cores and memory of a lower priority and to allocate the newly available resources to assist in reducing the workload of other cores. Thus in a situation where cores running ingest or decode or packet sniper tasks approached a set threshold level of for example 70 and or the amount of available memory for allocation to those tasks in the TDB also reached a threshold level of for example not less than 20 the governor VM would a attempt to reassign or cease lower priority work b attempt to increase available memory in the TDB and c inform the assigned semantic node of the condition.

The role of the grid VM is to manage for its host ingestor node the intercommunications between peer ingestor nodes and thereby the intercommunications between multiple semantic nodes . Based on use case performance requirements it is possible to configure any number of ingestor nodes and semantic nodes into an analytical grid architecture. Thus the grid VM receives inter ingestor node notification at and makes notes of these indications at . The grid VM is also able to send notifications to other ingestor nodes at . The data within the grid VM is referred to as map of operations and contains a role both within the grid and within the node. The grid VM enables notification of dynamic conditions and required action among various ingestor nodes within a set of Systems .

Referring now to there is more particularly illustrated the semantic node . The semantic node provides a use case application environment for time critical situational analysis contextual deduction decision support and follow up action as dictated by the use case applications defined within that semantic node working within a required window of time set by the application in regard to any desired result remaining relevant to its opportunity to effect change or alert. The semantic node is able to inform other network elements or outside data processing environments of conditions within the System and additionally request or send determined intercept or interdiction commands that are in accord with the application.

The semantic node provides a framework for time critical situational analysis decision support deduction and action processing of multiple use applications with regard to the live data packets sent by the ingestor node . In some cases this may require the use case application to access various other data such as legacy data center records or to send alerts or to seek action that may require the servicing of the use case application s needs to include non live data access to data storage outside the System .

The decision accuracy and situational relevancy of semantic node is continually updated through the recording of actions and alerts within the action and alerts database . The actions and alerts are deemed to be correct non correct through programmatic access to data center records and the subsequent reformulation of statistical subject matter used in decision support situational analysis. The semantic node consists of three processes that operate dynamically and independently to form the rules engine . These include the application blade manager visualization VM and self learning loop . A semantic node further includes two virtual machines agents including a grid VM and governor VM . The grid VM and governor VM operate in the same fashion discussed herein above with respect to the ingestor node and provide the same functionalities. Queries to the semantic node can be dynamically and programmatically executed responsive to use case application control or may also be learned through matrices input and defined or external machine big data input including statistical models and pattern recognition.

The visualization VM provides the framework to drive dashboards visual analysis tool or data presentation media reporting in real time to the activities being undertaken or their results and provides an operational command and control entry point to the System .

Referring now to there is illustrated a manner of operation of an application blade manager . The application blade manager is responsible for managing and providing control based upon the various use case applications defined in use case application blades within the semantic node . The application blade manager runs at an individual application blade associated with a use case application to execute the customer use case algorithm. Input to the modular application blade is received from the process at step from data provided from the ingestor node for a specific window from user supplied run parameters and from related historical and static data . Each of these is received as input to the modular application blade at step . Next at step the use case algorithm is executed as a series of dependent ordered steps using the provided data. The algorithm concludes at step rendering a set of outcomes. These outcomes may be used to provide GUI reports alerts and use case related displays on a dashboard as indicated at . Additionally the outcomes may be used to provide processing metrics at run time at . Finally the outcomes may provide at known unlabeled data from the user algorithm.

This known unlabeled data may be used to determine the statistical accuracy of customer algorithm results at step or provide customer analyst label outcomes at step . The customer analyst label outcomes may provide known data with labeled responses at step which may be used to derive an action list for the ingestor node at step . Inquiry step determines if there is a learned classification algorithm based upon the labeled responses. If not the machine learning algorithm builds a classification model using the labeled responses as a training data set at step . If so the machine learned algorithm is run against data for validation to calculate the statistical accuracy at step . At step a comparison of the accuracy and speed of the machine learned algorithm against the statistical accuracy of the customer algorithm may be based upon the result from step and the statistical accuracy of customer algorithm results at step . All this information is used to generate a report outcome to the graphical user interface as a customer inquiry at step . Additionally this outcome is used to calculate the deduced conditions which are provided back to the ingestor node and packet sniper .

Referring now to there is provided an illustration of the operation of a semantic node user application blade. A particular application blade is selected at step and the associated information related to the blade is read. Next at inquiry step the applications assigned to the use case application are determined. The assigned application information is forwarded to the resource manager to assign the core memory requirements necessary for executing the application. The application assignments are based upon load parameters that are provided to the application assignment process and selected from the number of available applications that may be utilized. Each application has various operational tasks associated therewith. The resource manager will start the selected applications at . The started applications may comprise any number of applications and execution of the applications will generate a decision to either flush or save data that is being analyzed by the use case application at . These decisions to flush or save data are provided to action profiles that identify particular actions to be taken depending upon the decisions made by the applications . Additionally the decisions may be provided to a graphical user interface for display of information in the form of alerts or other dashboard activities or the information may be stored within a journal for later or further analysis. The action profile information may be forwarded to the load parameters block for further action or stored within a learning database . The various applications that are implemented may utilize information from existing databases such as metadata applications statistical model or the learning database .

The system described herein above with respect to may be implemented in a number of manners in order to provide real time monitoring of live data flowing through such associated live data sources and other network elements. Various applications in which the methodology may be utilized include business assurance applications customer experience applications network operations applications and network security applications. Various business assurance applications include ways for monitoring and confirming that a business model implemented by a system is operating in a known and desired manner. These applications include international roaming fraud Wangiri inbound calls text messages SMS international revenue share country or number callout fraud SMS fraud SMS spam whitelisting SLA service level agreement verification shared services fraud management monitoring shared services fraud threat aggregation and alerting M2M mobile to mobile usage fraud monitoring SIM subscriber identification module cloning interconnect bypass SIM box usage fraud phishing farming stolen device IMEI international mobile equipment identity hotlist femto cell fraud detection subscriber fraud detection mobile payment system monitoring content distribution SLA monitoring network event verification for revenue assurance real time margin calculations for subscriber profitability interconnect charges verification PBX corporate account hacking mobile banking 2 Factor authentication fraud detection mobile churn protection head off.

This methodology may also be utilized in a number of applications for controlling and managing customer experience. These include things such as bill shock management social network analysis for churn avoidance identification of non optimal network conditions and immediately notifying or offloading subscribers for amelioration high value subscribers and the provision of granularized service to them for things such as dropped calls wireless offloading for congestion dynamic notifications for network outages All You Can App customized tariff plans based on personalized application usage and social network analysis for individualized experiences.

With respect to network operations applications the system methodology can provide an intelligent network planning to prioritize plan optimize investments ahead of a demand curve provide subscriber centric wireless offload based on contextual intelligence provide congestion control at the granular level provide core instrumentation and alerting provide traffic management provide instrumentation for circuit measurements detect silent dropped calls calculate answer ratios real time control and alerts and to provide for data session quality of service monitoring and control. In one example the System receives outage plans for cell towers and commences monitoring in conjunction with a live data source the presence movement and activities of such mobile devices or devices within that nominated cell tower transmission area. A file is built in real time to that monitoring and a usage map is dynamically built. The map is used to selectively alert through SMS email or other such contact methods such dynamic situations or planned outages creating a just in time dynamic alert system based in real time to the live data deductions.

Finally with respect to network security applications the system methodology enables analysis of live data network traffic for the purpose of identifying malicious content or agents as they enter the network at any determined location or between two or more points in applications packets on devices or network elements. This identification and detection in concert with the packet sniper capabilities of automated alert and prescribed or dynamic deduced actions can isolate trap or reject the passage of such threats from further movement through or into the network or out of the network into further onwards data centers or enterprise systems . While each of these various applications of the described methodology are only examples thereof it would be appreciated by one skilled in the art that various other implementations of the methodology in accordance with the general process described herein may also be implemented.

Referring now to there are more particularly described implementations of various applications utilizing the methodology described herein with respect to . is a flow diagram relating to a use of the system for detection of international roaming fraud. Perpetrators of international roaming fraud make international calls on stolen or purchased SIM cards with no intention of paying the roaming charges. Perpetrators steal SIM cards and make international calls or calls to premium numbers leaving a large unpaid bill. In other occurrences perpetrators purchase large blocks of SIM cards from the carrier country roam out of country and use the cards to call their own premium numbers profiting off the calls and leaving the roaming charges to be absorbed by the carrier. The present methodology would make use of the roaming data files provided by the roaming data file syndicator. This data may be used to detect patterns indicative of roaming fraud.

The System can detect the number of outgoing calls from a single roaming subscriber to one or more international numbers at step . Next a determination is made at inquiry step as to whether the number of outgoing calls from a single roaming subscriber to one or more international numbers has exceeded a user configurable threshold and if so whether this has occurred within a user configurable period of time at inquiry step . If the number of outgoing calls has exceeded the threshold within the configured time period alarms with associated reports may be generated at step . The alarm may be used to indicate to the network provider that an outgoing call threshold from the specified roaming subscriber number has been exceeded and further scrutiny is necessary. A drill down report generated along with the alarm is made available for the network provider that will list the international numbers that are being called. If inquiry steps and determine that the configurable call numbers or time periods have not been exceeded control passes back to step to continue monitoring the roaming data at step . Outcomes from are integrated with external contextual data at and this information is utilized by the semantic node to calculate dynamic changes to any parameters relevant to the use case.

Referring now to there is illustrated a manner in which the methodology may be used for detecting Wangiri fraud. Owners of premium numbers may drive traffic to their numbers by calling unsuspecting subscribers or sending them SMS messages to lure or trick them into calling the premium number. This is referred to as Wangiri fraud and frequently occurs over the weekend between Friday evening and Monday morning or during holidays when there are fewer people staffing the carrier network and thus making it less likely they will notice traffic spikes indicating possible fraud. Subscribers will receive inbound calls from what may at first glance appear to be a local number. In some cases the calls are brief and the recipient hears a baby crying or a woman screaming. After the call is disconnected the subscriber will call back out of concern. In other cases recipients may have missed the call during the night and will return it in the morning under the presumption that the call must have been important. In another variant subscribers will receive an SMS message informing them that they have won a prize or have a gift to be delivered and they must call a number to arrange delivery. The customer calls the number which is again an international premium number.

The methodology uses data sources consulted by the semantic node that include known revenue share fraud databases or threat lists that have been built based on past calling behavior carrier fraud and threat databases. In using the methodology of to detect Wangiri fraud the system detects multiple calls SMS messages from a single number or range or an excessive number of calls SMS messages at step . The allowable number of SMS messages or calls is a user configurable number. It is determined at inquiry step whether the configured number of call or SMS message number has been exceeded and whether this exceeded number has occurred within the user configured time period at inquiry step . If so alarms with associated reports may be generated at step . Otherwise the system continues monitoring at step until a problem condition is detected. Any outcome from is integrated with external contextual data at and this information is utilized by the semantic node to calculate dynamic changes to any parameters relevant to the use case. This includes packet sniper conditions for alert or action statistical or risk scoring models and or additional information that can be provided back to the network carrier to enhance the alert or report contents at . Examples include customer billing records to determine how the subscriber s current balance may affect their perceived risk in real time social analysis of calling maps to determine circles of subscribers involved with suspicious network activity or contrasting the live network activity with the subscriber s normal behavioral patterns to determine if an outlier or anomaly has been detected.

The reports generated in response to detection of this condition would include updates of all current fraud events updated with all victims who have received SMS or phone calls. The reports would show common numbers any victims are calling back in order to identify the callback numbers of the SMS attacks. The reports would further provide real time calculations of KPIs and savings in the dashboard to show cost call of each return call so analysts can track savings from the time the callback number is barred to customers. This will calculate how much it would have cost the customer had the Wangiri fraud not been identified and stopped. Thus a particular savings benefit can be numerically defined for customers and the network provider.

Another type of fraud which may be detected by the system is International Revenue Share fraud. This type of fraud involves perpetrators making calls to international premium numbers on stolen or purchased SIM cards from within the carrier network. This type of fraud has two subtypes. Within the number callout scenario subscribers call international premium numbers as evidenced by a sudden high number of outbound calls to a small range of destinations. This could indicate the usage of stolen SIMs or SIMs purchased with no intention to pay the full contract bill. In this case there is no correlated inbound trigger of calls from an international number as in Wangiri Fraud and the calls are placed from within the carrier network unlike the international roaming fraud. In the country callout scenario a high number of calls are suddenly placed to a specific country. These calls exceed the normal baseline call rates and the calls are placed from within the carrier network. External data sources may be consulted by the semantic node in order to access known revenue sharing databases threat lists that have been built on past calling behavior carrier fraud and threat databases.

The calling patterns are detected in the manner illustrated in . With respect to the number callout scenario the cumulative minutes from a single A number to any B number in any country is first detected at step . Inquiry step determines if the cumulative minutes exceed a user defined threshold level and if so inquiry step determines whether the cumulative minutes exceed a call count from a single A number to any B number in any of the countries within a configurable time period. If so an alert and associated report may be generated at step . If the cumulative minutes have not been exceeded within a configured time period or the call count has not been exceeded within a configured time period the cumulative minutes are further monitored at step to continue monitoring for possible issues. Any outcome from is integrated with external contextual data at and this information is utilized by the semantic node to calculate dynamic changes to any parameters relevant to the use case.

Referring now to in the country callout configuration at step the cumulative minutes from a carrier network to a specific country are first detected and inquiry step determines whether these cumulative minutes exceed a predetermined threshold within a defined time limit. If so a further determination is made at step whether the cumulative minutes involve an excessive call count threshold within a defined time period. If so this causes the generation of alerts and reports at step . If the threshold call limit or call count are not exceeded at step and respectively control passes back to step to continue monitoring for issues. Any outcome from is integrated with external contextual data at and this information is utilized by the semantic node to calculate dynamic changes to any parameters relevant to the use case. Both the semantic node and the data in enable adjustments to the input parameters to adjust for the live data conditions of the network. In the case of country specific thresholds this dynamic input enables variations to account for regular network baselines which days of the week are highest lowest traffic to and from each country for example as well as unexpected or uncontrollable factors such as world events natural disasters terror attacks religious holidays that prompt an unusual surge of traffic to or from specific locations.

The drilldown reports provided at and respectively can provide updates on the configurable time period of each fraud event. Reports may also provide a summary of each fraud alert for immediate scanning by an analyst enabling them to determine how many A numbers B numbers cumulative duration etc. The reports may also provide risk scoring of each alert based upon a configurable set of questions e.g. are 90 of calls being answered are majority of calls 2 minutes plus . The report may also provide risk scoring of each alert based upon an external big data contextualization do any A numbers in this alert have a current balance owing greater than X . The alert generation may comprise the provision of an application program interface to customer billing and customer profile information as at and . Finally calling maps may be generated to show the relationship between anyone involved in the fraud event showing all activity for the past 48 hours. These external data sources can be linked to semantic node for ongoing automatic adjustment or feedback to the use case rules and can inform packet sniper in ingestor node to be aware of specific subscribers phone numbers relationships patterns thresholds or other factors that when encountered in the network traffic will be automatically alerted on or actions instructions sent to other systems. Examples include communications to network operations to terminate a call bar a specific subscriber prevent outbound calls to a specific phone number all of these are actions to alter the specific activity as it is detected. This enables the carrier to prevent the losses from being incurred by intercepting the fraudulent activity before or while it happens.

Referring now to there is illustrated the manner in which the system may detect inbound SMS fraud. Within the SMS fraud situation subscribers receive SMS messages designed to trick them into either calling international premium numbers or clicking on links designed to phish for usernames and passwords to give access to private information. The system may detect inbound SMS messages at step that come from a particular international number or range of numbers. The determination is made at inquiry step whether the number of SMS messages exceeds a configurable limit established by the system. If so an alert and associated report may be generated at step . If a selected number of SMS messages has not been exceeded control passes to inquiry step which determines if an allowable number of responding subscribers who have received the SMS message have dialed a same international number greater than a configurable threshold number of times within a configurable time period. If so a report and alert are generated at step . If not control passes to step and SMS messages will continue to be monitored. To enhance this ongoing monitoring external contextual data is integrated at and this information is utilized by the semantic node to calculate dynamic changes to any parameters relevant to the use case. In this case the contextual data enables for example correlation to identify common numbers being dialed even if those numbers did not originate the inbound spam so that action can be taken to bar monitor or otherwise take action on parties involved in a fraud event as it is happening.

Referring now to there is illustrated the manner in which the system may be used to ensure service level agreement compliance. Various service level agreement SLA parameters are monitored in real time at step and a determination is made whether all parameters are met. When inquiry step determines that certain parameters are not met an alert flag is generated at step . If the parameters are met control returns to step to continue monitoring the parameters. An example of this would be if international roaming files must be generated and submitted to a syndicate service within 4 hours of a call closure. The system automatically checks for SLA compliance and flags any roaming file that is not compliant so that it can be diverted to billing systems department so that it is not paid back to the roaming carrier.

Referring now to there is illustrated the manner in which the system may be used to provide real time live data usage verification and notification in order to prevent bill shock for subscribers. Carriers must provide subscribers with up to date data usage information so that subscribers do not inadvertently burst through their upper data limits and incur a large overcharge on their monthly bills. This requires the ability to define thresholds of data usage for alerts based upon live customer activity. Responsive to these thresholds notification triggers are provided to carrier messaging systems enabling further action by the subscribers to interact with the carrier to respond to their respective data usage position. Thus subscriber data usage is monitored at step and when various notification levels are reached as determined at inquiry step a notification is provided to the carrier messaging system at step . The carrier generates messages to the customer at step enabling a customer response at step . Customer responses may range from upgrading their plan blocking further data usage shifting remaining data to shared devices or instantly adding data amounts to their device etc. If no notification is needed at step the system continues monitoring data usage at step . This is particularly important so that carriers remain in compliance with regulatory mandates on overage charges for customer satisfaction and to maintain brand reputation.

Referring now to the system is also useful in providing services to various high value subscribers. In order to bridge the current chasm between OSS and BSS toolsets carriers can identify high value subscribers HVS in real time and set policies and rules for a variety of conditions and actions. These policies can be adjusted in real time based upon the HVS score and controlled by customer care network operations marketing promotions etc. Examples of granularity include the ability to set automatic actions for subscribers with certain HVS levels and manual actions via dashboard for subscribers with other HVS scores. Thus the system would monitor data usage at step and determine the high value subscribers at in real time. Policies are established for the high value subscribers at step and the data associated with the subscriber monitored at step responses based upon the HVS status are generated at step . Examples of particular types of services which could be provided to HVS users include HVS users that are determined to be victims of fraud or phishing can receive an SMS message if they are identified as a victim of an inbound fraud or phishing attempt. With respect to network quality of service the HVS will be flagged if they have x number of dropped or silent or incomplete calls which are detected by the System as they occur and are mapped against each HVS. The HVS can automatically receive an SMS with an apology and an offer of credit toward next month s bill. Based upon network voice and data usage patterns of the HVS the carrier can choose to offer completely customized tariff plans. All You Can App offers include the option of paying per month for unlimited access to certain frequently used applications with the data usage not counted against the data limits of the subscriber s base plan. This sort of offer must be calculated and maintained in real time with live network traffic as the billing system and the customer s real time usage must be kept in sync.

Referring now to there is illustrated the manner in which the real time data monitoring system may be used to provide network outage notifications. As carriers upgrade network infrastructure to 4G LTE cell towers and sites must periodically be brought down for planned maintenance. Additionally unplanned outages occur with regularity. Carriers must be able to notify subscribers of these outages. The system can utilize contextual big data to model the cell site s subscribers spend the majority of their time in and automatically push SMS message notifications when there is a planned outage. In the case of an unplanned outage or an outage that will affect subscribers that are not usually in that cell site but are headed toward it the system can identify which subscribers will soon be approaching a degraded service area and send an SMS message to anyone who is signed up for just in time notifications.

Simultaneously the planned cell tower outage schedules act as event triggers and manual updates and changes to these schedules are ingested by the ingest VM . These are integrated at and sent onwards to the network topology bitmap . The network topology bitmap represents a live data mirror of device locations the cell tower locations or planned or dynamically required outages for service improvements of those towers as well as accessing a historical record of the presence of the device locations within the targeted cell tower locations. This historical record allows for a deductive process to occur as to the multiple locations over a period of time with regard to both individual devices as well as multiple cell towers. In this fashion outage notifications can be based on both real time immediately occurring or historically based device presence in each cell tower location.

The role of the semantic node is shown in . The semantic node deductive processes and access the network topology bitmap and compare cell tower outage trigger dates with regard to the need for an action. Should action be required process deduces the current and historic presence relationship of mobile devices to the triggered cell tower address and accesses prescribed notification content data . Step builds the required notification and embeds any prescribed or dynamically available additional information based on customer status carrier events or sentiment analysis feedback. Step sends the completed message to the carrier notification gateway for transmission to the selected mobile device s or other communication endpoints and additionally sends notification metrics for live data display . Step sends a copy of the notification output to a journal for later analysis.

The ability for the system to provide real time sentiment analysis to the carrier is illustrated in . Step retrieves sent notification information and compares with feedback messages from carrier message hub. Step compares sentiment feedback with regard to keywords timeliness of response to outage notification redemption of included coupons use of curse words and other embedded criteria used to measure subscriber sentiment. Such information is compiled into a live data report at and additionally readied for transmission at to display as live data sentiment analysis with regard to the impact of the outage. Such live data sentiment analysis provides time and opportunity for the carrier to respond in kind to the sentiment reporting.

A further example of the use of the real time data monitoring system is with respect to network core instrumentation and alerting. Examples of this include the ability to monitor measure and alert on any network operation or function with the option to set configurable parameters for threshold limits alarms and performance optimums. In all cases visualizations and queries can be drilled down to show innumerable combinations of data e.g. calls by time country circuit partner device etc. and time periods real time immediate performance and drill down to show how immediate conditions compare against any desired time period of minutes hours days weeks months etc. . In all cases thresholds or performance norms can be set or changed in real time by the customer and any deviation or desired alerting alarming can be sent to a variety of destinations including dashboards email mobile devices or other applications solutions or systems.

The system can measure the performance of network circuits CICs in real time and provide visualization of all monitored CICs over a selectable time period to show trends and performance norms. When any single CIC or group of fellow CICs fall below the threshold which are configurable and changeable in real time from the dashboard alerts can be sent to the dashboard and or to email SMS or other connected systems.

Measurements of total network traffic can be as granular as the customer desires. Measurements can include total calls in out total SMS in out and any combination of drill down on these analyses including querying the data by circuit by cell tower by interconnected partner by inbound or outbound traffic by destination or origin country by device type by conversation length etc. Anything that can be measured can be queried and displayed on the dashboard.

The system may be used to measure the ratio of answered to unanswered calls against a customer configured threshold. Real time data can be drilled down by any of the categories mentioned in the previous use case and thresholds can be changed in real time. Alerts can be sent to a dashboard email SMS or other system. This system may also detect average conversation times and interconnect traffic data and provide alerts reports etc. based upon this information. Thus using the above described system and method real time data flow within a network via a connection to a particular network element switch etc. may be achieved in order to analyze the real time data flow in order to generate analysis and reports of the data while the data is actively being generated before it exits the network for onward storage. This enables network providers to provide much more up to date and real time responses to the analyzed data and achieve improvements to system performance and issues as these events are occurring rather than at a later date based upon post data analysis.

The system described herein above may be used in a number of different applications using the ingestor nodes and semantic nodes. In one example mobile devices are used in many parts of the world not merely as communication and information devices but also to carry out financial transactions between parties. The mobile device carrier may provide financial transaction services very similar to those provided by a bank. There are several types and channels of mobile money transfer fraud that illustrate the need for a system such as that described herein to monitor for and detect fraud. Some examples are illustrated in . It will be appreciated that the examples of fraud described herein below are only some examples of the types of fraud that the described system is useful for intercepting and correcting. Referring now to two examples include fraud perpetrated by the mobile carrier agents and customer care center personnel and so called socially engineered fraud. There are four primary impacts of the system . Firstly to reduce the reliance on agents for identification verification. In this particular embodiment for mobile carriers relying on agents and customer care centers to verify identify and intent for issuing new or replacement SIM cards mobile devices or PIN codes. Second to continuously audit inspect and verify all or targeted network usage until verification hurdles have been met and released. In this particular embodiment for mobile carriers to inspect the usage of all newly issued or replaced SIM cards PIN codes or mobile devices for potential socially engineered or other fraud in mobile money transfers or mobile messaging as they occur. Third to inspect all mobile money transfers for potential socially engineered or other types of fraud as they occur. And finally the ability to intercept the fraudulent transaction before it completes when identified in the second and third cases above.

Fraud of various types may enter into the system through either of the agent or individuals working at the customer care center . The agent and customer care center perform a number of functions for the mobile carrier. The agent is an individual responsible for selling mobile devices SIM cards and other components necessary for the user to connect with a mobile network. Customer care interacts with agent when a new user is requested added validating the information provided and authorizing device account provisioning in some cases. Customer care center also provides help services to the user once a user has established an account with a mobile carrier.

As shown in the agent customer care center personnel perform functions such as selling SIM cards or devices and handling activation of new accounts. Examples of agent activities include the submission of user information to customer care carrier in order to facilitate the opening of a new customer account. This process will initiate the provisioning and activation of a mobile device onto the carrier mobile network. The agents can additionally request provisioning and activation of a new SIM card or mobile device for an existing user if a mobile device is lost or stolen. Another example of agent provided services include the setting or resetting of user PINs . These user PINs are used for authorizing mobile money transfers by a user.

These processes present a number of opportunities for fraud involving both the agent and customer care center . Examples include the request of a new SIM or device on the account of a customer who will be away for a long period of time example traveling abroad. With the customer absent the issued SIM or mobile device may be used by an unauthorized party for an extended period of time since the customer will be unaware of the fraudulent use until their return. Another example involves the agent selling customers phony mobile wallet applications where the deposited funds would go to the agent or fraudster rather than the genuine mobile provider. Another fraud example involves misleading users to believe that PIN numbers must be shared for customer service reasons . The disclosed PIN number may then be used for nefarious purposes. Agents or customer care representatives can also perform fake account activations . The fake account is opened using false user information. Similarly fraudulent devices may be activated on an existing account . In this case an actual account is utilized but a device not authorized by the customer is activated on the account.

A result of any of these fraudulent situations may not become known to the original legitimate user until days or weeks later. The system described herein above may solve this issue by reducing carrier reliance on agents and customer care center personnel as the verifiers of customer identity and intent. This enables mobile carriers to monitor the provisioning process and use of devices based on rules and policies that are not controlled by the agents or customer care representatives providing a solution to the challenge of quis custodiet ipsos custode who will guard the guards themselves .

Referring now to socially engineered fraud is a low tech method of fraud that relies on human interaction to break normal security protocols. There are several examples of socially engineered fraud including scams phishing threats and other methods. A mistaken deposit scam occurs when a victim receives a message that the sender has mistakenly sent a sum of money meant for someone else. As a thank you for returning the money the victim is offered an opportunity to keep some of the money. The original mistaken deposit was never actually made in the first place and the victim has lost the returned money. In a false job application scam a victim is invited to apply for a job but must pay an application fee. There is actually no job and the fraudster can scam hundreds of victims in a very short period of time. In a threats or coercion fraud a victim receives a message that a family member is being threatened or held hostage and will only be released if a certain sum of money is transferred or receives other similar threats designed to extract a payment.

In most of these situations the victim will willingly and unsuspectingly except in the case of threats initiate or respond to a mobile money transfer request and complete the transfer of money to the fraudster. The victim does not become aware of the fraud until afterwards sometimes long afterwards and may not immediately be aware that they have been victimized. The system described herein above may be used to enable mobile carriers to identify interact with and track the integrity of the transaction while the sender and recipient are engaged in the social interaction related to the mobile money transfer. The mobile carrier may thus apply a probable cause to doubt model of assurance while the transaction is underway and before it is completed.

Referring now to there is illustrated the general topology of a mobile payment verification system MPTV described herein above as applied to the mobile money transfer application and fraud situations that have been described. The MPTV system is a system providing for the continuous observation simultaneous audit and pre verification of user activities as they occur within a mobile network using a system such as the network real time data analysis system described herein above. The MPTV system is implemented in parallel with a mobile carrier network using an ingestor node as described above. The MPTV system uses the network provider s SMS service or another suitable messaging or communications service. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that while the present disclosure references the use of the SMS service that any messaging service application or communications capability can be utilized where SMS is referenced herein. The MPTV system introduces a machine driven socially interactive increased assurance of intent layer in parallel to and interactively with mobile money transfers. The MPTV system interacts with several subcomponents of a mobile carrier network and mobile money transfer service including the mobile network through ingestor node the financial service layer through financial system API application program interface and the provisioning process through ingestor .

The MPTV system performs several significant functions. The MPTV system reduces the reliance of mobile carriers on agents and customer care centers as the sole identifier of intent and or as adjudicators of new or replacement SIM cards devices and PIN issuances as the MPTV system provides an automated ability to check and record the decision making process for issuing or replacing SIM cards devices or PINs. Second the MPTV system provides the ability to continuously track the actions and usage of any target devices PINs SIMs or users. And third the MPTV system monitors network use for potential socially engineered fraud in mobile money transfers or SMS messaging as they occur. The system can intercept fraudulent transfers or transactions as they occur. Any one of these MPTV activities has the ability to trigger subsequent alerts recordkeeping and external notifications for remedial action while a transaction is in process. Thus the system adjusts the outcome of the transaction to a more desirable result before its completion.

In addition to the live carrier network inputs the MPTV system is able to dynamically receive fraud use case updates from multiple big data trending analysis pools. This information enables the MPTV system to incorporate fraud trends as part of its detection scenarios. Additionally the MPTV system dynamically incorporates live updates via SMS from both the sender or the recipient as to whether the transaction was completed as expected. The MPTV system updates and integrates with the MPTV system self learning capability to enhance the detection algorithms and assist in the continuous and automatic improvement of fraud detection as it happens. Both capabilities are assistive for investigative forensic efforts in addition to the live data interceptive detection and arrest.

The MPTV system architecture uses the network real time data analysis system described herein above in the following manner. Ingestor node s connect to key points within the provisioning process and mobile network to gather and return data. Semantic node houses the mobile money transfer fraud detection software that analyzes the data in accord with its assigned policy or contextualization returns verification criteria to the ingestor nodes for onward interaction with the carrier system and manages the API that connects the MPTV system to the carrier s mobile money transfer financial system .

The full extent of the MPTV system requires interactive ingestor node access to carrier retail internet networks and customer care communication system . A network element example MSC gateway etc. identifies mobile messaging or mobile payment transactions in progress. The MPTV system accesses the carrier financial system through the API as a duly authorized administering agent. The ingestor nodes connect to the MPTV application implemented at the semantic node .

Each of these components form the virtual machine providing automated message based interactive test and verification of a mobile network user identity and intent for the provisioning of new or replacement PINs SIM cards or mobile devices and in parallel to their network usage conduct such test and verification for fraudulent mobile money transfers or other deemed activities including the ability to test and alert for ongoing socially engineered fraud threats or scams.

The MPTV system provides mobile carriers with a new approach and a new level of sophistication in tracking the fidelity of activity occurring in mobile networks . This level of continuous observation and continuous audit is not restricted to mobile money transfers or PIN verification. Other uses may be applied pertaining to all manner of content transfer trap and trace of socially engineered scams network security hacking privacy or operational fidelity. Nor is it restricted to mobile networks the MPTV system can be targeted towards other networks and events requiring pre verification including but not limited to enterprise networks sensors M2M and others.

The MPTV system is well suited to providing a new approach to security for the requirements of network function virtualization hybrid and increasingly virtualized networks and the requirement of generating network elements on demand. The MPTV system does not compete with legacy or other security and fraud detection methodologies but adds a new detection and interception paradigm in keeping with the move to mobility and virtualization with its need for on demand change or scale.

When applied to mobile money transfers this new level of interactive pre verification of the transaction before funds are actually transferred also lessens if not removes the fiduciary responsibility of the mobile carrier to reimburse users for the majority or any part of fraudulent transactions as the authorization involves the user himself. The process also provides an immediate audit trail of events before and during the transaction that can be played forward to engage trap and trace of future related activities. For mobile carriers the three greatest assets are the network subscribers and the brand. The MPTV system increases the operational fidelity of each of these three assets.

The user is assured within the MPTV system that policing of transactions is undertaken during the actual transaction itself with the capability to stop nefarious and fraudulent transfers. This offers a new and higher level of security and a new and higher level of assurance and protection from victimization through socially engineered fraud and other fraud types.

The MPTV system uses the semantic node to provide the mobile carrier with live observation and audit processing statistics including but not limited to number of SMS messages being processed number of fraud events detected intercepted prevented by location type and date time new detection types alerts on suspicious activity view of current social dialogue keywords and trends individual or group transaction drilldowns all PINs or SIMs under surveillance all mobile money transfers currently in dialogue all transactions related to a particular subscriber any subscriber engaged in X dialogues and social webs. These types of statistics are variable and live and can identify patterns of fraud and perpetrators as they occur as they are generated from the live traffic. The MPTV system allows the mobile carrier to start and stop the system and to extract certain operational performance statistics for problem diagnosis. New algorithms can be introduced while the MPTV system is operational without the need to pause or take the system off line to push out these updates.

Referring now to there is illustrated a general flow diagram of the manner in which the MPTV system can monitor for fraudulent monetary transactions over a mobile carrier network. An ingestor node ingests data from agents and customer care sources at step as described hereinabove. In parallel an ingestor node ingests data from network traffic at step . The MPTV system interfaces at step with the carrier financial system through the API . The semantic node analyzes carrier traffic at step and correlates a common view of all ingested data from and to detect socially engineered fraud or other fraudulent transactions. Using the MPTV system architecture steps and may be used for outward facing customer interaction while step may access machine driven contextual verification algorithms and transaction management to provide the software defined interactive command and control security checkpoints for increased ID verification when provisioning users and includes an option for PIN issue tracking and to verify mobile money transfers.

Referring now to the step of ingesting data from a data carrier provisioning process at an ingestor to reduce reliance on agents customer care centers when determining validity of new or replacement SIM cards PINs or mobile devices is more particularly described. The node monitors for new or replacement provisioning of SIM cards PINs or mobile devices. Ingestor node observes traffic at key aggregation points of a carrier s Intranet between retail agents and the customer care center . Ingestor node provides bidirectional monitoring and mirrors data passing through the point as described herein above for observing requests for provisioning of SIM cards PINs or mobile devices. The ingestor node also has output connectivity to the customer care process retail agents and provisioning process to facilitate notifications to those functions.

Using the ingestor node the MPTV system at semantic node connects to and interacts with the provisioning request process at step between a carrier agent and the customer care center personnel . Ingestor node injects at step subsequent system deduced verification criteria that provides the ability to reduce the reliance on retail agents and customer care center personnel as the primary or only authority to qualify the validity of identity for the issuance of a new or replacement SIM card PIN or mobile device. Using the data gathered from ingestor node the semantic node generates at step dynamic time sensitive questions to verify a user s identity. Since this information can remain in the closed loop MPTV system deduced environment the agent or customer care center personnel cannot access or influence it. The reissuance of a forgotten PIN or the replacement of a supposedly stolen device can be restricted until the user correctly answers a series of dynamically generated personalized questions based on their own network activity.

When the issuance or reissuance has successfully passed these hurdles the system enables the continuous audit and supervised usage of all newly issued or reissued SIM cards PIN numbers or mobile devices to further ensure non fraudulent usage. This is achieved by placing all these issue reissue activities on a suspected hot list until certain dynamic verification hurdles have been passed.

Ingestor node notifies the MPTV system at semantic node of the issuance of any new or replacement PINs SIM cards or mobile devices at step . This notification can also be programmatically prescribed only those situations meeting certain criteria for example . This notification updates the MPTV system at the semantic node plausible hot list and forwards the hot list to all ingestor nodes monitoring the mobile network and to the nodes associated with the financial system to observe and report all activity as suspect until released. When identified ingestor node interacts with the MPTV system at the semantic node to engage MPTV machine driven socially interactive contextual verification algorithms. As an example a carrier may choose to designate all reset re issued PINs as suspect until the device has been used for 48 hours with no complaints or reports that the PIN was fraudulently reset. They may decide to designate as suspect only those users with reissued PINs who have been customers for 6 months or less. MPTV system monitors all relevant and target activity by those users for the prescribed time period and can require the user to confirm each mobile payment transaction via the socially interactive verification questions until they have reached a certain proof hurdle . Then the user is released from the suspect hot list.

Referring now to there is more particularly illustrated the software flow associated with ingestor node for detection and identification of new replacement PINs SIM cards or mobile devices for the continuous audit and verification process. The ingestor node provides a continuous ingestion at step of the traffic between the agent customer care center and provisioning process . Inquiry step determines whether a new or replacement PIN SIM card or mobile device provisioning process has been detected. If not the data is ignored at step and returns to inquiry step for a next group of data. If inquiry step identifies a new or replacement provisioning process information is unpacked from the content of the data at step and placed into a memory of the ingestor node . The data may comprise information such as identification of the agent the sender and recipient IDs location of the transaction amount of the transaction etc. Next inquiry step checks for known fraudulent numbers in fraudulent scenarios from a hot list stored locally at the ingestor node . This information is provided from the packet sniper in memory data of known fraud scenarios and hot list information provided from the semantic node . When a known fraud number or scenario is detected a flag is set for a suspected known issue at step and an alert status is sent to the semantic node . Examples of actions that can be triggered by this flag include intercepting actions by this user or setting higher validation hurdles . If no known fraud number or scenario is detected at inquiry step a flag is set at step to generate an inquiry for provisioning of the new PIN SIM card or mobile device. The agent and customer contact care addresses are set at step to enable the SMS communications to confirm the transaction. The unpacked data and alert status are sent at step to the semantic node for MPTV system processing and generation of the appropriate questions.

Referring now to there is described the operation of the ingestor node associated with a mobile carrier network as referenced in step of . Ingestor node monitors all activity as it occurs including that of newly issued or replaced PINs SIM cards mobile devices usage and mobile money transfers. The ingestor node notifies the semantic node at step of the issuance of new or replacement SIMs PINs mobile devices or any mobile money transfer activity. The semantic node tags and tracks at step all activity and usage that is detected by ingestor nodes against a set of rules and targets. When a particular transaction or situation is detected at step an alert is generated at step and this information is transmitted to the MPTV system at the semantic node .

A particular example of this is illustrated with respect to . The MPTV system can treat all activity on newly issued or replacement PINs as suspect until that PIN or device is proven to be bona fide after a predetermined number of transactions or is released as bona fide through mobile carrier senior official recorded override. Using ingestor node all newly issued PINs are identified at step . When a newly issued PIN is identified an alert is generated and sent along with packet information associated with the PIN to the MPTV system semantic node . This information is unpacked and stored at step within an MPTV system hot list at the semantic node for verification. Additionally the MPTV system redistributes at step such summarized information to other ingestor nodes to identify further usage elsewhere. The hot list listing is maintained for a predetermined and or dynamic period of time and provides a period of supervised usage for the PIN or mobile number to protect the user from stolen PINs or devices. The hot list becomes a trigger for intercept and verification regardless of the activity involved. As an example a carrier may choose to designate all reset re issued PINs as suspect until the device has been used for 48 hours with no complaints or reports that the PIN was fraudulently reset. They may decide to designate as suspect only those users with reissued PINs who have been customers for 6 months or less.

Referring now to there is illustrated a more detailed flow diagram of the operation of the ingestor flow software of ingestor node that monitors for usage of new or replacement PINs SIM cards or mobile devices. Ingestor node continuously ingests at step the network traffic for SMS or other forms of PIN SIM card or mobile device access. Inquiry step determines if the detected information relates to new or replacement SIM card PIN mobile device or money transfer. If not the process is ignored at step and returns to inquiry step . If inquiry step determines that the data does relate to one of these items information associated with the data is unpacked and stored in a memory of the ingestor node at step . This information may comprise the agent identity sender and recipient IDs locations amount of transfer etc. Next at step a determination is made if the detected information is associated with known fraud numbers or scenarios based upon a hot list at the ingestor node . The information within the hot list is provided from the packet sniper and in memory data of known fraud scenarios . If a fraud number or fraud scenarios are detected at step a flag is set indicating a suspected known issue and an alert status is sent at step . If inquiry step detects no known number or scenario within the hot list a function flag is set at step that identifies the PIN SIM card mobile device or money transfer operation as a hot list item. The user contact address is checked at step for the user associated with the data to enable a verification dialogue with the user. The unpacked data and alert status are transmitted at step to the semantic node for MPTV system processing.

Referring now to there is illustrated the system capability to continuously audit all mobile money transfers for indications of socially engineered and other types of fraud as it occurs and to intercept it before the transaction completes. In the case of a mobile money transfer the MPTV system connects to and interacts in parallel alignment with the carrier network traffic at step using ingestor node . This enables the ingestor node to monitor messaging undertaken between network users that indicates socially engineered or other forms of fraud is occurring. The ingestor node inspects all traffic for mobile money transfer protocols or communications such as SMS messaging to identify such mobile money transfers forms hot listed newly issued or suspected PINS. It can also deduce fraudulent payment situations using keywords or comparative situations such as location or frequency with regard to mobile money transfers or other prescribed indicators of fraud at step . In this regard there is an option to turn on inspection by the ingestor nodes of all messaging for keywords indicating situations suggestive of phishing fraud or other threatening interactions. When the semantic node positively identifies such interactions at step the ingestor nodes within the system are updated with specific text and keywords to provide continual updating for the contextual self learning process.

The API to the financial system is a bidirectional API that enables step of to interact with the carrier mobile money transfer financial system to send instructions and commands and to receive messages. The API interface acts as a virtual administrator to the financial services system for authorization commands from the semantic node these can be diverted to a human administrator if desired . The authorization commands may comprise commands such as to place a hold on the account place release on fund transfer send fund transfer request PIN change generate soft PIN or automatically generated PIN. In sending the request through the API the processes carried out in step update their own files to indicate that interactions on this request have been completed.

Referring now to there is more particularly illustrated the functional structure of the MPTV system within the semantic node for performing the analysis of the carrier traffic monitored by the ingestor nodes and . The semantic node provides machine driven contextual verification algorithms and transaction management. The semantic node houses the software defined MPTV application that provides the deductive identity verification and interactive social conversation logic for verifying a transaction. The MPTV system semantic node consists of six primary functions. Three of these functions are provided to the MPTV system through the applications framework described herein above with respect to . The remaining three functions are unique to the MPTV system .

The three common functions include the alert and visualization functions for generating system alerts. The system command and control administration functions provide for command and control of system functions of the MPTV system . The ingestor grid communications function enables communication between the semantic node and the various ingestor nodes and that the semantic node may be in communication with. It should be realized that while only a single ingestor node monitoring the mobile carrier services a single ingestor node monitoring communications between agents provisioning processes and the customer care center and a single semantic node have been illustrated with respect to multiple such nodes may be utilized.

The three functions that are unique to the MPTV system are driven by data received from the ingestor nodes and . These functions include a transaction management and work area function interactive undertaking of stored and contextually driven dialogue functions and communication for inbound and outbound data update and contextual learning functions . The verification data is factual and empirical and is customized by the MPTV system to the individual user. In customization the data is continuously updated by MPTV system as background tasks to MPTV s primary task of verification of intent. The carrier is able to set hurdles metrics to be achieved that allow the MPTV system to approve or not approve a mobile provisioning or mobile money transfer situation. If not approved or if recommended not to proceed in a provisioning situation the MPTV system sends an alert to the retail agent the customer care representative and the carrier provisioning system. If not approved or if recommended not to proceed with a mobile money transfer situation MPTV system informs the sender and recipient of such a non approval and sends an alert and recommendation not to proceed to the mobile carrier financial system. In this manner the transaction can be stopped but in any regard it is recorded as suspect and tagged for future reference. If the transaction is approved the MPTV system releases the transaction or situation from hold status and informs the carrier customer care center retail agent or financial system that the transaction is completed.

Thus the MPTV system semantic node takes inputs from ingestor nodes and and interfaces connections to other communication systems such as SMS or email services. It provides a contextual verification dialogue with both the sender and the recipient of a transaction or event in order to substitute a machine interpreted validity and intent of the transaction or message. This dialogue occurs while the mobile money transfer transaction is underway and before the MPTV system determines whether to allow the transaction to occur. The generation of this dialogue is strengthened in parallel by all the inputs of external big data pools or other information sources such as HLR HSS interfaces based on the prescribed and dynamic preset level of verification required by the mobile carrier and or as the automated MPTV system engages in the process of self learning. As the MPTV system in semantic node has the capability to manually or dynamically update its parameters based both on actual events as they occur and on trending information from big data pools these parameters and the resulting dialogue is continuously updated.

The operations of the transaction management work area functions are more fully illustrated with respect to the flow diagram of . Using the semantic node time dependent buffer capture area the MPTV system discretizes at step the incoming data from the ingestor nodes and and the API . The semantic node assesses the nature of the intercept of the incoming traffic with regard to the required action. Examples of actions include but are not limited to a new or replacement PIN SIM card or mobile device ID verification b ID verification of in use PIN SIM card or mobile devices on a watch list c mobile money transfer d suspected SMS threats or scams or e other related carrier selected ingestor node snipe criteria or requested data such as that provided by network elements example by HLR HSS or RAN interfaces or virtual private networks VPNs .

After identifying the need at step the data is moved out of the time dependent buffers of the semantic node into the discrete memory areas made available for the independent parallel processes covering the verification actions above and others at step . The identification of one of these verification cases triggers a transaction alert at step to the carrier s financial system and a hold is placed at step on any of the current or future transactions related to the item until cleared by the MPTV system . The hold lasts for a configurable time period and serves as a timeout delay pending no resolution of identity intent or verification. Thus inquiry step determines if the hold is expired and if not maintains a hold at step . Once the hold period expires the hold is released at step and a notification is sent. The verification actions have the ability to timeout and default to approved or not approved in which case the work areas are released and the notification is sent of a timed out default status result.

Referring now to there is illustrated a flow chart describing the operation of the interactive undertaking of stored and contextually driven verification dialogue functions . Verification processes and dialogue are independently organized and aligned with the verification actions as described here and above with respect to . Each process is multithreaded and able to function in parallel to each other. Each process contains its own dialogue and data pertinent to its use case. Each process is also able to access a central file for commonly used data that may be internal or external to the MPTV system .

Upon determining that the use case in question is a pending mobile money transfer transaction at step the MPTV system opens at step an in memory temporary financial transaction account file as an application workspace and record. This file is used to store transactional message information and is used as a temporary work area so that no interaction or data is lost. This temporary work area is released on completion of the verification process or can be moved to a longer term storage as an audit trail. Simultaneously the MPTV system sends a hold message at step to the financial authorization or transaction processing system. The MPTV system notifies the financial system of the status of the social verification and the hold is either removed if verification is approved and the transaction continues or can be substantiated as declined if the social verification for PIN or money mobile transfer fails.

Using the work area the MPTV system commences communication with the sender and or recipient of the transaction by messages via SMS or using other registered communication methods. The system runs through a prescribed dynamically changeable dialogue of questions with specific prescribed answers at step . A standard list of questions is precompiled and updated regularly as a matter of process using master files. These questions have been prescribed as a general set of questions and are customized on an individual basis with answers and ongoing questions that are personal only to the pre verified sources the sender and or receiver .

These questions can be specifically generated and selected based upon the keywords and dialogue between sender and receiver and the contextual information generated by the precious responses the sender receiver account information and network inputs as well as other dynamically generated inputs.

Examples of specific questions and inputs based on the fraud use cases introduced in this document hereinabove including but not limited to 

Responses are received which lead to the next set of questions and answers until exhausted. An approved verification hurdle such as 60 or 100 of questions answered correctly must be reached. This hurdle can be adjusted manually or dynamically by the system. Thus inquiry step determines if the verification has been successful. When the dialogue is approved a release message is sent at step to the transaction vehicle where the event was previously notified to be placed on hold. If the dialogue is not approved an alert is sent to the carrier s fraud detection and security authority at step of a possible fraud or nefarious activity occurrence.

The approvals and non approvals are recorded for subsequent forensic reporting at step and MPTV system update. Non approved events or transactions are updated to the ingestor hot list file for immediate and continuing trap and trace and to provide alerts when appearing on the carrier s network for any reason. Mobile devices SIM cards PINs or phone numbers are automatically removed from the suspect hot list after a number of approved transactions or events. This hurdle for automatic removal from the suspect watchlist can be adjusted manually or dynamically.

An alternative option is for the MPTV system to interact with the financial system and issue soft token PINs per transaction or for certain time periods to newly issued or replacement PIN holder s accounts. This will cause the financial institution to reject any transaction that occurs unless approved as to the fidelity or identity of the user and the transaction intent.

Referring now back to the ingestor grid communications function controls communication for inbound and outbound data updates and contextual learning that are both active and passive. The MPTV system semantic node has active bidirectional communications capability supplying the time dependent buffers with a constant input of targeted snipe packets for processing and on demand requests for situational data pertinent to the current verification processes in progress for example interactive verification dialogue . These requests also have access to ingestors attached to relevant network elements.

The MPTV system ability to interface to outside big data pools is passive and runs as a background task. This background task regularly verifies the system s internal event driven or empirical data for such metadata changes or trends from outside sources and updates its internal files. In this manner the MPTV system maintains and self updates files from ingestor driven experimental knowledge and from outside big data pool input for optimized relevancy. The operator or fraud security analyst commands the interface through passive drivers and can provide global changes or system administrative functions.

Referring now to there is illustrated a flow diagram for the operation of the semantic node responsive to input from ingestor connected to a mobile carrier network and ingestor node connected to the intranet provisioning process for provisioning new PINs or SIM cards or mobile devices. The semantic node includes multiple connections from ingestor nodes and and APIs at step . The semantic node receives and unpacks at step alert status as information is received from ingestor nodes and for processing by the MPTV system . The unpacked data is discretized at step into time dependent buffer memory as information such as sender and recipient IDs locations monetary amounts etc. Inquiry step determines whether the information has been received from an ingestor node connected to an intranet network between agents customer care centers and provisioning processes or an ingestor node connected to a mobile carrier network.

If inquiry step determines the data is from ingestor node the data is moved to ingestor node in memory storage area and released from the time dependent buffer at step . A request is sent to begin the verification process at step . If inquiry step determines the data is from ingestor node the data is moved to ingestor node in memory storage area and released from the time dependent buffer at step . Inquiry step determines whether the inquiry type comprises a monetary transfer. If not the request for a verification process is sent at step . If a monetary transfer request has been received a temporary file is opened at step for the monetary transfer and a request for a financial process is transmitted at step along with a hold on the money transfer until approval by the MPTV system .

Referring now to there is illustrated an example social verification process responsive to a received request . This is illustrative of the verification process parameters which include but are not limited to those shown in . Responsive to the received request the social verification process is initiated at step using stored procedures and assigned communications trails as discussed hereinabove. The verification procedures comprise a social Q A dialogue at step between the sender and the recipient using SMS or other media. Inquiry step determines if the request relates to any items stored on the system hot list. If so a fail alert is set at step . If the item is not on the hot list inquiry step determines if the item relates to any trending variances or anomalies indicating a problem with the verification request. If so the fail alert is set at step . If there are no variance or anomaly issues inquiry step checks for any date time or location anomalies. If any are detected a fail alert is set at step . Responsive to the setting of a fail alert at any of steps or the fail status is sent at step . If no anomalies or hot list items are detected in any of inquiry steps or a pass status is sent at step . If the sender recipient fail the interactive dialogue a pass fail status is sent at steps and .

Referring now to there is illustrated the semantic node post verification process responsive to the fail or pass status notification received from the social verification process discussed in . When a response is received from the verification process at step responsive to a request from ingestor node inquiry step determines whether the verification was failed or approved. If the request fails the requested action is not recommended at step and the ingestor and data files are updated with a fail status as are the customer care files at step . A fail response indication is sent to the prescribed recipients at step . If the verification process is approved the request is recommended at step and the ingestor node data files are updated with an approved status as are the customer care files at step . An approval request is sent to the prescribed recipients at step .

Referring now to a response to the verification process relating to an ingestor node is received at step . Inquiry step determines whether the verification request was failed or approved. Responsive to a failed request the request is not recommended at step and the temporary MPTV money transfer temporary account is closed and saved in the fail indication at step . The ingestor node data files are updated with a fail status as are the customer care and financial system files at step . A fail response is transmitted to the prescribed recipients at step and to the financial system at step . If the verification process has approved the request the recommended item is approved at step and the temporary MPTV money transfer temporary account is closed and a save indication of approval is recorded for the request at step . The ingestor node data files associated with the request are updated with an approved status as are the associated customer care and financial system files at step . An approved response is sent to the prescribed recipients at step and to the financial system at step .
