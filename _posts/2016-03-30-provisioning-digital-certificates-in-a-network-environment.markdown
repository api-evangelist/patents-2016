title: Provisioning digital certificates in a network environment
abstract: A method for provisioning digital certificates in a compute service environment may include authorizing a customer entity for using and/or controlling a network resource in the compute service environment. Upon completing the authorization, a digital certificate may be issued to the customer entity. The digital certificate may be associated with the network resource and may be issued for a limited duration period. The use and/or control of the network resource by the customer entity may be monitored. Reissuance of the digital certificate may be conditioned on whether the customer entity is still using and/or controlling the network resource in the compute service environment. If the customer entity is still using and/or controlling the network resource in the multi-tenant environment, the digital certificate may be automatically reissued for another limited duration period. The automatically reissuing may take place without receiving a certificate reissue request from the customer entity.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 189 262 filed Feb. 25 2014 entitled PROVISIONING DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IN A NETWORK ENVIRONMENT which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Cloud computing is the use of computing resources hardware and software that are available in a remote location and accessible over a network such as the Internet. In a computing environment with many computing devices such as a virtual server or cloud computing environment with many server computers the use of computing resources can provide a number of advantages including cost advantages and or the ability to adapt rapidly to changing computing resource needs. Additionally secure communications in the cloud computing environment are an important consideration as they ensure authentication of the communicating parties as well as integrity and security of the communication itself. However the setup of secure communications can be a difficult task for the communicating parties in the cloud computing environment.

For example entity authentication within the cloud computing environment may be based on digital certificates which may have to be issued to multiple parties. The digital certificates are typically issued by a Certificate Authority CA in exchange for a fee and after the CA has completed an extensive and time consuming authentication process. Once issued the digital certificates can be used without any additional interaction with or authentication by the CA which in the case of extended validation certificates can be a long period of time. Therefore not only is the process of obtaining digital certificates time consuming but issuing certificates for an extended period of time may lead to unauthorized use of the certificates causing security breaches in the cloud computing environment.

A virtual machine image contains an operating system e.g. Linux and other data needed to launch a virtual machine in a virtual environment. The virtual machine image is similar to a physical computer s disk volume and may include a file system the operating system and other components needed to boot up as a machine. In order to launch a virtual machine hardware needs to be selected. The hardware selection may be accomplished through instance types which may allow a variety of different sizes of memory CPU capacity I O performance and so forth. The combination of the virtual machine image and the instance type can be used to create an instance or a virtual machine which may be launched on a cloud computing resource such as a host server computer in a multi tenant network environment.

The following description is directed to techniques and solutions supporting provisioning of digital certificates in a network environment such as a cloud computing multi tenant network environment or another network environment e.g. a compute service provider environment with a compute service provider . A customer entity may request a digital certificate by communicating a Certificate Signing Request CSR to a Certificate Authority CA . The CA may perform identity and other verification of the requesting customer entity and information the customer entity is seeking to assert and get authorized by the CA e.g. the domain name of the customer entity identity of an officer of the customer entity requesting the certificate customer entity address authenticity of a public key of an asymmetric public private key pair of the customer entity and so forth . In this regard the CA may require proof of ownership of the domain and identity of the domain owner e.g. the customer entity as well as the identity of the corporate office or employee requesting the certificate. Once the CA has completed the authentication process the CA may issue a digital certificate associating the requesting customer entity with the public key. The digital certificate is also cryptographically signed by the issuing CA e.g. using a private key of the CA and can be traced through a hierarchy of CAs to a CA that is known and trusted. Typically a digital certificate has an expiration date at which point the customer entity may need to apply again and pay a fee for reissuing the certificate.

After issuance the digital certificate can be used in the cloud computing multi tenant network environment as well as other Internet based communications to establish the identity of the customer entity and or authenticity of one or more web sites or other network resources or services associated with the customer entity. Flexibility and reliability of digital certificate issuance and management may be improved by for example implementing the CA as part of the multi tenant network environment. Additionally digital certificates may be automatically provisioned as limited duration digital certificates that are associated with one or more network resources that are being used by the customer entity. In this regard the limited duration digital certificates may be automatically reissued to the customer entity as long as the customer entity is continuing to use pay for and or control at least one network resource e.g. a virtual machine a database a network related service and so forth within the cloud computing multi tenant network environment.

As used herein the term provisioning a digital certificate means enabling and providing a digital certificate related service to a customer which may include authorizing the customer to have a digital certificate issuing the digital certificate to the customer and managing the digital certificate after issuance e.g. renewing reissuing and or revoking the digital certificate .

The CA may comprise suitable circuitry logic and or code and may be implemented within the compute service provider to handle the issuance and management e.g. reissuance and or revocation of digital certificates. The network resources . . . may include one or more network resources associated with the compute service provider . For example the network resources . . . may include one or more of a virtual machine launched by the compute service provider on behalf of the customer entity e.g. the customer entity administered by the customer entity a database managed administered by the customer entity using a resource that runs the database and is managed by the provider and or another network related service e.g. load balancing that is provided and managed by the compute service provider . Even though CA is implemented as part of the computer service provider in other implementations the provider may use the services of a CA that is implemented separately from the provider as indicated by the dashed lines in .

The resource monitor may comprise suitable circuitry logic and or code and may be operable to monitor usage control of one or more of the network resources . . . by the customer entity via communication paths . For example the resource monitor may be operable to monitor whether the customer entity is paying for using and or controlling a network resource. As used herein the term controlling a network resource in reference to the customer entity may mean that the customer entity is the administrator of the network resource e.g. the network resources is launched using the customer entity s account with the provider and the customer entity is responsible for changing settings and other administrating functions with regard to the network resource . Using or controlling a network resource does not necessarily mean that the customer entity is paying for it. Also using the network resource does not necessarily mean that the customer entity is controlling the network resource.

The resource monitor may generate an indication which may include a used resource indication a paid for resource indication and or a controlled resource indication. The indication may be communicated to the CA . In an example embodiment the CA may condition the issuance of a digital certificate upon receipt of the indication from the resource monitor that the customer entity is using paying for and or controlling one or more of the network resources . . . . Once issued a digital certificate e.g. may be stored in the one or more network resources in the certificate store and or communicated to the customer entity . The digital certificate may then be communicated to a third party e.g. a browser for purposes of authenticating the customer entity with the third party .

In operation the customer entity may send authentication information e.g. a request for a digital certificate one or more public and or private keys domain information customer address information corporate officer information and other authentication information to the CA . The requested digital certificate may be associated with one or more network resources e.g. . . . that are being used paid for and or controlled by the customer entity . Several examples of issuing digital certificates in a cloud computing multi tenant network environment are discussed herein below.

The customer entity may be paying for and using e.g. renting a virtual machine provided by the compute service provider . In this case the virtual machine is run by the customer entity e.g. using an account of the customer entity with the provider . The CA may then issue the digital certificate to the customer entity associating the certificate with the specific virtual machine being rented by the customer entity i.e. the certificate is issued for and identifies the specific virtual machine . The name of the virtual machine or any other resource being paid for used and or controlled by the customer entity may be set and reflected on the certificate by the compute service provider . The certificate may be issued for a limited duration e.g. one or more days hours or minutes and its reissuance may be dependent upon the continued use renting of the virtual machine by the customer entity . Thus use of a resource or service of the compute service provider and a relationship between a customer entity and the resource or service can be sufficient to automatically reissue the digital certificate for continued use thereof. For example the relationship can be that the customer entity purchases use on behalf of another third party entity or the customer entity acts as an administrator of the resource or service. Reissuance can occur automatically through tracking the expiration date and ensuring reissuance prior to expiration.

In another instance the name of the virtual machine for purposes of issuing the digital certificate or any other resource being paid for used and or controlled by the customer entity may be selected by the customer entity . For example the customer entity may select a specific virtual machine and request a digital certificate issued for the selected machine. In this regard the name of the virtual machine for purposes of issuing the digital certificate is being selected by the customer by virtue of selecting which virtual machine the digital certificate will be associated with. After the CA authenticates the customer entity using the authentication information the CA may issue a digital certificate for a limited duration and its reissuance may be dependent upon the continued use renting of the virtual machine selected by the customer entity .

The customer entity may request a certificate from the CA for a resource other than the network resources . . . . For example the customer entity may be using a service administered by the provider e.g. load balancing . In this instance the CA may issue a short term certificate which may be associated with the resource identified by the customer entity. The reissuance of the certificate may be conditioned upon the customer continuing to pay for and use the service administered by the provider .

The customer entity may be using a network resource e.g. and may request a digital certificate from the CA . In this case the provider may issue the requested digital certificate for a limited duration and require that the customer entity not only pay for and use the network resource but also pay a separate fee for the issuance of the certificate for the limited duration. If the customer entity decides that the certificate is no longer needed e.g. at some point after issuance of the certificate and payment of the certificate fee for using the certificate for a limited duration period the provider may not renew reissue the certificate and the certificate will expire at the end of the limited duration period.

An action may comprise requesting by the customer entity a network resource. For example the customer entity may request to use one or more network resources selected from the available network resources . . . e.g. the customer entity may pay a fee and rent a virtual machine from the provider . Action may be performed by the provider and may include authorizing the customer entity for using and or controlling the requested network resource. The authorization process may include receiving desired settings for the network resource as well as payment of a fee for using controlling the resource.

Action may be performed by the customer entity and may include initiating the user and or control of the network resource authorized by the provider . Subsequent to the authorization action at the provider may also perform action by authorizing the customer entity for issuing a digital certificate. For example the customer entity may have requested e.g. at action a digital certificate to use with the network resource. In this regard the customer entity may also send the provider authentication information e.g. . At action and after the customer entity has been authorized for a digital certificate the CA may generate one or more public private keys which may be used for the digital certificate generation. In other instances the CA may use a public key of the customer entity which has been communicated to the CA with the authentication information the customer entity having possession of the private key .

At the CA may use the authentication information including the generated private public key pair to generate a digital certificate e.g. certificate for use by the customer entity in connection with the network resource that is being used controlled and or paid for by the customer entity . the digital certificate may be issued for a short fixed duration and may identify the specific network resource being used controlled and or paid for by the customer or another network resource that the customer needs certificate for . The generated certificate may be additionally signed by the CA e.g. by a private key of the CA to further authenticate the certificate. Regardless of which resource the certificate is issued for the continued use and renewal of the certificate may be dependent on the customer entity continuing to use control and or pay for a given network resource of the provider .

At the issued digital certificate e.g. may be returned to the customer entity and or stored with the network resource. At the customer entity may receive an acknowledgement of the issued digital certificate if certificate was stored at the network resource or may store the digital certificate e.g. at a local certificate store managed by the customer entity if the certificate was sent to the customer .

At the customer entity may stop using controlling and or paying for the requested network resource e.g. . At the resource monitor may detect the stoppage by the customer entity and may provide a stoppage indication to the CA . The CA may then not reissue renew the digital certificate upon its expiration action . As an alternative the customer entity may at continue using controlling and or paying for the network resource even after the previously issued short term digital certificate has expired. The resource monitor may send an indication notifying the CA of the continued use of the network resource and the CA may renew the digital certificate at .

Referring to there are illustrated actions that may be performed by the customer entity on the left side of the page and actions that may be performed by the compute service provider on the right side of the page in connection with provisioning digital certificates for a virtual machine. At the customer entity may pay for renting a virtual machine e.g. of the provider . At the provider may launch the virtual machine after the customer entity has been authorized for using the virtual machine settings of the virtual machine have been determined e.g. set by the customer and or the provider and payment from the customer has been received by the provider .

After the virtual machine is launched the provider may at authorize the customer entity for the issuance of a digital certificate associated with the virtual machine . At the CA may issue the digital certificate e.g. for a limited duration and associating the certificate to the virtual machine e.g. the certificate lists names the virtual machine in the certificate so that the customer entity may use the certificate in connection with providing services e.g. to consumers or any other services or functionalities using the virtual machine and requiring the use of a digital certificate. At the provider may store the issued digital certificate at the VM. At the customer entity may receive an acknowledgement of the issued digital certificate. At the CSP may allow the customer to use the digital certificate in connection with services launched on the virtual machine

Referring to there are illustrated actions that may be performed by the customer entity on the left side of the page and actions that may be performed by the compute service provider on the right side of the page in connection with provisioning digital certificates for a first network resource with the certificate renewal being dependent upon the customer entity using controlling and or paying for a second network resource. For example at the customer entity may pay for using and or controlling a plurality of network resources e.g. and of the provider . After authorizing the customer entity the provider may at provide the network resources and to the customer entity for using and or controlling.

At the customer entity may request a digital certificate to use in connection with the network resource . Authorization information e.g. may be sent to the CA and the CA may authorize at the customer entity for a digital certificate for use with network resource . At the CA may issue the digital certificate for a short duration and tying it to use and or control of the network resource by the customer entity . At the generated digital certificate e.g. is returned to the first network resource . At the customer entity may receive an acknowledgement of the issued digital certificate in connection with the network resource

At the customer entity may stop using controlling and or paying for the network resource . At the resource monitor may detect the stoppage by the customer entity and may provide a stoppage indication to the CA . The CA may then not reissue renew the digital certificate for the network resource upon its expiration action . As an alternative the customer entity may at continue using controlling and or paying for the second network resource even after the previously issued short term digital certificate for the first resource has expired. The resource monitor may send an indication notifying the CA of the continued use control of the second network resource and the CA may renew the digital certificate for the first resource at .

In an example embodiment the compute service provider can be established for an organization by or on behalf of the organization. That is the compute service provider may offer a private cloud environment. In another embodiment the compute service provider supports a multi tenant environment wherein a plurality of customers operate independently i.e. a public cloud environment . Generally speaking the compute service provider can provide the following models Infrastructure as a Service IaaS Platform as a Service PaaS and or Software as a Service SaaS . Other models can be provided. For the IaaS model the compute service provider can offer computers as physical or virtual machines and other resources. The virtual machines can be run as guests by a hypervisor as described further below. The PaaS model delivers a computing platform that can include an operating system programming language execution environment database and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on the compute service provider platform without the cost of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software. The SaaS model allows installation and operation of application software in the compute service provider. In some embodiments end users access the compute service provider using networked client devices such as desktop computers laptops tablets smartphones etc. running web browsers or other lightweight client applications. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the compute service provider can be described as a cloud environment.

The particular illustrated compute service provider includes a plurality of server computers A D. While only four server computers are shown any number can be used and large centers can include thousands of server computers. The server computers A D can provide computing resources for executing software instances A D. In one embodiment the instances A D are virtual machines. As known in the art a virtual machine is an instance of a software implementation of a machine i.e. a computer that executes applications like a physical machine. In the example each of the server computers A D can be configured to execute a hypervisor or another type of program configured to enable the execution of multiple instances on a single server. For example each of the servers A D can be configured e.g. via the hypervisor to support one or more virtual machine partitions with each virtual machine partition capable of running a virtual machine instance e.g. server computer A could be configured to support three virtual machine partitions each running a corresponding virtual machine instance . Additionally each of the instances can be configured to execute one or more applications.

In an example embodiment each of the server computers A D may also comprise a digital certificate store A D communicatively coupled to the network . The digital certificate store may comprise suitable circuitry logic and or code and may be operable to store one or more digital certificates that have been issued in connection with at least one instance running on a corresponding server computer .

The compute service provider may also comprise a digital certificate service . The digital certificate service may comprise suitable circuitry logic and or code and may be operable to monitor usage of network resources of the provider as well as issue renew and or revoke digital certificates in connection with one or more of the network resources e.g. instances and or other services associated with the server computers of the provider . In this regard the digital certificate service may implement one or more of the functionalities described herein that are performed by the resource monitor and or the CA in . Digital certificates that have been generated and managed by the digital certificate service may be communicated to a corresponding server computer that is associated with the network resource e.g. an instance the certificate is tied to. The digital certificate may then be stored locally by the digital certificate store of the corresponding server computer . As an alternative the generated digital certificate may also be stored by the digital certificate store associated with the managing server computer and communicated to the corresponding server computer as needed e.g. upon request by a client entity that is using controlling and or paying for an instance .

The digital certificate service may be implemented as a stand alone service within the provider as a dedicated server similar to the servers A D and or may be implemented as part of the server computer that performs management functions. For example the digital certificate service may be implemented as part of the management component as seen in .

It should be appreciated that although the embodiments disclosed herein are described primarily in the context of virtual machines other types of instances can be utilized with the concepts and technologies disclosed herein. For instance the technologies disclosed herein can be utilized with storage resources data communications resources and with other types of computing resources. The embodiments disclosed herein might also execute all or a portion of an application directly on a computer system without utilizing virtual machine instances.

One or more server computers can be reserved for executing software components for managing the operation of the server computers the instances the hypervisors and or the sensors . For example the server computer can execute a management component . A customer can access the management component to configure various aspects of the operation of the instances purchased by the customer. For example the customer can purchase rent or lease instances and make changes to the configuration of the instances. The customer can also specify settings regarding how the purchased instances are to be scaled in response to demand. The management component can further include a policy document to implement customer policies e.g. configuration policies as discussed in reference to .

The server computer may further comprise memory and a digital certificate store . The memory may be used as processing memory by one or more of the placement manager and or the components . . . . The digital certificate store may be used to store digital certificates as explained above as well as it may include one or more databases for storing and maintaining customer account information e.g. authorization information used to authorize use control of a network resource by a client entity and or authorization information used by the digital certificate service to authorize client entities for issuing digital certificates . The digital certificate store may be implemented as part of the placement manager and or any of the other components of the server computer e.g. as part of the management component .

An auto scaling component can scale the instances based upon rules defined by the customer. In one embodiment the auto scaling component allows a customer to specify scale up rules for use in determining when new instances should be instantiated and scale down rules for use in determining when existing instances should be terminated. The auto scaling component can consist of a number of subcomponents executing on different server computers or other computing devices. The auto scaling component can monitor available computing resources over an internal management network and modify resources available based on need.

A deployment component can be used to assist customers in the deployment of new instances of computing resources. The deployment component can have access to account information associated with the instances such as who is the owner of the account credit card information country of the owner etc. The deployment component can receive a configuration from a customer that includes data describing how new instances should be configured. For example the configuration can specify one or more applications to be installed in new instances provide scripts and or other types of code to be executed for configuring new instances provide cache logic specifying how an application cache should be prepared and other types of information. The deployment component can utilize the customer provided configuration and cache logic to configure prime and launch new instances . The configuration cache logic and other information may be specified by a customer using the management component or by providing this information directly to the deployment component . The instance manager can be considered part of the deployment component.

Customer account information can include any desired information associated with a customer of the multi tenant environment. For example the customer account information can include a unique identifier for a customer a customer address billing information licensing information customization parameters for launching instances scheduling information auto scaling parameters previous IP addresses used to access the account and so forth.

A network can be utilized to interconnect the server computers A D and the server computer . The network can be a local area network LAN and can be connected to a Wide Area Network WAN so that end users can access the compute service provider . It should be appreciated that the network topology illustrated in has been simplified and that many more networks and networking devices can be utilized to interconnect the various computing systems disclosed herein.

In order to access and utilize instances such as instances of a client device can be used. The client device can be any of a variety of computing devices mobile or otherwise including a cell phone smartphone handheld computer Personal Digital Assistant PDA desktop computer etc. The client device can communicate with the compute service provider through an end point which can be a DNS address designed to receive and process application programming interface API requests. In particular the end point can be a web server configured to expose an API. Using the API requests a client device can make requests to implement any of the functionality described herein e.g. request to authorize control usage and or payment for a network resource and or issuing a digital certificate in connection with one or more network resources . Other services which can be internal to the compute service provider can likewise make API requests to the end point . For example the client device may use the API requests to communicate a customer request for launching an instance and requesting a digital certificate associated with such instance.

Other general management services that may or may not be included in the compute service provider and or within the management component include an admission control e.g. one or more computers operating together as an admission control web service. The admission control can authenticate validate and unpack the API requests for service or storage of data within the compute service provider . The capacity tracker is responsible for determining how the servers need to be configured in order to meet the need for the different instance types by managing and configuring physical inventory in terms of forecasting provisioning and real time configuration and allocation of capacity. The capacity tracker maintains a pool of available inventory in a capacity pool database . The capacity tracker can also monitor capacity levels so as to know whether resources are readily available or limited.

An instance manager controls launching and termination of instances in the network. When an instruction is received such as through an API request to launch an instance the instance manager pulls resources from the capacity pool and launches the instance on a decided upon host server computer. Similar to the instance manager are the storage manager and the network resource manager . The storage manager relates to initiation and termination of storage volumes while the network resource manager relates to initiation and termination of routers switches subnets etc. A network of partitions is described further in relation to and includes a physical layer upon which the instances are launched.

The digital certificate service may communicate with the capacity tracker to receive information regarding available partitions and or host servers that can be used for launching an instance or other network resources requested by a client entity . Additionally communications with the admission control may be used to launch an instance and communications with the network of partitions may be used to push configuration changes as well as digital certificates onto hardware and or software resources of the host servers in order to effectuate functionalities described herein e.g. a digital certificate may be pushed to a corresponding server computer hosting the instance that is associated with the digital certificate and then stored at the digital certificate store at the corresponding server computer .

The router reads address information in a received packet and determines the packet s destination. If the router decides that a different data center contains a host server computer then the packet is forwarded to that data center. If the packet is addressed to a host in the data center then it is passed to a network address translator NAT that converts the packet s public IP address to a private IP address. The NAT also translates private addresses to public addresses that are bound outside of the data center . Additional routers can be coupled to the NAT to route packets to one or more racks of host server computers. Each rack can include a switch coupled to multiple host server computers. A particular host server computer is shown in an expanded view at .

Each host has underlying hardware including a network interface card NIC one or more CPUs e.g. processor memory e.g. memory a digital certificate store etc. The digital certificate store within the hardware layer may be used for storing one or more digital certificates e.g. associated with one or more of the partitions .

Running a layer above the hardware is a hypervisor or kernel layer . The hypervisor or kernel layer can be classified as a type 1 or type 2 hypervisor. A type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the host hardware to control the hardware and to manage the guest operating systems. A type 2 hypervisor runs within a conventional operating system environment. Thus in a type 2 environment the hypervisor can be a distinct layer running above the operating system and the operating system interacts with the system hardware. Different types of hypervisors include Xen based Hyper V ESXi ESX Linux etc. but other hypervisors can also be used.

A management layer can be part of the hypervisor or separated therefrom and generally includes device drivers needed for accessing the hardware . The partitions are logical units of isolation by the hypervisor. Each partition can be allocated its own portion of the hardware layer s memory CPU allocation storage etc. Additionally each partition can include a virtual machine its own guest operating system and its digital certificate e.g. associated with the virtual machine running on the corresponding partition . As such each partition is an abstract portion of capacity designed to support its own virtual machine independent of the other partitions.

In accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure a digital certificate service e.g. may be used to implement functionalities related to provisioning of digital certificates as described herein.

At the resource monitor may monitor the use and or control of the network resource e.g. by the customer entity . As used herein the term monitor and monitoring mean that the compute service provider may ping the management layer e.g. of the host server e.g. to determine if the VM is still active. If a response is received from the management layer it may include metadata associated with a customer account of the VM. Then the resource monitor may match the customer account associated with the digital certificate with the customer account of the VM. If they match then the resource monitor may determine that the VM is still active by the customer and an indication to that effect may be communicated to the CA as explained below in reference to step . The resource monitor may perform such monitoring at a predetermined duration of time prior to the expiration of the digital certificate issued to the customer entity using the VM.

At the reissuance of the digital certificate may be conditioned on whether the customer entity is still using and or controlling the network resource e.g. in the multi tenant environment. If the customer entity is still using and or controlling the network resource in the multi tenant environment the resource monitor may communicate an indication of such continued use to the CA and the CA may automatically reissue the digital certificate for another limited duration period. The automatic reissuing may takes place without receiving a certificate reissue request from the customer entity .

The authorizing may be in connection with a first network resource e.g. and the digital certificate may be automatically issued to the customer entity where the digital certificate may identify the first network resource e.g. and may be associated with usage of the first network resource by the customer entity .

In another instance the authorizing may be in connection with a first network resource e.g. and a second network resource e.g. . After the provider receives a request for issuing a digital certificate in connection with the second network resource the CA may automatically issuing the digital certificate in connection with the second network resource. The issuance of the digital certificate for the second network resource may be conditioned upon usage and or control of the first network resource by the customer entity . Reissuance of the digital certificate in connection with the second network resource may be conditioned on whether the customer entity is still in control of and or using the first network resource .

The digital certificate e.g. issued to the customer entity for the network resource may associate a public cryptographic key with the customer entity the public cryptographic key corresponding to a private cryptographic key. The private and public key pair may be generated by the CA . For example the CA may generate the public cryptographic key and the private cryptographic key upon authorizing the customer entity for usage and or control of the network resource in the multi tenant environment. The private cryptographic key may be managed by the CA and may be inaccessible to the customer entity . The network resource may include one or more of a virtual machine a database and or a service used controlled by and or paid for by the customer entity .

The CA may automatically reissue the digital certificate upon receiving an indication e.g. that the customer entity is still using the virtual machine and an indication that the customer entity is still requesting a digital certificate for the virtual machine. The digital certificate may also be automatically reissued by the CA upon receiving a payment from the customer entity for continued use of the virtual machine and for reissuing the digital certificate.

The authorizing of the customer entity may include receiving payment from the customer entity for using the virtual machine and for the issuance of the digital certificate. The virtual machine may be associated with a customer account of the customer entity within the multi tenant network environment of the provider .
