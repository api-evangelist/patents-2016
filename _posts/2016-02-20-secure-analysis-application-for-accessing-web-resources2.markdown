Embodiments described herein may be directed to systems methods apparatuses devices computer program products computer executable instructions and or applications for securely and anonymously accessing web resources and customizable attribution of identity. In accordance with the present disclosure a user may inspect and analyze a webpage as well as the underlying source code from an arm s length using a secure analysis application to prevent exposure on the user s local machine. The secure analysis application may provide increased flexibility in masking and or modifying the user s digital persona to external websites.

Further in accordance with the present disclosure the secure analysis application may be integrated with a translation service to translate textual web content without the web content provider being alerted that a translation is taking place. The secure analysis application may additionally or alternatively be integrated with a temporal and or persistent cloud based storage platform that allows data to be stored between sessions and selectively shared among users in an organization.

Referring now to the Figures shows an exemplary system for providing a user with a secure and anonymous web browsing experience as described herein. Using a secure analysis application e.g. a web browser application running on a user device the user may initiate a web browsing session to access web content via a network e.g. the Internet using one or more secure web containers . In some embodiments initiating a web browsing session includes establishing a communication connection between the user device and one or more other devices based at least in part on one or more wireless and or wired communication protocols as described herein.

During the secure web browsing session and via the secure analysis application the user may select one or more secure web containers e.g. separate web browsers each having a different location e.g. Internet Protocol IP address and or identity e.g. device identification number than the secure analysis application and or the user device in the network through which the web content may be accessed by the user . In this way the one or more secure web containers may serve as separate and secure proxy web browsers for providing the user with the web content while insulating the secure analysis application and or the user device and thus the user from unwanted location and or identity exposure in the network.

Additionally during the secure web browsing session the user may select one or more egress nodes e.g. router outputs through which an IP data packet e.g. the web content enters a public network such as the Internet e.g. the network through which the web content as well as any other data transmitted and or received during the secure web browsing session is to be routed. The one or more egress nodes may each have a different location and or identity than the secure analysis application the user device and or the one or more secure web containers in the network. As such selecting the one or more egress nodes through which web content is to be routed provides an additional layer of security and anonymity.

For example when the user accesses the web content via the secure analysis application a selected secure web container e.g. secure web container of and a selected egress node e.g. egress node of only the identity and or the location of the selected egress node may be exposed in the network as opposed to the location and or the identity of the secure analysis application the user device and or the selected secure web container . By not sharing the location and or the identity of the secure analysis application the user device and or the selected secure web container and instead only sharing the location and or the identity of the selected egress node the location and or the identity of the user may be effectively protected during the secure web browsing session.

As illustrated in the web content may be accessed from one or more web servers which are configured to receive web content requests from the one or more egress nodes . However even though the user may initiate a web content request via the secure analysis application on the user device and using the one or more secure web containers only the location and or the identity of the one or more egress nodes and not the locations and or identities of the secure analysis application the user device and or the one or more secure web containers may be identified by the one or more web servers upon receipt of the web content request.

Because the location and or the identity of the one or more secure web containers as well as the secure analysis application and the user device may not be provided to and or identified by the one or more content servers the one or more content servers may be unaware of the web content s final destination location and or identity. Further the one or more content servers may be unaware of any processing and or requests e.g. application programming interface API requests to be performed to the web content. In this way the user may utilize the secure analysis application to modify change select and or otherwise control the location and or identity provided to various devices e.g. web servers on the network.

For example upon receipt of the web content from the one or more web servers the one or more secure web containers may process the web content to identify and or extract text included in the web content. The one or more secure web containers may then transmit the extracted text to a translation service for translation. In some embodiments the translation service may be performed and or operated by a third party device.

Because the one or more secure web containers extracted and transmitted text from the web content to the translation service as opposed to simply transmitting the web content and or a universal resource locator URL of the web content to the translation service the translation service may be unaware of the web content s origin location and or identity. In this way embodiments described herein provide a double blind manner of providing an anonymous translation service of the web content e.g. a web page that includes text in the sense that both the provider of the web content e.g. the one or more web servers and the translator of the web content e.g. the translation service are unaware of each other as well as any actions previously and or to be performed to the web content.

After translation of the text is completed by the translation service the one or more secure web containers may receive translated text e.g. a transformed version of the text extracted from the web content from the translation service . The one or more secure web containers may generate transformed web content e.g. a web page that displays text in a language different than the language of the text extracted from the web content using the translated text. In this manner the user may utilize various elements described herein to perform anonymous text translations of text included in web content e.g. web pages and to generate transformed web content based on the text translations.

The one or more secure web containers may transmit the web content extracted text translated text transformed web content location and or identity information associated with the user the secure analysis application the user device the one or more secure web containers the one or more egress nodes the one or more web servers and or the translation service user preferences settings and or any other data to a cloud based storage platform for storage. The user may access any data stored in the cloud based storage platform using the secure analysis application and or the one or more secure web containers .

As described above the user may initiate the secure analysis application from the user device e.g. a local machine such as a laptop a desktop a computing device a mobile device and or the like which may communicate with a client interface to instantiate one or more secure web containers . The secure web containers the client interface and or the secure analysis application may be located on a single host machine e.g. computing device and or may be distributed across a networked group of host machines.

Each secure web container may have storage and or processing capabilities as described herein to access web content websites web based applications and other resources hosted on web servers respectively on behalf of the user of the user device . The secure web containers may transcode data received from the web servers to be securely presented to the user at the user device via the secure analysis application . This allows code from a web server to be executed in a sandbox environment provided by a secure web container instead of the user device while still allowing the user to view and interact with content from the web server . Each secure web container may be independently configurable and may be isolated from other secure web containers including those residing upon a common host machine. By providing a highly isolated environment each secure web container minimizes the risks associated with accessing potentially dangerous web content for both the user device and the secure analysis application infrastructure e.g. including the plurality of secure web containers and or the secure analysis application . For example each secure web container may be isolated from the other secure web containers in part by having separate and transient session data that may be purged at the end of each session.

Furthermore the user of the user device may simultaneously launch and operate multiple isolated sandbox environments e.g. secure web containers within the same user session e.g. a period of time when the user is using the secure analysis application each running a particular configuration of a remote browser provided by the secure web containers . Accordingly the user may access the same or different web servers via egress nodes with differently configured remote browsers simultaneously and independently. This allows the user to have increased flexibility in crafting their digital identity when accessing web servers .

For jurisdictional or other reasons it may be beneficial to control the physical location e.g. IP address physical processing device and or storage device of each secure web container that acts as a remote browser to render or execute web content from a web resource e.g. a web server . Multiple servers or other hardware for providing secure web containers may be physically distributed across a region or even globally to provide this level of control.

Because multiple locations in the network e.g. across an organization may be available for utilization and or routing by the secure analysis application the secure web containers and or the egress nodes a system administrator and or the user may select a particular browser location in the network for each of the secure analysis application and or the secure web container as well as the one or more egress nodes through which web content and or information may be transmitted and or routed. Additionally or alternatively individual users may in some embodiments select a specific network location for the secure analysis application the secure web containers and or the egress nodes when beginning a new session and or instantiating a secure web container .

The secure web container s location may not necessarily be available to the web servers that are accessed. Instead an egress node as described below may be used to prevent the web servers from determining the location of the secure web container e.g. browser location or the location of the user s user device .

As described above the secure analysis application and or the secure web containers may utilize a plurality of selectable egress nodes through which the web content may be routed. An egress node is a node by which an IP packet e.g. having an HTTP GET method enters into a public network e.g. the Internet .

There are many scenarios where the user may not want personally identifying information e.g. their IP address and location identity information and or the like to be known by a web server when requesting web content and may thus benefit from masking and or modifying his her digital persona. Furthermore there may be advantages to selecting a particular egress node location independently from the location of the user device and or the secure web containers . For example web servers may be able to alter the presentation of the web content or even the web content itself based on the perceived egress node from which a request arrives. This may allow a malicious website for example to selectively expose the user to malignant code based on their perceived egress node and apparent location. When evaluating the potential threats of a website the user may thus benefit from being able to change their egress node thereby changing their apparent location. It may be noted that this is but one of many scenarios where customisable attribution may be beneficial. Information security applications may be improved by this functionality in that customizable attribution may benefit internal reliability or security testing of a company s own web resources.

As shown in the secure analysis application may utilize various secure web containers e.g. remote web browsers and or various egress nodes all of which may be provided by a networking infrastructure distributed across multiple regions or even globally e.g. on separate devices . In some embodiments a system administrator may allow the user e.g. an information security researcher of the user device to select a location for one or more of the secure web containers and or the egress nodes when the user begins a new session of the secure analysis application . The user s choice may be regionally limited by a specified range e.g. within the continental United States . In some embodiments the system administrator may provision a particular secure web container and or egress node for utilization by the user during a secure web browsing session. If neither the user nor the system administrator specify a location for the secure web containers and or the egress nodes a default secure web container and or egress node may be automatically provided for routing web content from one or more web servers during a secure web browsing session.

In some embodiments an egress node may be randomly selected for a session to avoid repeated access that might provoke suspicion from a targeted web server s administrator. The pool of egress nodes from which a randomly selected egress node may be chosen may share common traits such as region.

While the secure web containers which may receive web content and execute web code from the web server via one or more egress nodes may prevent the web server from determining the location of the user s user device the selected egress node may prevent the web server from determining the location of even the secure web container . By allowing an egress node to be located in the network separately and independently from the host machine hosting the secure web container and or the user device the disclosed principles provide increased flexibility in establishing both remote browser locations e.g. for jurisdictional reasons and apparent locations e.g. for probing the web server with customizable attribution information .

In some embodiments an organization having users of the secure analysis application may receive an expandable package e.g. from the secure analysis application provider that enables a system administrator or user of the organization to create and provide their own egress node whenever and wherever they choose e.g. on an user provided machine and or user device . This manually generated egress node may securely bind with the secure analysis application and may be disabled after one or more uses.

When the user accesses a website e.g. web content through a device e.g. the user device the web server underlying the website may receive a browser fingerprint that defines various aspects of the device . For example the browser fingerprint may describe the type of web browser operating system language support plug ins including version designation resolution location time zone rendering capabilities of the user device and or an identity of the user . This information may be useful for a website e.g. the web server to provide a compatible presentation of web content.

However utilizing a secure web container and or an egress node during a browsing session may prevent the browser fingerprint of the user device from being presented to the web server . Instead locations and or identities associated with the secure web container and or the egress node may be provided to the web server even though the user is accessing the web content via the secure analysis application running on the user device to thereby provide a complete consistent and or credible anonymous identity for the user .

The secure analysis application and or the secure web containers may comprise and or communicate with a database e.g. cloud based storage platform for storing default browser fingerprints that are organized by apparent location e.g. as established by a secure web container and or an egress node . The database may be created by determining browser fingerprints that are most characteristic of a typical user device accessing the web content so that the user is unlikely to stand out e.g. is not suspicious to the web server during the browsing session.

The secure analysis application may allow other elements of the browser fingerprint of each secure web container and or egress node to be altered by a system administrator and or the user . In this way the user and or a system administrator may select locations of secure web containers and or egress nodes . Certain high level information e.g. operating system information browser information software vendor information user information and or the like is generally included in a user agent string that is placed in the header of outgoing messages. These elements are often more easily alterable. A system administrator and or the user may set policies within a policy database associated with the secure analysis application e.g. cloud based storage platform where the policies may allow the user to change certain elements of the user agent information before or even after starting a session of the application.

In some embodiments the browser fingerprint may be randomly assigned for a session. This randomly assigned browser fingerprint may be selected from a pool of browser fingerprints which may each potentially correspond with the selected secure web containers and or selected egress nodes associated with the session e.g. as selected by the user by the system administrator or randomly .

As described above the translation service may be integrated with the secure analysis application by communicating with the secure web containers . In many scenarios a web server may provide textual web content that is in a different language than desired by the user at the user device . The secure analysis application may help enable the translation of web content from the web server without alerting and or directly contacting the web server with an external web translation request.

When the user chooses to view a web page having foreign language text the user may send a request specifying the requested web content to the web server via the secure analysis application and or the secure web container . For example the request could be an HTTP GET message requesting content and may be routed from the secure web container to the web server by way of a particular egress node . The secure web container may enable the user to specify a preferred language for content to be translated into and received by the user . In some embodiments the preferred language may be established during the initiation of the session associated with the secure web container .

The secure web container may send a modified request to the web server where identifying information e.g. user agent information of the user device is removed and or replaced with information associated with the secure web container and or the egress node through which the request is routed and or the web content is routed. This request may also be sent through a selectable or randomized egress node not shown as described above.

The secure web container may receive the requested content from the web server through the egress node . The secure web container may analyze the received content to identify textual content. If the secure analysis application detects that the language of the identified textual content is different from a preferred language as specified by the user the identified textual content and preferred language may be sent in a translation request to the translation service . It would also be possible for the secure analysis application to send all textual content associated with a particular web page through the translation service based on pre configured information.

In some embodiments the translation service may provide an application programming interface API for sending and receiving information and the translation request may be an API call. The secure web container may receive translated textual content from the translation service . The secure web container may then render a full presentation of requested content using the translated textual content e.g. replacing the initially detected textual content with the translated textual content received from the translation service . In this manner the user may then view the requested content in the preferred language.

Alternatively the user of the user device may first view the secure web container s rendering of the web content in its native language e.g. untranslated textual content . The user may then request the secure web container to provide translations for some or all of the textual content. The secure web container may then communicate with the translation service as described above to obtain the translated textual content and may then re render a presentation for the viewing via the secure analysis application running on the user device having at least some of the textual content in the preferred language.

As the translation service does not communicate directly with the web server the web server may be unaware that any translation is being performed. Instead the web server may merely detect a content request from the secure web container or a corresponding egress node that resembles other requests typically received by the web server . Similarly the translation service may be unaware that the textual content was extracted from a particular web page.

As described above the secure analysis application and or the secure web container may be integrated with a temporal or persistent cloud based storage platform capable of storing both transient and persistent data. In some scenarios the user may want to store web content and or textual content downloaded from a web server for analysis or other purposes. However locally storing these files on the user device may be non ideal for various reasons including the sensitivity of the information contained in the files or the potential for the content to be malicious in nature.

To avoid resorting to storage on the user device while still maintaining their transient and secure properties secure web containers may be securely integrated with the cloud based storage platform as described herein. For example web content received by the secure web container from the web server may be sent to the storage platform to be stored even after a session involving the secure web container is completed.

The cloud based storage platform may then store the content either permanently or temporarily and may ensure that the content can only be accessed from authorized secure web containers and not from other clients such as a local browser. Accordingly the cloud based storage platform may be one mechanism by which data may securely persist after the secure web container is collapsed and or deactivated. The content may be accessed by the same user or by a different user through a second secure web container and a second user device not pictured at a later time.

The cloud based storage platform may be implemented with multiple layers to enhance security. In some embodiments the cloud based storage platform may have encrypted data stores having nondescript naming conventions and flat or otherwise obfuscated directory structures. Additionally the placement of new files within these data stores may be random or otherwise obscured. The files on the data stores may be encrypted through a variety of techniques. In some embodiments the data stores may be encrypted using symmetric keys that are centrally managed by the provider of the secure analysis application . In other embodiments the data stores may be asymmetrically encrypted using public keys provided by an end user such that only the end user and not even the secure analysis application provider may privately access the files within the data store. As the contents of the data store may be encrypted the files and directory stored by the data store may not be directly browsable e.g. without a mapping table and or an encryption key . Therefore unauthorized systems such as a local browser may be restricted from viewing the contents and even the file directory or any other logical representation associated with the data store. Accordingly the data store itself may be conveniently stored in a third party storage layer e.g. Amazon s Simple Storage Service S3 within near or within a user s physical premises or other storage locations. The cloud based storage platform may further comprise a mapping table linked to the encrypted data stores. In some embodiments the mapping table may provide a meaningful data structure and set of file names for the data located in the encrypted data stores. The mapping table may in some embodiments be stored and provided by the secure analysis application provider.

In some embodiments the above described security features e.g. encryption random file placement obfuscated directory structures may all be implemented and in other embodiments a subset of the security features may be implemented in combination. Numerous other security features may additionally or alternatively be implemented.

The data stores of the cloud based storage platform may be divided into separate classes. For example some data stores may be persistent whereas other data stores may be ephemeral or transient. This may provide greatly increase flexibility in establishing and enforcing data retention rules. For example in some embodiments a system administrator may want to restrict content that is associated with a particular secure web container user or web server from being stored for more than a certain amount of time. As such content falling into this scope may be automatically placed within a transient data store of the cloud based storage platform where it may be deleted after a set amount of time or at a particular date and time. In some scenarios a transient data store may expire at the end of a session or after a set number of web browsing sessions.

The cloud based storage platform may restrict access to the data that it contains. For example the cloud based storage platform may be provisioned at an organization level with portions dedicated to individual users and other portions acting as shared drives between multiple users or even an entire organization. A system administrator and or the user may select the geographic region or regions for the physical locations of the data store s used for their organization e.g. for jurisdictional and or user policy reasons .

The secure web containers may provide users with file browsers for accessing the encrypted data store s within the cloud based storage platform . The file browsers may also be used to upload files to a third party service not pictured such as a file analysis service. The cloud based storage platform may further provide a secure external application programming interface API that allows individuals and organizations to pull data from or push data to the encrypted data stores without using the secure web containers .

The cloud based storage platform may be configurable by the user or system administrators to accommodate many different scenarios. For example a set of stored files may be restricted to a single user who may re instantiate her his secure web container to access the content. The user may also choose to share folders or particular files initially allocated to her him with other users within an organization. When sharing data the user may specify a time period for which the data may be shared with another user or the user may share the data indefinitely. In addition the user may restrict certain file rights. These file rights may include downloading a shared file from the data store e.g. to their secure web container executing a shared file editing a shared file uploading to a shared folder and printing a shared file among other file rights. The user or system administrators within an organization may also configure data retention rules such that data is removed from the cloud based storage platform after an established period of time or a deletion triggering event as discussed above.

In some embodiments the cloud based storage platform may be configured by policy to interact with the file system of the secure analysis application and or the user device . If the system administrator enables this interaction then the user may have the ability to transfer content between her his user device and the cloud based storage platform e.g. both upload and download . Conversely a policy may restrict interaction between the user device and the cloud based storage platform so that users may be able to download content to the cloud based storage platform when visiting web servers via the secure analysis application and or the secure web container but may not be permitted to transfer files between the file system of the user device and or the secure web container and the cloud based storage platform in either direction.

Session data that is accumulated during the use of a secure web container may generally be purged from the secure web container after the session is complete. However in some embodiments log entries corresponding to the sessions may be stored and compiled in a log database e.g. cloud based storage platform before or upon session completion.
