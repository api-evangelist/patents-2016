In exemplary embodiments various permissions for various information can be tiered such that different recipients are entitled to receive access to different spot alert data information and or various information at the same and or different locations from other approved recipients.

Referring to in exemplary embodiments for example referring to step F a participant e.g. user who originates a spot user who creates a location etc. can create locations e.g. spots by for example being in the physical location of the spot they wish to create with a mobile electronic device referred to as mobile electronic device spot creation and or by manually entering the variables affiliated with a spot from a static electronic device referred to as static electronic device creation.

In exemplary embodiments the process for creating a spot can be substantially similar whether done utilizing a mobile electronic device and or static electronic device. In exemplary embodiments where a mobile electronic device is used locations e.g. spots can be generated by using location information affiliated with the mobile electronic device such as GPS. In exemplary embodiments where a static electronic device is used a spot can be generated by using location information affiliated with the static electronic device such as IP address. In exemplary embodiments using a mobile electronic device and or a static electronic device coordinates can be entered manually by the participant in appropriate forms such as but not limited to the form of an address latitude coordinates and or longitude coordinates to name a few. In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods disclosed can utilize a location based API or other application such as Google Maps to for example display locations e.g. spots graphically.

Further in exemplary embodiments each spot can include variables including but not limited to spot name spot coordinates spot category spot permissions spot tone spot picture and on the spot to name a few. In exemplary embodiments a participant who creates a spot and or location can be referred to as the spot originator and or location originator. The spot can be given a name that can be a descriptive title given by the spot originator and or location originator to describe a given spot. Spot coordinates can be the Cartesian grid e.g. GPS coordinates coordinates of a spot.

In exemplary embodiments spots can be categorized e.g. spot categories that can define the classification of a spot e.g. spot food spot fun spot shop spot drink spot entertainment spot activity a spot experiences etc. . Spot permissions can define which spot mates and or mates have access to a given spot. A spot tone can be a ring tone and or a participant recorded audio segment designated by the spot originator and or location originator which plays when a spot alert and or spot comment is for example activated. An audio e.g. a spot recording and or visual transmission e.g. a spot picture a spot video etc. can be attached and or created any participant for example when they are writing at a spot and or location and when creating and or editing information about a spot and or location to name a few. Various transmissions from various participants can be aggregated into a feed of comments submitted by participants and or displayed uniquely for each individual spot to name a few.

Referring to in exemplary embodiments for example referring to step G locations e.g. spots can be searched using various techniques such as but not limited to a near me search a keyword search and or a category search to name a few. Searches can access the pre existing web application interface to retrieve the data regarding variables affiliated with various spots locations spot alerts and spot comments to name a few. A near me search can allow a participant to search for locations e.g. spots they have permission to access. For example this search method can provide the participant with a map identifying locations e.g. spots surrounding them on a map based on for example their current GPS location.

In exemplary embodiments cache location e.g. spot can be identified by a color code that can be directly correlated to a category affiliated with that location. These category color codes can be assigned by participants and or can be automatically assigned for example at a later date by participants and or by any of the systems and or methods disclosed to name a few.

In exemplary embodiments a keyword search can allow participants to search all of their spot mates locations e.g. spots based participant input for example a defined string of text. By way of example if this defined string of text appears in the spot of any spot mates locations e.g. spots and in which the participant has been given the appropriate spot permissions that spot can then appear in the keyword search results.

In exemplary embodiments a category search can allow participants to search all of their spot mates locations e.g. spots based on categories affiliated with various spots. By way of example if the requested spot category matches any spot mates locations e.g. spots and which the participant has been given the appropriate spot permissions that spot can appear in the category search results. Further in exemplary embodiments spot search results can be sorted by the distance from the current location of the participant.

Referring to in exemplary embodiments for example referring to step H when a participant physically enters into the area of a spot that they have the proper permissions to access with a mobile electronic device they can receive a spot alert and or spot comment on their mobile electronic device. As discussed below this spot alert and or spot comment can consist of a spot ringtone jingle picture light box etc. to name a few. Further after receiving the spot notification the participant can then be able to view the spot variables write about the spot e.g. while on that spot create and or edit other information and or upload their own spot transmissions e.g. pictures audio transmissions video transmissions etc. to name a few. In exemplary embodiments participants can opt out of any spot. Participants can also create additional locations e.g. spots and or create additional spot alerts and or spot comments for various locations.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods can transmit spot alerts and or spot comments based on spot alert data information such that recipient mobile electronic devices can have spot alerts and or spot comments received displayed played and or actuated for example when that recipient mobile electronic device is located within a spot location and or predefined range from a predetermined location. This spot alert data information can be based on variables such as but not limited to information such as but not limited to mobile recipient device information mobile recipient device location information mobile recipient device identification information location information spot alert data information respective spot location information respective spot range information respective spot comment information and respective spot approved recipient information and any other form of information affiliated with any number of locations that can be analyzed to determine whether spot alerts and or spot comments should be transmitted to recipient mobile electronic devices.

In exemplary embodiments the spot alert data information can include respective spot approved recipient information such that a user can restrict the transmission of spot comments based on variables such as but not limited to spot alert data information respective spot location information respective spot range information respective spot comment information and respective spot approved recipient information to name a few. Further in exemplary embodiments the user can restrict the transmission of spot comments to specific recipients groups of recipients and or tiers of recipients to name a few.

In exemplary embodiments to input information such as a user restricting the transmission of spot comments users amongst others can access a website such as a social networking interface and or website that can include automatically populated information for example using user electronic devices. Further in exemplary embodiments to input information such as add locations spot comments and spot alert data information to name a few users and or recipients amongst others can access a website and or application such as a social networking interface and or website for example using recipient mobile electronic devices.

In exemplary embodiments the inputting of information can be from users and recipients such that information can be created modified edited deleted and or aggregated using user electronic devices and or recipient mobile electronic devices. Further information can be received from transmitted to and or input using a website such as a social networking interface and or website e mail providers contact lists and or any other source of information to name a few.

In exemplary embodiments participants can update spot alerts and or spot comments based on the location of other participants. For example if a recipient is detected as having passed a location e.g. using triangulation another participant can transmit a spot alert and or spot comment to that recipient. By way of example if a recipient is detected as having missed a location e.g. a turn off point on route to a ski house a user can create a spot alert and or transmission alerting the user that they have missed the location. Of course other participants and or the systems and or methods can automatically and or in response to another participant missing a location create a spot alert and or spot comment.
