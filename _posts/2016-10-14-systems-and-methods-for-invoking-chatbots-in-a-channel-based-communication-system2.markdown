title: Systems and methods for invoking chatbots in a channel based communication system
abstract: Disclosed systems and methods join a user to pre-existing primary communication channels based upon the information obtained from a user profile. Each channel hosts a different plurality of users and facilitates electronic communication between a corresponding enterprise data source and a remote user device associated with the user. The user is joined to one or more sub-channels associated within a primary channel. A message posted by the user is received and comprises a key identifying a sub-channel, an API token identifying the user, and a first communication. In response, an automated human interface module (bot), which includes a node graph to direct one or more states of a conversation, posts a responsive message including the key, the API token, and a second communication. The API token and key route the responsive message to the user device thereby initiating a secure conversation between the user device and an enterprise data source.

The present disclosure relates generally to secure mobile communications platforms that provide primary communication channels. Users connect to primary communication channels and in so doing engage in secure bidirectional communication with enterprise data sources associated with such channels thereby enabling the enterprise data sources to respond directly or broadcast messages to users.

Enterprise data sources use different types of communication systems to connect with end users such as consumers. For example some enterprise data sources rely on electronic mail email telephone etc. to communicate with consumers who in turn can respond to the enterprise data sources. However email communication systems are more than two decades old not secure typically laced with spam a primary deliverer of viruses cluttered are error prone and are a cause for disconnects between enterprise data sources and consumers. Anyone who has tried to obtain customer support using a telephone system will appreciate that call centers do not improve the situation. A consumer must listen to numerous recorded messages navigate through countless menus and start all over if there is a single incorrect number entered. Moreover the consumer once lucky enough to reach a live operator is often transferred often more than once each time providing countless security credentials in order to provide some modicum of security to the call. Thus typical communication systems do not facilitate direct and secure performance of transactions with consumers.

Hence there is a long felt but unresolved need for computer implemented systems and methods that replace conventional email communication systems and call in systems and facilitate secure bidirectional communication and transactions with consumers in real time.

The present disclosure addresses the above identified shortcomings. Systems and methods are provided for receiving identification information from remote user devices associated with users. The identification information serves to obtain corresponding stored user profiles for the users. Primary communication channels are generated for each user based upon such profiles. In typical embodiments such primary communication channels are already preexisting and the act of generating a primary communication channel from the user perspective means joining the primary communication channel and from the enterprise data source perspective means adding the user to the pre existing primary communication channel. Each such primary channel is limited to communication with and facilitates electronic communication between a single corresponding enterprise data source e.g. businesses and users.

For each respective primary channel in a subset of the primary channels associated with a first user a corresponding plurality of sub channels is generated based upon their profile. Here again in typical embodiments such sub channels are pre existing and the act of generating a sub channel channel from the user perspective means joining the sub channel and from the enterprise data source perspective means adding a conversation between the enterprises data source and the user to the pre existing sub channel. Each such plurality of sub channels forms a corresponding hierarchical tree with the corresponding primary channel as root node and the sub channels as child nodes. In other words each primary channel of each enterprise data source is associated with a plurality of sub channels organized into a hierarchy. A sub channel in a hierarchy of sub channels enables secure bidirectional communication between i the remote user device associated with the first user and ii the enterprise data source associated with the primary channel of the hierarchy. More specifically a sub channel in a hierarchy of sub channels enables a plurality of conversations and each such conversation has secure bidirectional conversation between i a single remote user device associated with the first user and ii the enterprise data source associated with the primary channel of the hierarchy. Thus an enterprise data source may invoke a number of sub channels each such sub channel hosting a plurality of conversations but each such conversation limited to the enterprise data source e.g. an automated human interface module associated with the sub channel or a live operator associated with the enterprise data source . With such a platform users connect to primary communication channels and in so doing interact with enterprise data sources in secure bidirectional communication enabling enterprise data sources to respond directly or broadcast messages to their entire audience of users.

One aspect of the present disclosure provides a method comprising at a server system comprising one or more processors and memory receiving identification information from a remote user device associated with a first user. The identification information for the first user comprises a unique identifier for the first user. The unique identifier is used to obtain characteristic information from a user profile corresponding to the first user that is stored in one or more data stores. The first user is joined to a plurality of pre existing primary communication channels based upon the user profile information for the first user. Each primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels is limited to communication with a single corresponding enterprise data source in a plurality of enterprise data sources and facilitates electronic communication between the single corresponding enterprise data source and the first user. Each primary communication channel in the plurality of communication channels hosts a different plurality of users. In the method for each respective primary communication channel in at least a subset of the plurality of primary communication channels associated with the first user the first user is joined to a corresponding plurality of pre existing sub channels based upon the user profile information for the first user. In some embodiments this is done automatically without human intervention. The plurality of sub channels form a corresponding hierarchical tree in which the corresponding primary communication channel is a root node and the plurality of sub channels are child nodes. A sub channel in each of the corresponding hierarchy of sub channels enables a secure bidirectional conversation between i a remote user device associated with the first user and ii the enterprise data source associated with the primary communication channel of the corresponding hierarchical tree. In this way secure exchange of a first plurality of messages between the corresponding enterprise data source and the remote user device associated with the first user within the sub channel is facilitated. The sub channel hosts a plurality of conversations each conversation in the plurality of conversations limited to the corresponding enterprise data source and a different single user in a plurality of users. In some embodiments unique identifier of the first user is a contact number of the user. In some embodiments a depth of a hierarchical tree associated with a primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels is N where N is a positive integer greater than one e.g. N is two N is three N is four or greater etc. .

Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method comprising at a server system comprising one or more processors and memory using a unique identifier received from a first user to obtain characteristic information from a user profile corresponding to the first user that is stored in one or more data stores. The first user is then joined to a plurality of pre existing primary communication channels based upon the user profile information for the first user where each primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels facilitates electronic communication between a corresponding enterprise data source and a first remote user device associated with the first user. Each primary communication channel in the plurality of communication channels hosts a different plurality of users. The first user is joined for a first primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels associated with the first user to one or more pre existing sub channels associated with the first primary communication channel. A first message that is posted by the first user is received. The first message comprises a a key identifying a first sub channel in the one or more pre existing sub channels b a first application programming interface token identifying the first user and c a first communication. Responsive to the first message a first automated human interface module is initiated to engage in electronic conversation with the first user using the first sub channel. The first automated human interface module includes a first node graph. The first node graph comprises a first plurality of nodes and a first plurality of edges. Each edge in the first plurality of edges connects two nodes in the first plurality of nodes. A second message that is posted by the first automated human interface module is received. The second message includes a the key identifying the first sub channel b the first application programming interface token identifying the first user and c a second communication responsive to the first communication. The first application programming interface token and the key are used to route the second message to the first remote user device within the first sub channel thereby initiating a first secure bidirectional conversation between i the first remote user device associated with the first user and ii a first enterprise data source associated with the first primary communication channel. The first node graph directs one or more states of the first secure bidirectional conversation.

In some embodiments the first sub channel further comprises a second secure bidirectional conversation between i a second remote user device associated with a second user and ii the first enterprise data source.

In some embodiments an identity of the first survey automated human interface module is determined by an identity of the first primary communication channel.

In some embodiments the method further comprises using the survey of the first user to generate a net promotor score for the first secure bidirectional conversation and making the net promotor score available to an administrator associated with the first sub channel or the enterprise data source corresponding to the first primary communication channel. In some such embodiments the net promotor score comprises a plurality of questions and the net promotor score is determined from the answers provided by the first user to the plurality of questions. In some embodiments the net promotor score associated with each conversation in a plurality of conversations associated with the first sub channel or the first primary communication channel is aggregated thereby forming an aggregate net promotor score. Further this aggregate net promotor score is made available to the administrator associated with the first sub channel or the enterprise data source corresponding to the first primary communication channel. In some such embodiments conversations occurring in the first sub channel prior to a predetermined period of time e.g. prior to the past day prior to the past week prior to the past month are excluded from the plurality of conversations that are aggregated to form the aggregate net promotor score. In some embodiments the individual net promotor scores of conversations terminating more recently are given more weight than the individual net promotor scores of conversations ending less recently when forming the aggregate net promotor score.

In some embodiments the first sub channel is monitored by a first live agent serving in a role as a sub channel administrator for the sub channel. Further the method also comprises using the survey of the first user to generate a net promotor score for the first secure bidirectional conversation aggregating the net promotor score associated with each conversation in a plurality of conversations associated with the first sub channel thereby forming an aggregate net promotor score and making the aggregate net promotor score available to the first live agent or the enterprise data source corresponding to the first primary communication channel.

The users e.g. consumers can subscribe to offers provided by the enterprise data sources e.g business entities and transmit messages associated with multiple topics to the enterprise data sources via the communications module C.

Now that details of a SMCP that provides enterprise data sources as primary communication channels in searchable catalogs has been described a flow chart of processes and features of the system in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure are disclosed with reference to .

One aspect of the present disclosure provides a method performed at a secure mobile communications platform e.g. server system comprising one or more processors and memory in which there is received for each respective user in a plurality of users identification information from a remote user device associated with the respective user. The identification information for each respective user in the plurality of users comprises a unique identifier for the respective user. In some embodiments the unique identifier is a unique identification number assigned to the user after the user has enrolled with the secure mobile communications platform. In some such embodiments the user does not have access to the unique identifier . For instance in some embodiments the user chooses a login and enrolls in the secure mobile communications platform whereupon the user is assigned the unique identifier which is stored on the user device associated with the user and or in the profile associated with the user. In some instances the unique identifier is stored in an encrypted format. Then when the user logs into the secure mobile communications platform the unique identifier is automatically sent to the secure mobile communications platform or retrieved from the user s profile as part of the login in process of block . In some alternative embodiments the unique identifier is a login chosen by the user and assigned to the user once the uniqueness of the login has been verified e.g. no other user has already chosen the login and the login is deemed to be robust enough to serve as a login .

Turning to block for each respective user in the plurality of users the unique identifier of the respective user is used to obtain characteristic information from a user profile corresponding to the respective user that is stored across one or more data stores. The secure mobile communications platform retrieves characteristic information of each of the users e.g. consumers also referred to herein as end users using the unique identifier from one or more databases e.g. user profile database for example by performing a database lookup based on the unique identifier. In some embodiments the characteristic information comprises for example demographic information consumer preferences on different subjects or topics location information etc. of each of the users. For instance referring to in some embodiments user profiles are stored in user profile database of secure mobile communications platform . However in alternative embodiments the user profile is stored on the remote user device e.g. in encrypted format . provides more details of a user profile database in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. In the user profile database a user profile is stored for each user. In some embodiments a user profile for a respective user includes the unique identifier of the user e.g. a contact number of the user the name of the user the geographic address e.g. street address of the user as well as one or more E mail and or social media addresses of the user. Further the profile details the primary communication channels to which the user has subscribed. For those primary communication channels in which the user is able to select which sub channels are invoked a description of the sub channels the user has invoked are also included in the profile of the user . Such a situation is illustrated in where the primary channel associated with the enterprise data source ZAGAT is illustrated and the user is able to turn off and on the sub channels Discover Best Places Latest Buzz and New Openings . In some instances the user does not get to select which sub channels of a primary communication channel are invoked and in such instances information regarding sub channels for such primary communication channels is not stored in the user profile. provide additional examples of this feature. In some embodiments the user profile of a user additionally stores the identifier of each conversation in each sub channel that the user is presently participating in.

Turning to block of as part of the user login process a respective plurality of primary communication channels is generated for each respective user in the plurality of users based upon the information stored in the user profile for the respective user.

In typical embodiments these primary communication channels already existed with other users connected to them and the generating involves joining the user to such primary communication channels . Each primary communication channel in each respective plurality of primary communication channels 1 enables one to one communication between a corresponding enterprise data source in a plurality of enterprise data sources and a respective user in the plurality of users and 2 facilitates electronic communication between the single corresponding enterprise data source and the single respective user. For instance user A associated with remote user device logs into the secure mobile communications platform . As part of the login process the user profile of the user is obtained. From the user profile a list of primary communication channels that the user is associated with is obtained. Each of these primary communication channels is generated e.g. activated . In some embodiments no action takes place when generating the plurality of communication channels other than to display a representation of these channels on the display of the corresponding remote user device. For instance referring to generating the plurality of primary communication channels for a first user involves displaying an icon for each of the primary channels. In particular each provide an illustration of a graphical user interface provided by communication module C on a remote user device after completion of block in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. An icon is provided for each primary communication channel . Such primary communication channels are interchangeably referred to herein as Pypes. Further it is quite likely that a number of other users are already engaged with these primary communication channels when the first user log in.

If there has been communication e.g. messages from the corresponding enterprise data source posted to a sub channel associated with a given primary channel for a given user e.g. posted to the conversation associated with the user in the sub channel since the last time that user has logged in a count icon is displayed that numerically indicates the number of such messages that have been posted to the sub channels of that primary channel since the last time the user has checked the sub channels. For instance referring to two messages have been posted on conversations in the sub channels for the primary channel Pypestream since that last time the user has opened the icon for that primary channel on the remote user device . Further referring to a message has been posted in a conversation on one of the sub channels for the primary channel Target since that last time the user has opened the icon for Target on the remote user device .

In typical embodiments although each primary communication channel enables one to one communication between the corresponding enterprise data source and a respective user and 2 facilitates electronic communication between the single corresponding enterprise data source and the respective user messages are not typically communicated between the enterprise data source and the remote user devices on the primary communication channel . Rather sub channels associated with the primary channel are used for this purpose as discussed in further detail below.

To build the profile of primary channels associated with a user the user can request to establish a primary channel with any enterprise data source e.g. business entity by using the secure mobile security platform . In an embodiment referring to for illustration at a remote user device the client side version of communications module C lists a description of available enterprise data sources obtained from catalog module of the secure mobile security platform . Further a user may enter an alphanumeric query for enterprise data sources of interest using prompt . Referring to as the user enters the alphanumeric query enterprise data sources from the digital catalog that match the partial query are displayed. In this way users can search through the digital catalog and request to establish e.g. join a primary channel with a selected enterprise data source . In some embodiments the secure mobile communications platform generates revenue by charging each enterprise data source e.g. business entity a fee for example a monthly fee for listing them in the digital catalog .

Referring to block in some embodiments an enterprise data source has access rights to each primary communication channel and each sub channel corresponding to the enterprise data source. The enterprise data source designates access permission to the primary communication channel to one or more primary communication channel administrators and each respective sub channel to one or more sub channel administrators . The one or more sub channel administrators are independent of the one or more primary communication channel administrators.

Referring to block of in some embodiments an enterprise data source is a store a chain of stores a government institution or service a corporate entity an organization or a social organization.

As discussed above each primary channel includes one or more sub channels. During the login process the sub channels of the primary channels associated with a user are generated. In other words referring to block of there is generated for each respective primary communication channel in at least a subset of the plurality of primary communication channels of a first user in the plurality of users a corresponding plurality of sub channels based upon the user profile information for the first user automatically without human intervention. In typical embodiments these sub channels already existed with other users connected to them and the generating involves adding a conversation to the sub channel between the user and the enterprise data source that other users may not participate in.

Each of the plurality of sub channels forms a corresponding hierarchical tree in which the corresponding primary communication channel is a root node and the plurality of sub channels are child nodes. illustrates such a hierarchical tree. The primary channel Zagat is the root node and the sub channels Discover Best Places Latest Buzz and New Openings are child nodes. At least one sub channel in each of the corresponding hierarchy of sub channels enables secure bidirectional conversation between i a remote user device associated with the first user and ii the enterprise data source associated with the primary communication channel of the corresponding hierarchical tree thereby facilitating secure exchange of a plurality of messages between the corresponding enterprise data source and the remote user device associated with the first user within the at least one sub channel . Each such conversation includes only a single user associated with a remote user device although a sub channel may host any number of conversations each such conversation between the corresponding enterprise data source and a respective user.

As illustrated in the communications module C operating on remote user device renders a graphical communications interface for example in an electronic mail email layout on the remote user device for enabling bidirectional communication of messages and content between the user and the enterprise data source in real time through a sub channel . The content comprises for example one or more of messages e.g. messages and of image content e.g. image of audio content video content audiovisual content multimedia content animations digital content email content voicemail content document content files etc. and any combination thereof. As illustrated in the graphical communications interface combines a peer to peer chat application with an email layout on the consumer device to create the graphical communication interface. In some embodiments the secure mobile communication platform encodes each of the messages and the content using strong encryption technologies for example public key cryptography with a private key such as a personal identification number PIN and a two factor authentication and facilitates a secure transmission and a secure reception of the messages and the content through the sub channel via the rendered graphical communication interface . As used herein public key cryptography refers to a class of cryptographic algorithms that requires a private key and a public key. Also as used herein two factor authentication refers to an unambiguous identification of a user using a combination of two different components which a user knows or possesses. In an embodiment the secure mobile communications platform securely stores the encoded messages and the encoded content in one or more databases and or in the consumer devices. The secure mobile communications platform uses different types of encoding methods for secure storage and secure transmission of the messages and the content. In an embodiment the secure mobile communications platform offers different levels of security based on a user s security needs. For example the secure mobile communications platform provides a RSA hardware certificate a RSA SECURID of the EMC corporation or a one time key or token to consumers who require a high level of security. In an embodiment the secure mobile communications platform receives and sends requests for establishing primary communication channels between enterprise data sources and users via the communications module C of .

Referring to block in some embodiments a depth of the hierarchical tree associated with a primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels is N where N is a positive integer greater than one e.g. N is 2 3 4 or greater than 4 . illustrates a hierarchical tree with a depth of two where the primary channel is the root node and each of the sub channels are direct child nodes to the primary channel. However the present disclosure is not so limited. For instance some sub channels may be child nodes to other child nodes leading to hierarchical trees with depths of 3 or greater. illustrates a hierarchical tree in which the primary communication channel is a root node and the sub channels in the plurality of sub channels are child nodes in which the hierarchical tree has a depth of four. Sub channels and are respective child nodes to sub channels and which in turn are respective child nodes to sub channel which in turn is a sub node to primary channel . In the hierarchical tree illustrated in secure bidirectional communication occurs between i a remote user device associated with the first user and ii the enterprise data source associated with the primary communication channel of the corresponding hierarchical tree on one or more of the sub channels .

Thus in typical embodiments the secure mobile communications platform generates one or more sub channels from each of the established primary channels associated with each user s unique identifier based on the received characteristic information for communicating with each of the users and for facilitating one or more transactions with each of the consumers within the generated sub channels . The secure mobile communications platform provides complete transaction support inside a sub channel . Using the secure mobile communications platform enterprise data sources e.g. business entities can establish one or more primary communication channels with their users e.g. consumers after which sub channels covering different subjects and topics and offering transaction services can be established once the users have opted in to particular sub channels . Within each sub channel a user participating in a private secure conversation with the enterprise data source can reply to a transaction message for example an electronic commerce e commerce offer message by purchasing the ecommerce offer as disclosed in the examples below. The secure mobile communications platform implements e commerce using one or more payment infrastructures for example STRIPE of Stripe Inc. PAYPAL of PayPal Inc. etc.

Consider an example where an enterprise data source e.g. business entity such as the STARWOOD Hotel of Starwood Capital Group LLC with a promotions team establishes a primary channel with a consumer e.g. user . The secure primary communications platform retrieves characteristic information of the consumer e.g. user profile of the user from one or more databases e.g. user profile database using the consumer s unique identifier for example the consumer s contact number. The consumer indicates e.g. through user preferences interests in their user profile of an inclination to avail themselves of exclusive offers for example exclusive deals and exclusive packages from the STARWOOD Hotel via the established primary channel . The secure mobile communication platform generates a sub channel for exclusive offers named for example Special and the promotions team of STARWOOD Hotel sends the exclusive deals and the exclusive packages with discounts to the consumer via a conversation in the sub channel . The secure mobile communication platform allows the user e.g. consumer to perform a transaction for example buying of an exclusive package based on an exclusive deal within the generated sub channel using one or more payment infrastructures. Because other users cannot participate in the conversation the transaction cannot be repudiated and privacy is ensured.

Using the secure primary communications platform e.g. channel based communication and transaction system any enterprise data source e.g. business entity can offer an electronic commerce channel or an electronic shopping channel. Through this electronic commerce channel or electronic shopping channel the secure primary communications platform allows the enterprise data source to send deals and packages to a user e.g. consumer in real time and allows the consumer to make purchases therewithin. Consider an example where an enterprise data source for example the W Miami Hotel of Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc. offers a three night package for 500 to the first 500 consumers who opt in to purchase the package. The W Miami Hotel establishes a primary channel with each of the users e.g. consumers via the secure primary communications platform . If the consumers indicate an inclination to avail offers from the W Miami Hotel via the established primary communication channel the secure primary communications platform generates a sub channel for example an eShop sub channel by adding a conversation to the sub channel for the user and transmits a communication of the three night package for 500 through this conversation hosted on the eShop sub channel. Furthermore the secure primary communications platform facilitates a transaction service within the eShop sub channel when the consumer opts in to buy the three night package thereby facilitating a transaction or trading of the three night package within the eShop sub channel in real time. In an embodiment the secure primary communications platform identifies a new user e.g. consumer based on a location of the remote user device associated with the new user for example via a positioning system and sends a hotel deal to the new user for a night stay using the sub channel . In an embodiment the secure primary communications platform generates revenue from a percentage of a transaction amount associated with each transaction made within the sub channel .

The secure mobile communication platform SMCB provides a spam free communication experience to users e.g. consumers as the SMCB does not allow transactions to be performed in the primary channel in typical embodiments. In an embodiment the SMCB provides a channel permissions mechanism that sets a semaphore flag for the sub channel for example to true or false. By design the SMCB does not allow or display transactions in the primary communication channel. The SMCB provides access control lists ACLs to enterprise data sources for fine grained control of what can occur in the primary channel or the sub channels . For instance in the example described above for the W Miami Hotel the SMCB sends deals and packages through conversations hosted by the eShop sub channel . If a user receives an offer in a non eShop sub channel then that would be considered as spam which is prevented by the SMCB . The SMCB does not send messages or chats in the primary channel . The SMCB sends general information related to the enterprise data source for example updated sub channel news names of new sub channels log or information tracking subscriptions to the sub channels disconnections from the sub channels etc. through the primary channel .

In another example an enterprise data source e.g. business entity for example the EQUINOX organization of Equinox Holdings Inc. offers a discount on a package for spinning classes. The SMCB establishes a primary channel with a user e.g. consumer and transmits general information related to the enterprise data source through the established primary channel . If the user indicates an inclination to avail themselves of offers from the EQUINOX organization via the established primary channel the SMCB generates a sub channel for example an eShop sub channel e.g. by adding a conversation to the eShop sub channel between EQUINOX and the user transmits a communication on the discounted package through the conversation in the eShop sub channel and provides a transaction service where the user can opt in to buy the discounted package via the eShop sub channel . The SMCB therefore generates and uses live real time primary channels and sub channels to deliver product and services to users e.g. consumers on a transaction basis.

In typical embodiments an enterprise data source uses the same sub channel to communicate with multiple users. While the enterprise data source can review messages sent by each of these users each respective user cannot see messages sent by the enterprise data source to other users nor can they see messages originated by other users. Accordingly in some embodiments a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels comprises e.g. hosts a first secure bidirectional conversation between i a first remote user device associated with the first user and ii the enterprise data source associated with the primary communication channel of the corresponding hierarchical tree thereby facilitating secure exchange of the first plurality of messages. Moreover the first sub channel comprises e.g. hosts a second secure bidirectional conversation between i a second remote user device associated with a second user and ii the enterprise data source associated with the primary communication channel of the corresponding hierarchical tree thereby facilitating secure exchange of a second plurality of messages. The first user cannot see any of the messages in the second plurality of messages. The second user cannot see any of the messages in the first plurality of messages. The enterprise data source can see all the messages in the first plurality of messages and the second plurality of messages.

In some embodiments this above described one to one aspect of the communication between a given enterprise data source and respective users is imposed using application program interface API keys and tokens where the API key identifies a particular enterprise data source resource such as a particular sub channel belonging to a particular enterprise data source resource and the API token indicates the identity of source message or content. For instance in such embodiments when the enterprise data source wishes to post content on a particular sub channel a content post request is made which includes the message or content to be posted to the sub channel . The post request further includes the API key thereby identifying the correct sub channel of the enterprise data source and the API token thereby identifying the originator of the content or message here the enterprise data source . In some such embodiments the API token not only serves to identify the originator of the content it also serves to designate what access privileges the originator of the content or message have over the sub channel . In some embodiments the post request will further include a chatroom identifier e.g. conversation identifier and or chatroom consumer identifier e.g. conversation user identifier . In typical embodiments only one user will have access to such a chatroom conversation thereby establishing the one to one communication between an enterprise data source and an end user.

In another illustrative embodiment a first message in a first plurality of messages is posted by the enterprise data source where the first message is a associated with an application programming interface key identifying the sub channel of the enterprise data source and b a first application programming interface token identifying the first user. Further a second message in the second plurality of messages is posted by the enterprise data source . The second message is associated with a the application programming interface key identifying the sub channel of the enterprise data source and b a second application programming interface token identifying a second user associated with a second remote user device. In this example the first application programming interface token and the application programming interface key are used to route the first message to the first remote user device within the sub channel . The second application programming interface token and the application programming interface key are used to route the second message to the second remote user device within the sub channel. Thus the first message is in a first conversation hosted by the sub channel and the second message is in a second conversation hosted by the sub channel.

In some embodiments messages posted on sub channels are encrypted at the originating device e.g. remote user device or enterprise data source using private information. For instance if the message is posted by the end user private information associated with the end user or the end user s remote device is used to encrypt the message. If the message is posted by the enterprise data source private information associated with the enterprise data source is used to encrypt the message.

Referring to in some embodiments a sub channel in a hierarchy of sub channels is associated with a sub channel identifier and an application programming interface key and a message in the plurality of messages is sent in the sub channel when the first user or the enterprise data source sending the respective message includes the sub channel identifier the application programming interface key and an API key. The API key serves to specify the access rights of the message originator.

In some embodiments each of the sub channels associated with a given enterprise data source is used to perform a different customer service task. For instance referring to one sub channel may be used to offer a service such as discovering best places another sub channel may be used to offer the latest buzz while still another sub channel may be used to offer new openings. 

Each such sub channel may host a number of conversations each conversation between the enterprise data source and a different end user. The enterprise data source is associated with e.g. participates in each of the conversations. Each conversation is with only a single user of a remote user device .

Referring to block of in some embodiments to ensure that each conversation in a plurality of conversations taking place on a single sub channel is secure that is only the intended user can see messages in a conversation the sub channel is associated with a sub channel identifier and the conversation within the sub channel is associated with an application programming interface key. A message is sent within posted to the conversation in the sub channel when the user associated with the remote user device or the enterprise data source that is associated with the sub channel sending the respective message includes the sub channel identifier the application programming interface key and an access token. The access token serves to identify the access rights of the message originator to the conversation.

Block provides just one example of the use of API keys and tokens. In some embodiments of the present disclosure API keys designate a number of operations available in the secure mobile communication platform including but not limited to defining an enterprise data source within the secure mobile communication platform defining each primary communication channel associated with the enterprise data source defining each sub channel associated with the enterprise data source connecting a user to a primary communication channel and so forth.

Each sub channel can be set up to access data in a manner that is independent of other sub channels. Thus referring to block in an example embodiment a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel makes use of a first database or other form of information such as an external system that accesses data associated with the corresponding enterprise data source . For instance this first database may be related to a payment system used by the enterprise data source to obtain payment for goods and or services provided to users. A second sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with the respective primary communication channel makes use of a second database or other form of information such as an external system that accesses data associated with the corresponding enterprise data source. The first database is other than the second database. For instance the second database may be related to a system used for tracking customer complaints or the shipment information for customer orders.

Sub channels support numerous chat rooms with each such chat room consisting of a conversation between an enterprise data source and a single user. That is each such conversation in a sub channel is between i the enterprise data source or a proxy for the enterprise data source and ii a single user associated with a remote user device . Messages placed in such conversations by the enterprise data source are delivered to the remote user device of the associated user who is typically allowed to consume the message only once. Advantageously in some embodiments the messages in a conversation in a sub channel are created by automated human interface modules associated with a sub channel. Such automated human interface modules parse messages and other responses by a user in a conversation and use this input to determine suitable reply messages to send to the user. When the automated human interface module is not able to parse the messages adequately the automated human interface module may refer the conversation to another automated human interface module or to the queue of a live operator of the sub channel.

Block of illustrates how this is accomplished in accordance with one embodiment. A first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective first primary communication channel in a plurality of primary communication channels hosts a first conversation between the enterprise data source corresponding to the first primary communication and a first user. The first conversation has a first human intervention status. When the first human intervention status is deemed automated messages in the first conversation from the remote user device associated with the first user are processed by a first automated human interface module. When the first human intervention status is deemed non automated messages in the first conversation from the remote user device associated with the first user are placed in a queue for processing by a human associated with the corresponding enterprise data source of the first sub channel .

In some embodiments a user input specifically triggers the change from automated to non automated. For example the user might say I want to talk with an operator and that might result in reclassifying further messages in the conversation such that they are routed to a non automated agent human call center rep e.g. . This routing could in principle change back and forth many times during a conversation between an automated agent the first human intervention status of the conversation is deemed automated and a non automated human agent the first human intervention status of the conversation is deemed non automated .

As noted above several conversations may concurrently be held on a sub channel of which only one is with a particular end user. The status of each of these conversations may be different. For instance consider the case where there are seven conversations concurrently being held on a given sub channel. In this example four of the conversations may be deemed automated and serviced by an automated human interface module whereas the remaining three may be deemed non automated and serviced by a human operator.

In some embodiments a trained classifier is used to monitor conversations on a sub channel for the purpose of changing the status of such conversations from automated to non automated. For instance such a trained classifier may parse the messages posted by users for certain keywords such as operator or other words or events that have been determined to be associated with a need for human intervention. For instance the user may have looped through several different nodes of an automated human interface module and may be getting frustrated. Advantageously in some embodiments classifiers are trained based on the broad aggregate of user interactions from a plurality of users over time.

Referring to block of in some embodiments when the first human intervention status of a first conversation is deemed to be automated the method further comprises applying messages on the first sub channel from the remote user device associated with the first user to a trained classifier associated with the first sub channel thereby obtaining a classifier result. When the classifier result falls into a predetermined category the first human intervention status is changed from automated to non automated until a predetermined event occurs. Referring to block this predetermined event may be for example a break in communications in the first conversation the elapsing of a predetermined amount of time or a manual switch of the first human intervention status from non automated to automated by a human operator associated with the corresponding enterprise data source. Referring to block in some such embodiments the classifier produces a binomial classification and the predetermined category is one of the two outputs of the classifier. Referring to block of in some such embodiments the classifier is a decision tree a random forest a Bayesian network a support vector machine a neural network or logistic regression. Referring to block in some embodiments the classifier is trained across the conversations of a plurality of sub channels using feedback data provided by the plurality of users regarding a plurality of their interactions with the server system using the sub channels. Referring to block examples of such interactions include electronic payment processing customer sign up and customer service by the plurality of users using the sub channels provided by the server system.

A first user may have one conversation in one sub channel with a first enterprise data source that is deemed automated while having another conversation in another sub channel with a second enterprise data source that is deemed non automated or vice versa. That is the status of each conversation is independent. Block of illustrates. A second conversation in a second sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a second primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels has a second human intervention status that is independent of the first human intervention status of the first conversation. When the second intervention status is deemed automated communication in the second conversation from the remote user device associated with the first user is processed by a second automated human interface module. When the second human intervention status is deemed non automated communication in the second conversation from the remote user device associated with the first user are placed in a second queue for processing by a human associated with the corresponding enterprise data source of the second sub channel.

Referring to block of a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel process a communication received from a remote user device associated with the first user in the conversation as a query for data by converting the query into a modified query in accordance with an application program interface function call triggered by the query received from the first user. In some embodiments the modified query is submitted to a database associated with electronically addressable by the corresponding enterprise data source . However the present disclosure is not so limited. In some embodiments the modified query is submitted to any electronic data source or system that retrieves electronic data and that has been designated for such purpose by the enterprise data source . This can be for instance a system that references files or is capable of addressing any kind of non transitory memory storage mechanism. This system may be owned or leased by the enterprise data source or may be in the public domain depending on the application. A query result is received from the data source responsive to submitting the modified query. In some embodiments this query request is reformatted. The reformatted query result is then communicated to the remote user device associated with the first user directly in line within the conversation between the enterprise data source and the remote user device . In one use case the client side communication module C invokes a first API call within a conversation. In response to this API call the communications module enterprise source side E receives the API call and makes another API call to a back end system associated with the corresponding enterprise data source and gets a result. The query result is processed into another format by the communications module enterprise source side E and this result is returned to the client side communication module C for display in the conversation.

Referring to block of in some embodiments the data source associated with the corresponding enterprise data source provides an inventory control mechanism for the enterprise data source and the query seeks information about an item tracked by the inventory control mechanism.

Referring to the disclosed secure mobile communication platform provides a plurality of automated human interface modules automated messaging bots and a system for managing and deploying these automated messaging bots. Each automated messaging bots reflects a defined message and or transaction capability. Automated messaging bots can contain a range of content and functionality from a simple static response to sophisticated knowledge systems that can power automated conversations leading to solutions and integrated transactions with external systems e.g. payments reservations etc. The secure mobile communication platform supports the generation of custom native intelligent automated messaging bots selection of automated messaging bots from third party platforms and defining flexible integrations of these automated messaging bots into automated messaging response networks.

Each automated messaging bots provides a certain scope and capability for automatically engaging end users in a conversational flow. Functional transactions can also be integrated into conversational exchange. The goal is for each automated messaging bot to help end users typically either resolve a question problem or to fulfill a specific transaction all via the disclosed messaging communications framework. An end user s conversation with an automated messaging bots is initiated when the initial message from the end user associated with a remote user device is assigned to the automated messaging bot . The automated messaging bot will initiate a response to the initial message based on its available logic. The end user s selection of available predefined responses or a typed message response are the triggers the bot uses to navigate the end user through it s available content logic node graph . If an automated messaging bot s exit criteria conditions are met the conversation either ends or is moved out of the bot and is either reassessed by the system moved to a live support message queue or reassigned to another automated messaging bot e.g. one that has a different logic flow and thus will provide a complementary orthogonal end user experience .

Some embodiments of the disclosed systems and methods provide the ability to create manage and administer bots to make them available for use in creating editing or deleting bots via a primary communication channel user interface by either using a user interface based automated message flow builder or by uploading VXML or properly formatted JSON files.

Some embodiments of the disclosed systems and methods provide a user interface based bot designer to assist in the creation and editing of the automated message flows within bots . Referring to in some embodiments this automated message flow is manifested as a node graph . The bot designer includes the ability to define the name of the automated message bot create edit and delete individual nodes in the bot the ability to expand collapse node branches the ability to see and edit the message content for a node e.g. stock messages stock widgets stock multimedia objects and the ability to see node traversals e.g. when one or more nodes connect to a different node .

In some embodiments a node of a bot reflects a predetermined decision point within the bot. The bot tries to evaluate an incoming message from a remote user device by parsing the incoming for recognized keywords and phrases. Based on detection of such keywords the automated human interface module will progress the end user in a particular direction within the node graph . Thus the use of nodes within a bot is similar to walking through a decision tree with different nodes in the bot where the bot knows the position of an end user in the decision tree and can progress the end user in the node graph . However the analogy to the decision tree here is merely exemplary. More generally nodes in the node graph embody a logic that can evaluate messages and based on this evaluation take some action such as send a message to the end user and or send the conversation associated with the end user to another node in the node graph of the bot the node graph of another bot or to the queue of a live operator e.g. the sub channel administrator depending on the end user message the choices made by the end user the user conversation history etc.

In some embodiments the automated human interface module designer further includes the ability to add edit and delete the end user s response options e.g. option buttons provided in a widget per node . Such response options include but are not limited to an ability to define a specific destination node for each end user option an ability to define a node option to close a chat session e.g. by user selecting the session closing problem is resolved option and in some embodiments with the system able to send a final response within the conversation such as Happy to help have a great day connecting to a different bot ability to move the end user to a different automated human interface module ability to select a specific destination node within the node graph of the bot ability to have the bot send multiple separate messages to the end user in the conversation in sequence for instance one right after the other near instantaneous ability to add change or delete an embedded third party widget e.g. payment transaction for a node ability to add change or delete a predefined system widget e.g. list picker for a list of service or production options date picker etc. a visual indicator for whether a node has any node tags associated with it. A tag is a single keyword or phrase and can be assigned by the enterprise data source .

Tags reflect a single keyword or phrase and can be assigned to specific nodes within a node graph of an automated human interface module and for the overall scope of the automated human interface module when an end user s conversation has been entered into the automated human interface module s automated message flow node graph .

In some embodiments the automated human interface module administrator interface based bot designer provides the ability to add edit and delete one or more node level tags the ability to add edit and delete one or more human interface module tags and scope tags and the ability to add a multimedia human interface module to one or more nodes in a node graph of an automated human interface module . As illustrated in each node tag is required to point to a specific node in the node graph of an automated human interface module . However as further illustrated in node tags can be grouped that is multiple node tags can all point to the same node in the node graph of an automated human interface module .

Primary communication channel administrators can configure one or more multimedia libraries by uploading objects such as images audio files movie files reference documents e.g. PDF files. Each object can optionally be tagged with one or more keywords or phrases. Each object can be assigned to a bot node as the bot s response to end user input. If the bot includes a reference to a multimedia human interface module discussed below any node response option can be configured to check for automated content from the multimedia content provided by the multimedia human interface module . There is provided the option to filter by media type and ability to specify specific tags or pass through the tag history associated with the end user responses from the current conversation e.g. the user conversation history .

In some embodiments a multimedia library is configured to behave like an automated reference system that is made available as a multimedia human interface module multimedia bot . The multimedia bot can operate at the sub channel level level as illustrated in parallel to various other bots assigned to the sub channel . For example a given sub channel may have five bots each such bot handling a set of conversations and further the given sub channel may have one or more multimedia bots that listen in on the conversations within the sub channel and provide multimedia objects to these conversations when there is a match between the tags to objects accessible to the multimedia bot and content in the conversations e.g. messages from the users associated with end user devices . In still other embodiments a multimedia bot may operate a widget at a particular node within an automated human interface module .

In some embodiments the multimedia human interface module is configured to be active for only dedicated requests from a bot node e.g. as specific nodes within the bot node and or custom message responses a user provides while interacting within a bot. In some embodiments a maximum response time for the message bot to provide a multimedia object to a query is specified. In some embodiments a default is provided. This is done to ensure that the multimedia object is provided within the right context in a conversation. For instance consider the case where the multimedia bot has detected the tag Los Angeles which is associated within the bot with a picture of Los Angeles. Posting of the image into the conversation in which the tag Los Angeles was detected is only appropriate within a certain period of time after the message containing the tag was posted into the conversation. Thus accordingly in some embodiments if the multimedia human interface module seek request takes longer than allowed the search will be abandoned. In some embodiments there is an option for defining how many tags from a user s current tag history found in the user conversation history for the user to include per search sequence by the multimedia human interface module .

Referring to in some embodiments the multimedia human interface module makes use of tags at two or three levels. Multimedia module scope tags provide one or more keywords or phrases that can be used as triggers when detected in messages from users in conversations for automated retrieval of multimedia content or at least activation of the multimedia module to perform a search. Each object e.g. media file to be made available as part of the multimedia module is tagged with one or more object tags . Further as illustrated in in some embodiments objects are arranged into directories . For instance each directory can represent a different product offered by the enterprise data source . Although illustrates a directory tree with one a single layer of sub directories in principle such directories can be nested to any desired level so that a directory may have sub directories which in turn may have sub directories and so forth which each level of sub directories having their own independent directory tags .

In some embodiments one or more of the following functionalities are included in the multimedia human interface module the ability to define specific content objects to be added to the object directory tree the ability to assign the content to an organizational branch directory in the object directory tree or a section of the branch and or the ability to enable disable parallel content channels by defining the inclusion of the multimedia human interface module into a node of an automated human interface module .

In some embodiments among the stock messages stock widgets and stock objects is content that represents an initial inquiry message that can be added to a conversation by the automated human interface module . For example Would you be interested in upgrading to the product version X Provides X better performance and you may qualify for a special offer Yes No . If the answer in the conversation from the user device associated with the user in the conversation is Yes the automated human interface module takes any of the following predetermined options in accordance with the node logic for the node that imposed this question a target node in the currently active automated human interface module and in the current conversation a target node in another active automated human interface module and in the current conversation or to a new conversation in another automated human interface module .

In some embodiments the enterprise data source can include advertising content among the stock messages stock widgets and stock objects of a node in an automated human interface module . This includes defined messages and or a media file link to a multimedia object a link to an external advertisement platform . Such a configuration can include getting the communications module enterprise source side E to send a list of tags or organized parameter mappings to such an external advertisement platform. In some such embodiments the communications module enterprise source side E would then make an application programming interface call and receive an advertisement image in response and post this ad image into the conversation. Included in such embodiments is the ability to define placement of the advertisements e.g. at what nodes in the node graph such advertisements are possible when they are to be presented what options are provided with such advertisements what advertisement responses are solicited from the user e.g. a menu of options like tell me more or dismiss and the ability to designate a dedicated advertising area in the user interface application provided by communication module client side C of . In some embodiments beyond the simple available organizational structure for media libraries illustrated in it is possible to create a specialized custom multimedia library reference bot containing a blend of conversational node logic as illustrated in with direct links to various multimedia files at specific nodes .

Setting up node graphs to direct user conversations within sub channel can involve some work particularly when more complex decision logic is desired. Advantageously one embodiment of the present disclosure provides for importing call center logic which is typically in VXML format. VXML is a digital document standard for specifying interactive media and voice dialogs between humans and computers. It is used for developing audio and voice response applications such as banking systems and automated customer service portals. In some embodiments an enterprise data source e.g. the enterprise data source super administrator the primary communication channel administrator the sub channel administrator can provide support flow data in VXML format and load that into the communications module enterprise source side E. In such embodiments the enterprise data source defines a name for the new imported automated human interface module . Further the enterprise data source either uploads a VXML file directly or copies and paste the VXML content into an entry field in the user interface provided by some embodiments the communications module enterprise source side E. Then the user clicks on a button e.g. Create to initiate the process that converts the VXML into an automated human interface module . In so doing the VXML file is parsed and VXML data is validated to ensure proper formatting. If the validation fails an error message identifying any validation issues is displayed. In some embodiments the data is converted into an automated human interface module specific JSON file format that represents the internal mapping organization and overall data structure for the automated human interface module including the node graph which embodies message flows hosted by the automated human interface module . The uploaded data can then be reviewed and edited in an automated message bot editor provided in some embodiments of the communications module enterprise source side E.

In some embodiments automated human interface modules are coded in a custom JSON structured data format that stores the bot s node graph message flow network . In some embodiments an enterprise data source is able to directly create native JSON files that can be uploaded into the communications module enterprise source side E. The process includes automatic validation of the format structure and specific parameter nomenclature. Validation issue notification alerts the enterprise data source to the problems the communications module E found.

The development time often required to generated logic that directs a conversation automatically and yet provides a user with a good customer experience can be extensive. Advantageously in some embodiments of the present disclosure the secure mobile communications platform provides an array of predefined default automated human interface module templates. Each template provides a node graph that contains placeholder content for an enterprise data source to customize for their purposes. In some embodiments available templates are presented in a Bot Store and can include automated human interface module and or multimedia human interface modules created by registered entities of the secure mobile communication platform e.g. registered enterprise data sources . Examples of such template automated human interface modules include but are not limited to different payment bots. For instance one sample payment bot could comprise a node graph that encodes a linear flow that leads a user in a conversation through a product service selection process payment transaction and ends with the receipt getting stored in the user s file storage. Another sample bot could comprise a node graph that simply provides basic store information such as location and office hours. The template customer would select a template from the list and then customize the necessary nodes in the node graph of the template with the business and specific content. In some embodiments the enterprise data source administrator has the option of following a step by step wizard to enter in the content for all the nodes in the node graph of the template module that require customized content or preferred widgets e.g. payment widget . In some such embodiments during this process a node graph network view will visually indicate all nodes that still require customization. In this view the enterprise data source administrator clicks on a node to edit it. Further the enterprise data source administrator can save an incompletely customized template. However in some embodiments template automated human interface modules and or multimedia human interface modules can only be activated for a sub channel if all required customization nodes have been updated.

In some embodiments templates for automated human interface modules are created with a template design module. In some embodiments a basic configuration option identifies the module as a template. The templates are defined by creating the underlying content and functional flow logic structure comprising the node graph . Any node in the node graph can be defined as a customization node and it is intended for the enterprise data source administrator to define the content for such nodes for their own use. For instance in some embodiments the enterprise data source administrator specifies a title and description help text for each customization node. This is to help the enterprise data source administrator with defining appropriate content for the node .

In some embodiments templates for automated human interface modules have a configuration option relating to distribution. In such embodiments this configuration option default setting is off can be enabled to make the template available to all enterprise data sources making use of the secure mobile communications platform . In some such embodiments where such bot templates can be distributed the bot template will require input for the following metadata i title name ii description purpose scope solution provided iii category e.g. select up to three from a predefined list and iv price can be defined as free .

In some embodiments the secure mobile communications platform enables third party bots to be used in the platform . In some embodiments two approaches are made available to select third party bots. First the secure mobile communications platform provides a web hook integration infrastructure that enables secure mobile communications platform customers to connect to third party bot platforms via the secure mobile communications platform developer interface . A specific third party bot is made available via such integration. Second generic customizable third party bots can be added as automated human interface modules to a store by a developer defining a third party web hook integration as available for distribution the Bot Store . In such embodiments the following metadata is provided with such third party bots i bot title name ii description purpose scope solution provided iii category e.g. select up to three from a predefined list and iv price can be defined as free .

In some embodiments any automated human interface module that has been created and enabled for a primary communication channel becomes available in the primary communication channel manager interface. Sub channel managers can select from any of the available modules as well as selecting specific widgets e.g. payment widgets multimedia library content etc. and deploy them as a response to a user s incoming message in a conversation . An end user who is entered into an automated human interface module will then be engaged by the automated human interface module s automated messaging conversation e.g. navigated though the node graph of the module until the automated human interface module exits the end user. An end user who is returned to the live person message queue e.g. the sub channel administrator queue will show up at the bottom of this queue.

In some embodiments and as illustrated in secure mobile communications platform administrators can select one or more available automated human interface modules and third party automated flow bots and assign them to one or more sub channels . In some such embodiments if a single automated human interface module is selected any end user messages sent through that sub channel is moved into the automated flow node graph of that module . If multiple automated human interface modules are assigned to a sub channel then an automatic automated human interface module assignment protocol is activated and all incoming messages are processed to send the end user to the most thematically appropriate automated human interface module .

In some embodiments there is provided the ability to enable disable automated human interface module assignments for a primary communication channel across all sub channels .

In some embodiments there is provided the ability to refine override primary communication channel based schedule at the sub channel level. In such embodiments for example sub channel A of a given primary communication channel may have different automated human interface modules activated than sub channel B of the given primary communication channel.

In some embodiments the enterprise data source administrator is given clear user interface indications as to whether automated human interface modules are active or inactive at a sub channel level.

In some embodiments there is provided an ability for secure mobile communications platform administrators e.g. enterprise data source super administrator primary communication channel administrator to define an automated human interface module activity schedule that can be edited at any time. In some embodiments sub channel administrators may review the schedule but cannot edit the schedule. In some embodiments sub channel administrators may review the schedule and edit the schedule.

In some embodiments the secure mobile communications platform provides the flexibility for integrating third party automatic message bots and mixing and matching the third party bots with secure mobile communications platform s native automated human interface modules into a sub channel by 

In some embodiments when two or more automated human interface modules are assigned to the same sub channel then the enterprise data source administrator is prompted to specify unique interface tag expressions e.g. exclusive keywords or phrases for each selected automated human interface module to each automated human interface module as illustrated in . Both native automated human interface modules and third party automated human interface modules are assigned interface tag expressions . Then when a new unassigned conversation is initiated on the sub channel by way of an incoming message from an end user the content of the end user s message is scanned for matches between this content and the interface tag expressions . In some embodiments when a match is found between an interface tag expressions of a particular automated human interface module in the sub channel the conversation is routed to that particular automated human interface module . In some embodiments the enterprise data source administrator has the ability to add edit and delete these interface tag expressions . Thus when an end user submits a message to the sub channel the system looks for any tag matches between the message content and the interface tag expressions defined for any of the automated human interface modules assigned to the sub channel. The conversation is moved into the best matching automated human interface module .

In some embodiments a default response mode is enabled for a sub channel . In such instances one of the automated human interface modules is designated as a default bot for the sub channel and represents the default bot to be selected in case no interface tag expression matches are found for any of the primary assigned automated human interface modules .

In some embodiments a sub channel exit module is provided. A primary purpose of this exit module is to reengage the automatic human interface module assignment anytime a user responds to a flow based message with a custom typed response that moves the user out of the automated human interface module they were inserted into and conversing with. In some such embodiments there is an associated configuration option to not allow the user to be reentered into the same automated human interface module they were just moved out of By default this option is enabled e.g. allowing the sub channel to reenter the user into the same automated human interface module they just exited. In some embodiments there is an added option to define an appropriate message for reinserting the user into the same automated human interface module for example Let s try rebooting your modem again. 

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a full automatic mode by which the sub channel operates. In such embodiments if the unattended mode is on all conversations that exited an automated human interface module will automatically be reassessed at the sub channel level using for instance the automatic human interface module assignment protocol described above in which the user conversation history is searched from matches to the interface tag expressions of participating automated human interface modules . If the conversation can t be matched to any assigned automated human interface modules in this manner the conversation is routed to the default automated human interface module which is intended to provide a prepared close to the conversation.

In some embodiments in scenarios where a user s incoming message fails all tag matches the system will assign the message either into the live chat support e.g. sub channel administrator queue of or the default automated human interface module in unattended mode by default. When session reassessment mode is enabled the system will instead automatically present the user with a message that asks the user to select from a list of options which are based on a to be selected list of interface tag expressions from any available automated human interface modules attached to the sub channel . For example assume there are two available automated human interface modules in the sub channel 

Tag assessment and matching is a central function leveraged by processes managing automated conversation flows. Tag matching involves matching words or phrases from messages from end users and a defined list of tags associated with nodes node tags or an automated human interface modules interface tag expressions . In some embodiments the following considerations are imposed when defining such tags interface tag expressions are not duplicated across multiple automated human interface modules assigned to the same sub channel . Further within an automated human interface module the scope tag expressions should be unique. Node tags within an automated human interface module can be duplicated across nodes . This is because node tags are assessed when a user replies to an automated set of options from a specific node with a custom message. So for example the tag Apple assigned as a node tag to two different nodes in the same node graph may only get evaluated for a given conversation when the conversation is at that node .

One tag matching process in accordance with the present disclosure is as follows. When there is a singular tag match within an asset e.g. the interface tag expressions of only one human interface module match a message in a conversation automatic selection occurs. When multiple tag matches within an asset e.g. an interface tag expression or node tags tags are evaluated in order of priority they are listed. Assume a message contains the following keywords apples oranges lemons . If the active node has the following tags and destination nodes associated with it 

then the match is for the node tag apples oranges and the conversation is moved to destination node A.

If at the sub channel level there are multiple equal tag matches across automated human interface modules the following heuristics are imposed in some embodiments. If an incoming message has multiple interface tag expression matches with several different automated human interface modules within the sub channel it may not be suitable to select an automated human interface module on this basis. In some embodiments the system will automatically respond back and challenge the end user to select a conversational topic by reflecting back individual choices reflecting each tag match. For example assume a message from an end user contains the following keywords apples oranges lemons and three automated human interface modules that each have separate interface tag expressions associated with them they can t have the same tags assigned 

In some embodiments system manages conversations to help track and identify the progress and process of each conversation and to be able to differentiate different conversations originating from a specific end user. In such embodiments the system tracks a conversation by i the active conversation identifier ii the process module identifier e.g. automated human interface module live chat with sub channel administrator etc. iii node identifier and or iv support representative e.g. sub channel administrator identifier live chat .

In some embodiments an initial incoming message from an end user ID does not contain a conversation identifier and is therefore automatically assigned a unique conversation identifier. In some embodiments the conversation identifier is specific to a user and sub channel combination.

In some embodiments the conversation identifier is closed when for instance the system identifies that the conversation has ended. That can be accomplished by a designated conversation closing node such that once conversation reaches this designed node the conversation ends. In some embodiments the designated conversation closing node may send a final message to the end user. In some embodiments the conversation closing node option specific ends a final conversation close question to the user. At least one node option if selected by the user would indicate that the conversation has ended e.g. Issue resolved Not resolved with the resolved option clearing the conversation. In some embodiments the conversation closing node is configured to send a final response to the end user e.g. Thank you Have a nice day before clearing the conversation identifier.

In some embodiments automated human interface module administrators could close a conversation by either i selecting and sending a predefined custom or system conversation close module which includes a defined closing message ii clicking on the close conversation button which ends the conversation e.g. after providing a customized response back to the end user providing a message such as Greg glad to be of assistance have fun at the SF Giants game on Saturday 

If the system sends a final response and the end user answers with a custom message e.g. not selecting either issue is resolved unresolved options in a menu then the conversation identifier is retained.

A conversation may cover multiple topics e.g. with the conversation moving from one module to another module . In such embodiments the conversation will retain the same conversation identifier.

When an automated human interface module can t resolve a conversation and needs to bounce a conversation out e.g. back up to the sub channel level the automated human interface module and node identifiers are cleared from the conversation but the conversation identifier is retained. For instance when the sub channel reassigns the conversation to another automated human interface module or to live chat the appropriate automated human interface module identifier or live chat identifier is added into the conversation.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide configuration options enabling enterprise data source administrators to define time based conversation closing rules e.g. if X hours days pass and or user closes application without the user sending a response the conversation is closed if conversation close type response was sent to the end user but the end user does not respond and either closes the application and or X hours pass the conversation is closed .

The default conversational flow in an automated human interface module moves a conversation through the node graph of nodes . Each node can contain multiple options for the end user to select. Each node option can move the conversation to a specific destination node in the automated human interface module s node graph . Multiple nodes can point to the same specific destination node . The node graph can therefore be comprised of complex branches of connected nodes. In some embodiments a node graph is a cyclic or acyclic graph with branches. Resulting conversation flows can jump from a node in one node branch to a different node branch in such graphs. It is also possible to move the conversation from a first node in a first module to a second node in a second module .

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide dynamic message assessment that can reroute user conversations within the automated human interface module . The native automated human interface modules can be configured to listen for keywords phrases of an entered message. In some embodiments the message is evaluated at up to four levels two which are within an automated human interface module .

Referring to node tags provide one or more keywords phrases that are added to a source node . Each of these tags is also assigned a destination node that the end user is moved to if the node tag is fired. For example assume that node A has three defined node tags e.g. node tag Apples node tag Oranges and node tag Kiwis . Each node tag would further be associated with a destination node e.g. node tag Apples connects to node B . When an end user initiates a custom response within a conversation after having arrived at node A then if his message contains Apples the conversation would continue at node B . The automated human interface module checks for node tag matches at the current node first. If there are no matches with the node tags of the current node the automated human interface module goes to the level 2 assessment described below.

Referring to one or more keywords phrases can be assigned at the automated human interface module scope as scope tag expressions . When the node tags at the current active node fails to match the end user message the end user message is compared to each of the scope tag expressions of the automated human interface module that is currently hosting the conversation. Each scope tag expression at the automated human interface module is assigned to a destination node in the node graph . Thus if a match is found with a particular scope tag expression and the end user message the conversation is progressed to the node referenced by the scope tag expression .

When the level 1 and level 2 tags fail to find a match e.g. the automated human interface module presently hosting the conversation within a sub channel the user is excited out of the current automated human interface module and moved back to the 1.1 automatic assignment protocol which then reassesses the message at the sub channel s assigned bot level. Thus the message is compared to the interface tag expressions level 3 of each of the automated human interface modules in the sub channel . In some embodiments this system behavior is automatically enabled whenever the sub channel primary communication channel s 1.1. Unattended Mode is on . In some embodiments there is a configuration option to disable sub channel level auto flow bot reassignment when the unattended Mode is off . When disabled conversations are automatically moved to the live support conversations e.g. the sub channel administrator queue of the sub channel after they exit an automated human interface module .

While it is possible to define a specific multimedia content lookup as part of the message content for an automated human interface module the inclusion of a multimedia human interface module in an automated human interface modules adds automated media file retrieval. When enabled the multimedia human interface module will attempt to follow the conversation from the automated human interface module . Referring to as the conversation proceeds to drill down into a specific topic the multimedia human interface module will define its scope for evaluating tag matches within the corresponding directory in its own organizational structure as long as there is a directory to drill into. If the conversation moves the user from one node to another the destination node will inherit the branch hierarchy in the form of a tag sequence that is passed to the destination node. This allows the multimedia human interface module to reset itself in its own organizational hierarchy. The inherited branch hierarchy represents a list of tags that in the view of the multimedia human interface module takes precedence over the actual conversation tag history. The multimedia human interface module will only evaluate tag matches for objects if it contains any files in its current conversation following in the new directory location.

The multimedia human interface module process can be invoked in two ways depending on configuration. In one approach it is invoked by defining any node response option to pass through multimedia human interface module . The multimedia human interface module will review the associated keywords from the node option and follow the automated human interface module s automated node response with an appropriate media file that will also be sent to the end user. In another approach by assessing the user s last custom message against the multimedia human interface module tags. The automated human interface module passes to the multimedia human interface module the user response any node tags and the tag history from the current the automated human interface module session in that order. The order of the tags reflects a matching preference with the first listed keywords receiving more weight. In some embodiments the multimedia human interface module looks for media file tag matches in the following order. First it checks user response and node tags against the tags and appropriate tags . If there are no matches to tags from the user node option custom message or node tags the multimedia human interface module will include a fixed number configurable of tag history tags for evaluation. If there is an inherited tag hierarchy it will take priority over the full conversation hierarchy. If there are no hits multimedia human interface module will pause. If multiple objects result in hits the object with the highest hit score total weight score of matching tags and is posted to the conversation or is passed to the automated human interface module for posting into the conversation.

In some embodiments there is layered within the multimedia library organizational hierarchy options to leverage upsell or advertisement content. These options can be enabled disabled on a per automated human interface module basis.

In some embodiments based on a primary communication channel configuration setting a maximum amount of time is allotted for the system to respond from within an automated human interface module . When that time is exceeded the user will be moved out of the automated human interface module . In some embodiments a reference search via the multimedia human interface module has its own time out limit. If a multimedia human interface module search times out the user is retained in the automated human interface module and it s conversation continues.

As a conversation or message interaction unfolds the system will aggregate a tag history e.g. referring to user conversation history for the user s conversations in a sub channel . In some embodiments the tag history structure will include i primary communication channel name and identifiers sub channel name and identifier end user identifier conversational method e.g. live interaction automated human interface module name and identifier sequence of messages the user provided user conversation history matching level 1 2 3 4 tags associated with any end user response and an active Y N flag reflecting whether the user is actively interacting .

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide reports that provide overview data about user sessions and provide summary data and statistics for various aggregation application scopes such as for the primary communication channel breakdown of data across sub channels and for sub channels breakdown of data across messaging channels e.g. automated human interface modules and live messaging with the sub channel administrator . For sub channels such reports provide a breakdown of data across nodes of each automated human interface module and the type of widget and live sessions also lists automated human interface modules and objects delivered by the multimedia human interface module . These reports provide for the ability to drill into the more detailed scope reports from the highest level e.g. the primary channel scope. For visual clarity in some embodiments these reports will present numbers in beside graphical indicators e.g. circles whose size and color depth reflects the size of the number to be displayed in comparison to all other numbers in the report . This allows the enterprise data source administrator to quickly look at the report and identify where the most end users are.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a real time dashboard indicating distribution of user data across the various scopes listed above such as number of live users with active message interactions number of inactive users with completed conversations in the past selectable date range and default periods total number of incoming messages average response time to messages initiated by end users average conversation interaction time average number of message exchanges before resolution or exit number and percent of positive resolutions by live messaging number and percent of positive resolutions by automated human interface modules and or number and percent of unresolved inquiries by automated human interface modules .

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a summary overview of how end users moved through the automated human interface module conversations. For example some embodiments present where and volume of end users entered the automated human interface module . Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a resolved path and exit report presentation of where with what volume end users exited the automated human interface module with the conversation unresolved . Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide an unresolved hot spot exit report presentation of where with what volume end users exited the automated human interface module with the conversation unresolved . This secure mobile communications platform hot spot report provides a clear indication of the automated human interface module s user exit performance. Some embodiments of the present disclosure feature clear indicators of any hot spots e.g. nodes in the automated human interface module where there is concentration of unresolved conversations that then exited the automated human interface module . Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a tag summary report for each node through which any end users exited the automated human interface module . The report provides a breakdown of the specific tags that resulted in the user s exit from the automated human interface module . For instance the tag report for a specific node may provide a volume based breakdown of the conversation tags associated with the exit messages this display may include volume word clouds and a table sorted by volume of tags or phrases. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide an automated report the system can automatically send a daily or weekly email update on sub channel and automated human interface module performance including a summary on automated human interface module exit performance and top hot spot nodes along with top tags. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provided differential reports showing changes in automated human interface module performance based on customizable time periods and also between saved automated human interface module updates.

In some embodiments automated human interface modules can be evolved in a number of ways to expand their capability and the range of topics they can cover via automated message interactions. One of the primary ways that enterprise data source administrators use this to improve the effectiveness of their automated human interface modules is to periodically check the primary channel reports which identify the hot spots in the automated human interface module messaging logic network and that reflect a primary opportunity to evaluate modifying expanding the automated human interface module in those specific nodes areas to expand the automated human interface module s ability to increase the success rate of completing conversations. Further the node tag report will provide very specific data about what end users are focused on with their response selections and custom messages at time of exit. By expanding the automated human interface module s capacity to automatically extend and resolve more conversations the efficiency of the automated messaging platform is increased.

Most organizations are eager to receive user feedback for their customer support services. Bot survey mode or Survey bots enables the communications module to extend a conversation session of one of the automated messaging bots described above so that answers to survey questions are directly connected to the conversation session scope of the automated messaging bot . At the same time the end user s interactions are managed and stored separate from the record of the conversation session ensuring that the survey bot question interactions are not stored as part of the actual conversation history of the conversation session survey questions are not reviewable by the end user and the survey question responses are not directly viewable by live support agents such as the sub channel administrators or the primary communication channel administrators .

In an exemplary embodiment at a server system comprising one or more processors and memory using a unique identifier received from a first user to obtain characteristic information from a user profile corresponding to the first user that is stored in one or more data stores the first user is joined to a plurality of pre existing primary communication channels based upon the user profile information for the first user. Each primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels facilitates electronic communication between a corresponding enterprise data source and a first remote user device associated with the first user. Each primary communication channel in the plurality of communication channels hosts a different plurality of users. The first user is joined for a first primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels associated with the first user to one or more pre existing sub channels associated with the first primary communication channel. A first message that is posted by the first user is received. The first message comprises a a key identifying a first sub channel in the one or more pre existing sub channels b a first application programming interface token identifying the first user and c a first communication. An example first communication is the text message I would like to see what is on sale today. Another example of the first communication is a selection of an affordance of a GUI presented to the first user which includes an affordance for Sales. Selection of this affordance e.g. radio button by the first user generates the first communication that indicates that the user would like to see what is on sale. Responsive to the first message a first automated human interface module engages in electronic conversation with the first user using the first sub channel . The first automated human interface module includes a node graph that directs one or more states of the electronic conversation. A second message that is posted by the first automated human interface module is received. The second message includes a a key identifying the first sub channel b the first application programming interface token identifying the first user and c a second communication responsive to the first communication. The first application programming interface token and the key included in the second message to route the second message to the first remote user device within the first sub channel thereby initiating a first secure bidirectional conversation between i the first remote user device associated with the first user and ii a first enterprise data source associated with the first primary communication channel.

In some embodiments the conversation with the first user is not with an automated human interface module but is rather between a sub channel administrator or primary communication channel administrator and an end user. In some embodiments the conversation with the first user begins with an automated human interface module but is later transferred to a sub channel administrator or primary communication channel administrator . In some embodiments a survey chat bot is engaged at the end of such a live conversation between a sub channel administrator or primary communication channel administrator and an end user at the end of a conversation with an automated messaging bot or is initiated by a live supporting agent such as a sub channel administrator or the primary communication channel administrators . In some embodiments a survey chat bot is engaged at the end of a conversation even in instances where no part of the conversation ever went live between a sub channel administrator or primary communication channel administrator and the first end user.

In some embodiments the survey chat bot is configurable within the communication module to work within a particular sub channel that is hosting multiple conversations within one or more automated messaging bots . In such embodiments the survey chat bot is set up so that when a conversation in the sub channel is marked as ended by a live agent e.g. a sub channel administrators or the primary communication channel administrators or the automated messaging bot itself the survey chat bot is automatically appended to the conversation in order to interact with the end user in order to conduct a survey associated with the survey chat bot. As an example in some embodiments all or a portion of a first secure bidirectional conversation is recorded into a first data structure and the first secure bidirectional conversation to is transferred to a survey automated human interface module at a conclusion of the first secure bidirectional conversation thereby initiating a survey of the first user by the survey automated human interface module. The survey of the first user is not recorded in the first data structure.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide automated messaging bots that have an automatic transfer to a default survey bot. That is the node graph of the automated messaging bot specifies a particular default survey bot that is to conduct a survey at the end of each conversation hosted by the respective automated messaging bot . In such embodiments end users are seamlessly transitioned to the first node in the survey chat bot.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure define a default survey bot on a sub channel basis. In such embodiments each respective conversation within the sub channel is automatically transitioned to the default survey chat bot after the respective conversation is closed by either a i live support agent e.g. sub channel administrators or the primary communication channel administrators or ii the corresponding automated messaging bot that is hosting the respective conversation . In such embodiments end users are seamlessly transitioned to the first node in the survey chat bot.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure define a default survey bot on a primary communication channel basis. In such embodiments each respective conversation in each sub channel within the primary communication channel is automatically transitioned to the default survey chat bot after the respective conversation is closed by either a i live support agent e.g. sub channel administrators or the primary communication channel administrators or ii the corresponding automated messaging bot that is hosting the respective conversation . In such embodiments end users are seamlessly transitioned to the first node in the survey chat bot.

In some embodiments a survey chat bot is fully customizable on a per sub channel or a per primary communication channel basis and can contain a multitude of nodes in the form of a node graph disclosed above for the automated messaging bot . That is in some embodiments all node types that are available for automated messaging bots are available for survey chat bots. As such in some embodiments the survey chat bot comprises a multitude of nodes within its node graph and these nodes are connected by edges.

In some embodiments a different survey chat bot is defined for each sub channel . In some embodiments a different survey chat bot is defined for each primary communication channel .

In some embodiments a survey chat bot facilitates the computation of a net promoter score for a conversation . A net promoter score is designed to represent how an end user feels about the enterprise data source that they engaged with in the conversation . For instance in some embodiments the net promoter score provides a measure of how the end user feels about the quality of customer support in the conversation . In some embodiments the survey chat bot asks the end user a single question in order to derive the net promoter score such as On a scale of one to ten how would you rate your experience with our support service with you today Based on what the user selects to a question such as this the net promoter score is computed. In some embodiments the computation of the net promoter score is more complex and multiple questions are posed to the end user by the survey chat bot. For instance in some embodiments the survey chat bot asks three or four questions and then computes the net promoter score using a predetermined formula based upon the responses to the three or four questions. In some embodiments the questions are nodes on a graph and which nodes and thus which questions are posed to the end user is determined by the end user s answers to earlier questions in the session with the survey chat bot.

In some embodiments the net promoter score is reported for a single conversation . In some embodiments the net promoter score is aggregated across all the conversations in which a particular sub channel administrator is engaged in a live conversation at some point within the overall conversation. In some embodiments the net promoter score is aggregated across all the conversations in a particular sub channel . In some embodiments the net promoter score is aggregated across all the conversations in all or a sub set of the sub channels associated with a primary communication channel . In some embodiments only those conversations that have completed within a predetermined period of time are used in such aggregation e.g. the past five minutes the past hour the past day the past week . In some embodiments those conversations that terminate or occur at particular times of the day e.g. business hours or the week work days versus holidays are aggregated. In some embodiments net promoter scores of conversations that have more recently been completed are given higher weight than conversations that were less recently completed in such aggregation.

In some embodiments for each survey chat bot a specific net promoter score survey question is defined. Data for the node hosting this survey question is automatically collected aggregated and presented back to the support center administrator e.g. the sub channel administrator . In some embodiments the net promoter score is automatically tracked for i each automated messaging bot conversation ii each live agent e.g. sub channel administrator conversation and or iii per automated messaging bot per day as well as historically as well as across all automated messaging bots within a sub channel and or in all or a subset of the sub channel in a primary communication channel . In some such embodiments a dedicated report is automatically generated covering all questions for each survey chat bot. In some such embodiments each report presents survey data in one of two formats depending on whether the survey question answers gathered integer numeric or character text based feedback. illustrates a sample aggregated report from a survey chat bot that collects numeric survey data. illustrates a sample aggregated report from a survey chat bot that collects text based feedback.

Referring now to the automated messaging bots as disclosed in in some embodiments each chat bot conversation is based on a dedicated chat bot instance. In some such embodiments the automated messaging bot provides a chat bot conversation self management and initiation feature that provides flexibility for chat bot conversations to be ended and initiated by automated messaging bots themselves. For instance consider the case where a given end user has initiated a conversation to order products. Historical data associated with the given user indicates that the user typically orders six products. Thus in this example the chat bot conversation self management and initiation feature would recall the cart from the last conversations the given end user participated in and pre populate the cart with the six products the user is likely to order. The end user can then remove or add items to pre populated cart and the pre populated cart represents a better initial state then requiring the user to add the six items the commonly order to the cart.

Thus in some embodiments an automated messaging bot provides the option of loading the details of a prior conversation that a particular end user engaged in. For instance the end user could have completed a particular transaction they were doing but it may still be helpful to have some or all of the details of the last transaction. Thus for some automated messaging bots for some types of transactions the historical data is automatically loaded. In alternative embodiments the end user is given the option to load the historical data from one or more prior conversations the particular end user engaged in. For instance in such alternative embodiments the end may say No it doesn t make sense to load the historical data. I have something completely different that I want to do. I m going to just you know I want to start without historical data. In another example the automated messaging bot offers to a particular end user We have historical data for you that indicate that you engaged with us the following five times in the past two months. Would it be helpful to load the selections you made in any of these transactions to more streamline the current transaction Responsive to this the end user may pick not just the last transaction but maybe they would say Oh you know the transaction from three weeks ago is the one I would like to start with. 

In still another example of the self management and initiation feature for an automated messaging bot that directs a user through a set of steps in each conversation . In this example the automated messaging bot loads the prior conversation associated with the given end user and provides a summary of the conversation to the effect Okay. This is what you did the last time at each of these six steps would you like to change your response to any of the steps The user can then navigate through the historical information making any necessary changes before proceeding. In this way the user does not have to enter in all the information for each of the six steps each time they engage in an instance of a conversation in order to perform a repetitive or partially repetitive transaction. Instead the end user goes through selecting the nodes or aspects that need to be changed rather than entering all new information. The automated messaging bot takes the end user to each node and the user modifies their selection. In some such embodiments after making their selections at each of the relevant nodes the end user gets an updated summary of their selections that they review again and once they are satisfied with their selections indicate to the automated messaging bot that all the entered information is correct. In this way a conversation for an automated messaging bot that has an arbitrary number of steps each requiring end user input can be executed by making a minimum number of changes if any and advantageously the end user is able to now complete the order or whatever the process is associated with the automated messaging bot and encoded by the automated messaging bot s node graph in a streamlined experience.

A chat bot can thereby end its own chat bot instance and thereby end the conversation and at the same time initialize a process to instantiate a new chat bot instance and seamlessly initiate a new conversation for the end user in a different bot within the stream s Pypebot framework extended bot graph .

Advantageously in some embodiments automated messaging bots include a number of initialization options. One such option is to load historical data such as data from a recent chat session conversation with an automated messaging bot and the present end user that operated in the same sub channel as the newly initialized automated messaging bot . In this way during invocation of the automated messaging bot or the initialization of a new conversation with the bot historical data may be loaded such as data from a recent chat session with an automated messaging bot and the present end user that operated in any sub channel under the same primary communication channel as the newly initialized automated messaging bot . When automated messaging bot invocation is enabled in this way data from the user s last chat session with such an automated messaging bot can be automatically preloaded into a summary node of the chat bot session hosted by the automated messaging bot or any of the nodes of the automated messaging bot . For instance the data can be seeded into appropriate nodes of the automated messaging bot .

Moreover beyond just initialization of a bot or the initialization of a conversation hosted by a bot the use of the summary node can significantly reduce the interactions a user needs to have with the automated messaging bot to complete their intended transaction s . For instance consider the case where the automated messaging bot is asking a series of questions within a conversation that it needs all the answers to in order to be able to complete a particular interaction or business transaction. Before finalizing the transaction the automated messaging bot may say Okay. We have spent the last X amount of minutes answering questions. Here is what I have. Here is what I m going to submit. Please take a quick look to see if there is anything you want to change. In this way the summary node is used to bring in historical data. As noted here the summary node may be used to bring in historical data from within the same chat session or from a prior chat session. The summary node may be used when a bot initializes a new conversation or any time during the conversation .

In some embodiments a number of automated messaging bot configuration options are provided. One such option is default which indicates whether historical chat data should be loaded by default. When this option is invoked historical chat data e.g. from the same sub channel with the same user is loaded by default by the automated messaging bot . Another such option is that historical chat data is loaded by user choice. For instance when a data inclusion user choice option is invoked the automated messaging bot asks the active user whether the most recent historical data associated with the active user in the sub channel should be loaded. As another example when a historical chat session selection option is invoked the active user is asked to select a specific historical chat session by e.g. date time from which the data should be referenced. This option enables the active user to select and have the automated messaging bot load the historical data set that is most similar to the user s current needs.

In some embodiments as referenced above one of the nodes of an automated messaging bot is a summary node. When the automated messaging bot has historical data for a series of connected nodes in the node graph of the bot the bot can present a summary of the user s data in one message. This enables the bot to display the available data to the user. This saves the user the time to respond to each question. As an example the bot may say Here is what I have based on the historical data we loaded for you and all the information is accounted for except for two missing items. So the user would fill those in or if everything s complete like I mentioned earlier then the user might select a specific items to say Okay. I just want to change out of these ten items I want to change number two and number seven. And then they d go ahead and do that get an updated summary and if they re all good right they d say Okay. I m good to go. Let s process this transaction. Thus when an automated messaging bot requires one or two data points it would present the user with those nodes and then present the summary node message. Through the summary node edit process the user can efficiently edit only those data points that are applicable for that particular session and leverage the remaining data from a previous conversation . As such an embodiment of the systems and methods of the present disclosure provides a summary node edit process in which the user can select and change a response to a specific node and will then immediately be presented with an updated version of the summary node. The user may elect to edit specific additional node data. In some embodiments direct return boomerang node edges are present in the node graph . This edge type in the node graph enables the summary node to navigate the user to the appropriate selected node in the bot . After the user interacts with that node the user is immediately returned back to the summary node bypassing any standard node flow sequence from that node. For instance if the user was in the summary node and indicated that a desire to change one thing the bot presents a second node that enables the user to make this change. However because the user so was brought over to the second node as part of a special process along a boomerang edge the user is then actually sent back to the summary node as opposed to the node or nodes that second node normally progresses to upon node completion. As such it will be appreciated that the plurality of edges of a bot define an ordered sequence in which nodes in the plurality of nodes of the bot are invoked and the instructions to edit the summary information drives a secure bidirectional conversation associated with the bot outside of the ordered sequence.

The defined start node bot instantiation enables a bot or live agent to trigger the initialization of a new bot instance e.g. a conversation hosted by the bot instance and also define the exact starting point e.g. node of the new conversation within the bot. Without this option any new bot framework instance starts at a default bot specific starting point which is typically to await and then evaluate initial end user input and then send the user to the most appropriate bot. Since there are many use cases where it is preferable or necessary to start a new bot conversation at a pre defined node within the bot the start node can be specified as part of the bot instantiation request function in accordance with the systems and methods of the present disclosure. The bot may thereby for example present the user with an initial message and options to select from that are accurately relevant to the topic task the user is interested in. If that information is already available prior to the instantiation of the bot leveraging that knowledge will yield a better user experience. As such in some embodiments a first communication initiating a conversation from an end user is evaluated prior to the bot responding with a second message to select an initial node in the plurality of nodes of the bot based upon the content of the first communication. This selected initial node is then used by the bot to generate the second responsive communication.

One use case example for the above described defined start node bot instantiation is a survey bot. In this use case the end user has completed a conversation e.g. it has been closed by either a chat bot or a live agent . In this use case the end user is presented with a survey e.g. transitioned to a survey bot. The user completes the survey and is then presented with a multitude of options including optionally the opportunity to initiate a new conversation in the same or a different bot. Thus consider the case in which the user is in an existing conversation with a bot and the conversation is reaching an end point. For instance a transaction within the conversation has been completed. Instead of the bot just signing off and saying Okay. The conversation s ended the first bot hosting the transaction itself or via transfer to a survey bot can make use of the defined start node bot instantiation feature to provide the user with options for further transactions associated with the enterprise data source . For instance the bot may say the bot can provide one or more survey questions such as Is there something we can help you in the technology department or would you like to make an appointment now Thus the answer to this question can lead to one of two specific starting nodes in a new conversation. Indeed the answer to the question can lead to the instantiation of different types of bots initiated at particular nodes. Thus in accordance with this example upon conclusion of a first secure bidirectional conversation with a first automated human interface module bot an end user is subjected to a survey within the sub channel that was hosting the first secure bidirectional conversation. In this way a survey result is obtained within the first sub channel based upon one or more responses of the end user to the survey. The survey results are evaluated to select an initial node in a plurality of nodes of another automated human interface module bot based upon the survey result. This initial node is used by the second automated human interface module to initiate a second secure bidirectional conversation between the remote user device associated with the end user and the enterprise data source associated with a primary communication channel that includes the sub channel.

Another use case example for the define start node bot instantiation is facilitating and streamlining multiple orders tasks. For instance at the end of a particular transaction a bot may say Okay. Well is there something else I can help you with For instance the user may have successfully completed their first task of e.g. changing the flight time for a trip on the same day. The user now wishes to complete a booking for a different trip. By using the define start node bot instantiation the bot is able to pass on information so that when the new bot gets initialized the bot can be smart and proactive enough to say to the user Okay. We ve completed the last session in which you indicated that you actually want to make this reservation now we re going to allow you to do that at this time. In this way the reservation is treated as a separate ticket. As an alternative to this for a particular end user the bot supports the ability to trigger a new conversation and at the end of a transaction presents the user with an affordance. If the user selects the affordance the bot will either initiate a survey bot or jump to a survey node within its own node graph. In either case the end user is presented with the message such as Can I help you with anything else when the affordance is selected. Thus the current bot instance e.g. the conversation hosted by the current bot plans to shut down but the bot knows the user clicked on the affordance e.g. button . So as soon as the current bot instance shuts down e.g. the current conversation is terminated the bot initiates a new bot instance and instead of the user just typing in the standard introductory requested information specified by the node graph of the new bot the new bot because of the additional information from the last bot instance by way of the defined state node bot instantiation will initiate at a very specific node in the bot node graph. For instance the bot may say Okay. You ve finished a prior transaction. We are starting a new transaction here and because of the information you had previously provided we are starting you right off here. Advantageously the end user does not have to worry about the separate ticket numbers for the two conversations or whether the bot hand off occurs. However from an overall tracking perspective the defined start node bot instantiation feature provides the flexibility to allow end user to spin up or spin down bot instances e.g. conversations and jump to specific nodes within these instances. Moreover the bot instances that are spun up initiated based on a prior bot instance can be in a different category than the original bot. Thus in some embodiments upon conclusion of a first secure bidirectional conversation with a first bot an initial node in a plurality of nodes of a second automated human interface module bot is selected based upon an end state of the first secure bidirectional conversation. This initial node is used by the second bot to initiate a second secure bidirectional conversation between i a first remote user device associated with the first user and the enterprise data source associated with a primary communication channel that includes the sub channel.

As another example consider the case where there is an overall bot platform and one bot handles reservations. The way a reservation is normally handled is the user opens up their application and types I d like to make a reservation to which the response Where would you like to go is provided. But in some cases where the user has already made a reservation the user is given options to say Okay. Are we all done Would you like to make another reservation If the user clicks on Make Another Reservation and if the enterprise data source wants to execute this as a separate conversation and transaction instead of just moving the user back to a certain node in the existing bot instance the enterprise data source may desire that the current conversation be closed in favor of a new ticket bot instance. Then because it is known that the user wants to make a new reservation the user is moved to a very specific node within the new bot instance to start a process of making the new reservation.

Still another use case example for the define start node bot instantiation is live agent e.g. sub channel administrator to chat bot conversation transfer. This is the ability for agents to transfer a conversation to a chat bot. The primary scenario is for an agent to select a specific available chat bot and typically an accessible target entry node within the selected bot.

Thus consider the case in which there is a conversation between a user and a bot and the bot moves the user you to a live agent. Thus the user talks to the live agent and at some point in this live the conversation they complete whatever issue there was and resolve it. It that time the live agent determines that a remaining issue the user has is easily handled by a bot. In accordance with an embodiment of the systems and methods of the present disclosure the agent is able to pass the conversation back into a bot. But instead of just always moving the user to the top of the node graph of the bot where the bot queries the user for basic information all over again that is the bot doesn t know anything and or is just waiting for the user to make an input by typing an initial message the conversation is moved to a very specific node in the bot. So then as soon as the transition happens from the live agent to the bot the conversation is moved into a specific node. Because of this for example the bot may immediately say Oh okay. I can help you make that reservation and here is the information I need. This advantageously provides a much more seamless transition that enables the bot to move a conversation to a very specific node where the bot immediately provides the user with a comment or asks a specific question for the user that advances the transaction from the point the live agent intended.

The process requires the bot initialization function. It also depends on the ability to specify the target node within the node graph of the chat bot which allows a bot to initiate the conversation with the end user as part of the transfer. Since the agent knows what the user is looking for it is appropriate for the bot to begin the conversation at the right point e.g. at the right node in the node graph of the automated human interface module without the user having to restate the question for the bot. This use case scenario is beneficial because it allows agents to offload conversations that may have initially required live agent support but have transitioned back to a standard workflow. This use case scenario is also beneficial because it allows the live agent to upon identifying a common scenario initiate a transfer to a chatbot. This use case scenario is also beneficial in situations where the initial live support case is successfully concluded and the user has an additional request one that can be readily handled by a chat bot.

Bots are designed to be able to pull information from external data systems. This may be done by any of a number of standard methods such as API calls. Thus under normal circumstances a bot gets to a certain node in its node graph . The bot has enough information to make an authenticated call to an external system in order to pull information in for a specific user . However sometimes the external system may be down when this call is made. Accordingly in some embodiments each automated human interface module includes a core multilevel exception handling protocol to handle such situations. For instance if the bot finds a conversation it is hosting to be in an exception state such as the above illustrated case where an external system completely failed to respond to a call as opposed to instance where the external system properly responded to the call with null results because there was nothing that match the query made by the bot in the call to the external system the bot recognizes the occurrence of the exception state and transitions the conversation to an exception handling node within the bot s node graph . In some embodiments this exception handling node is customizable by the enterprise data source of the associated primary communication channel hosting the bot so that the enterprise data source has control over the look and feel of such exceptions. For instance in some embodiments options are provided to the enterprise data source to customize some of the wording and some of the options that they want to make available when an exception arises. In some embodiments such options include whether to move the conversation to a live agent. In some embodiments such options include notifying the user that this part of the bot doesn t work and providing the user with a help menu or suggesting to the user that they try a different transaction.

As such in some embodiments the systems and methods of the present disclosure provides bots that include what is termed here to be level three exception handling. Level three exception handling is a data exchange failure with an external system. As discussed above many bots interact with external data stores by way of for example APIs. The bot external data exchange exception handling process is aware of when a bot instance is awaiting a response to for example an API request. If there is no response or the server responds with an HTTP error code the bot understands the issue and initiates an appropriate protocol that retrieves the error code and then moves that information to a customizable exception handling node within its own node graph or terminates the conversation and initiates another specific bot an exception handling bot to handle the error. The exception handling node or bot can be customized to provide the user with a predetermined type of response including the most appropriate alternative next steps the user can take. As such level three bot exception handling supports any number of similar failure types external API call failures being just one example. Another example is the failure of a feature extending plugin.

In some embodiments the systems and methods of the present disclosure provide bots that include what is termed here level two exception handling. Level two exception handling is a bot conversation failure. In such embodiments the communications module and or the bot provides a background monitoring process that provides a continuous assessment of each bot conversation . This allows the bot to be aware if it becomes stuck on some process e.g. at some node for instance due to a design flaw or any event that results in unexpected behavior resulting in the bot becoming unresponsive. In some embodiments the bot platform e.g. communications module can be configured to define the allowable latency. Once the latency period is reached the core of the bot exits the bot out of its current holding state and moves the conversation to the exception handling node.

As an example consider the case in which a bot is constructed to make some calculations and while making these calculations there is an exception. The bot has received information that it in the end can t compute. Typically this is the result of some king of design oversight in terms of how the bot is designed. Perhaps as a result of this design flaw the bot is stuck in some form of logic loop or did not put in place enough control over the data input e.g. where the user is provided three input options and the bot just accepts the option and then later tries to aggregate the information but the inputted information is out of bounds or out of scope. For instance the bot should have told the Oh I can only accept a number between one and ten. but for some reason the bot designer didn t put validation parameters around the input and allowed the user to put a number that is out of range such that later calculations by the bot fail. Level 2 exceptions define what happens when these types of bot failures arise. Typically the exception is processed by routing the conversation to the level two exception handling node or ending the conversation and routing the user to a level two exception handling bot that will provide an appropriate message back to the end user.

Another example of a level two exception is as simple as the input was a telephone number dashes are not allowed but the user wasn t told that. So the user put dashes in. The bot does not tell the user there shouldn t be dashes and then a little bit later on the bot is trying to do something with the phone number like run the comparison or some kind of check. Then with the unexpected dashes the script fails and gets stuck.

In some embodiments the systems and methods of the present disclosure provide bots that include what is termed here level one exception handling. Level one exception handling is for exceptions arising from the platform itself. For example consider the case where a new message comes in. By default what is supposed to happen is that the bot communications module is supposed to wake up. That is there is supposed to be an instantiation of a chat bot . But suppose there is no response. For instance the communications module is signaling there is a message coming in and nothing happens. That is no bot acknowledges to the communications module that it will handle the new message. So in that case a level 1 exception is thrown outside of the bot platform itself. That is the system needs to be smart enough to understand there is a problem and to send the user a message that indicates the bot platform is not available or something to that effect and then automatically move the conversation to a live agent.

In some embodiments the bots are served from a source e.g. server server farm virtual machine that is separate and apart from bot platform hosting the enterprise source side communications module . At the communications module when a message from a user comes in within a particular sub channel the module is configured to know that for this particular communication in this particular sub channel that there are certain bots that such messages should be routed through. That is such messages are to be routed to a bot first instead of going directly to a live agent. So the communications module will try to initialize a conversation with an appropriate bot responsive to the message. This is done be sending instructions within the appropriate sub channel for the bot . If the communications module does not get an acknowledgement from a bot in response to the instruction then the communications module will throw the level 1 exception. As a result of the level 1 exception the communications module may for example send the user a message that lets them know that the automated service is offline but that they are going to be transferred to a queue for a live agent. Thus when a level one bot platform failure is detected a process external to the bot framework triggers a process that enables the platform to inform the user that the platform is currently not available. The exception handling node bot could be setup to automatically make a connection with a live agent the primary alternative. Moreover alert notifications can be triggered to be sent out to external channels.

In some embodiments when a bot is implemented the required last step to activate the bot is to compile it. The compiler has two primary purposes. First to provide an efficient definition output file. In some embodiments the compiler creates the finalized bot definition file in an efficient JSON format. This output file is similar to the instructions information contained in a complete DNA sequence of a living organism in that it contains all the instructions to instantiate a bot and run any number of bot sessions each hosting a conversation . The second primary purpose of compilation is to provide intrinsic bot capabilities. The compiler contains a set of core bot blueprint instructions that define core intrinsic bot behavior. It is a set of processes that are included in the structure of every bot. This set of instructions defines the essence of bots as it governs the core bot capabilities and rules by which they operate. This allows for the efficient continuous expansion and evolution of the bot framework and operating system. illustrates an example bot definition file that is compiled into a bot .

In some embodiments the bot compiler creates a final output file for a bot . As part of this compilation process the compiler makes sure that there are certain core elements to the bot and that the output file that meets specific requirements. In this way any time a bot design is updated the bot has to go through the compilation process because that compilation process produces the end output file that is needed by the actual bot platform that runs the bots. Once a bot is compiled which only happens once to produce an output file the output file is stored on the secure mobile communication platform server or on a server computer that is securely addressable by the communication platform server . When a new message comes in the overall messaging framework calls out to the bot framework to alert the framework that a new message has arrived. In response the bot framework spins up a new bot instance by reading from the very bot file that contains all the information that is needed for the bot to behave properly. In this way a very efficient way to spin up an instance of a bot is provided in response to a new incoming message that when parsed triggers the beginning of a new conversation. The compilation process performs the time consuming tasks such as automatically expanding keyword tags and phrases for all the entry nodes making sure that the node graph has got all the proper connections and similar tasks. So it is acceptable that the compilation process to take a little bit of time. The compilation process results in an efficient output file that is perfectly suited to spin up instances of bots very efficiently and quickly responsive to incoming new messages that signify the request for new conversations .

In some embodiments the core bot definition comprises an automated node tag phrase pluralization and lemmatization. Compilation automatically extends the tags and phrases used for the NLP matching algorithm for every node in the graph.

In some embodiments the core bot definition includes a statistics node which is a central node that captures all aspects of each conversation session and saves it to chat session metric logs. Exemplary session metric logs include but are not limited to active chat duration in which the bot framework tracks both overall chat session conversation duration and the active interaction time. The overall chat duration tracks the time between the beginning and end of the chat session. The active chat duration is derived from removing all pause segments during which the user is unresponsive for more than a pre configured active period of time e.g. 30 seconds or 1 minute. The active chat duration thereby accounts for typical chat conversations which may naturally involve breaks in the conversation e.g. if the user is temporarily otherwise engaged e.g. incoming phone call or peer to peer chat . Combined with the overall chat duration the active chat duration metric thereby provides a clear picture of the actual amount of time end users interact with a bot.

In some embodiments the core bot definition includes an exception handling node which is the node through which all bot internal exception communication described above flows.

In some embodiments the core bot definition includes a conversation re routing jump node which is a base node through which all unexpected free form user input flows as described in more detail below.

In some embodiments the core bot definition includes a disambiguation node. This is the base node that receives and processes multiple node matches based on natural language processing evaluation of the end user s message. When a bot expects free form input from a user the user s message is evaluated for the most appropriate node matches across the entire graph. When the matching algorithm determines that one or more matches have relatively equal matching scores the chat bot protocol via the disambiguation node responds back to the user inviting the user to select from the available interpretations and their associated matches across bots. Example disambiguation chat exchange is 

In some embodiments the core bot definition includes a configurable node match inclusion range which is the range of scores considered for node match inclusion and can be configured per primary communication channel or by sub channel e.g. a tighter range may deliver better performance for one channel or sub channel whereas in another a broader range may serve better.

In some embodiments the core bot definition includes support for sensitive data nodes. In such embodiments any node in a node graph of a bot can be defined to contain and thereby operate as a sensitive data node. This configuration setting can be applied to a single node a subset or all nodes. In sensitive data mode data associated with the node e.g. obtained from the user by the node is stored as masked data. That is any data provided or selected by the user is stored in masked characters e.g. a social security number is stored as . In sensitive data mode chat history contains masked data since sensitive data is stored masked by the bot platform it thereby appears masked in the conversation s chat history. Any device used for a conversation will always display any sensitive data as masked in the chat stream. For example 

This ensures that sensitive data will not become a security risk if for example the device is lost or stolen. All sensitive data will be masked unreadable. Live support agents are also not able to read any sensitive data in the chat history of conversations between end users and chat bots. The sensitive data will be masked out. Accordingly one embodiment of the systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a first node in a node graph of a bot that is a sensitive data node and a second node in the node graph of the bot that is a non sensitive data node. At some point in a conversation hosted by the bot is passed to the non sensitive data node. While the non sensitive data node is hosting the conversation it receives a first set of communications one or more communications from the first user as part of the conversation. The non sensitive data node stores the first set of communications from the first user that have been processed by the non sensitive data node in a chat history unique to this conversation. At some point in the conversation hosted by the bot the conversation is passed to the sensitive data node. While the sensitive data node is hosting the conversation it receives a second set of communications one or more communications from the first user as part of the conversation. The non sensitive data node processes the second set of communications from the first user but does not store them in the chat history. Moreover it masks the second set of communications on a display of a device used by the end user to facilitate the conversation.

The reason sensitive data is often required is to ensure user authentication or provide required input parameters to complete application program interface requests to external systems. For these use cases the sensitive data needs to be available in unmasked format. Sensitive data is therefore stored in an active chat bot s session memory. The data only persists as long as the chat session and is secured via standard security protocols. As soon as a chat bot s instance is closed for example the conversation is over all sensitive and non sensitive data are immediately flushed from session memory.

Some embodiments of the systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a jump node and a jump destination bot. This provides a core user interaction support to respond to unexpected free form user input. Without the ability to a recognize free form user input and b the ability to appropriately process and respond to the free form user input a bot could become unresponsive for instance always forcing the user to make a pre defined selection or automatically restarting a conversation. The jump node and associated jump destination bot provides both a core process and a flexible way for a bot to respond to such an event. The basic tenet of the bot jump process is to ensure the conversation does not become suspended stuck when a user enters a free form message. Whenever a free form user entry is detected in a conversation the jump protocol is activated and the conversation is moved out of the basic conversational plane and into a parallel level above the bot s entire graph which is essentially where the core jump node resides.

Thus the jump node is used in the specific use case scenario where the bot has been enabled to present the user with an option to provide free form input as opposed to selecting button options or the like from a list picker. If the user provides input in such situations that is a non sequitur for the current place where the conversation is in the node graph in that scenario the jump node is invoked. So when triggered by seemingly unresponsive user input given the location in the node graph that the conversation is in the jump node is invoked to perform a natural language processing on the user input in which the question is asked as to what kind of matches can be obtained to the user input. In typical embodiments the jump node looks for a match at all available level labels e.g. node tags in the current node graph node scope tag expressions and interface tag expressions . In some embodiments the jump node looks for a match against all node tags of all nodes of all sub channels associated with a given primary communication channel . The end result of the action of the jump node is that either there are zero matches e.g. the bot cannot adequately parse the user s message by finding a matching label within any of the sub channels of the primary communication channel there is one node match or there are multiple node matches.

The jump node works by capturing what the user typed in. The jump node assumes that the user needs to be lifted out of the current plane of the conversation at least temporarily. In other words that the position in the node graph of the conversation is presently not significant given the user s unstructured input. The jump node looks for matching tags e.g. node tags scope tags or interface tags and then pushes these matches to a jump node destination bot. The jump node destination bot separate bot in the overall bot framework associated with a given primary communication channel .

Thus in accordance with some embodiments of the systems and methods of the present disclosure each node in a plurality of nodes of a first bot is associated with a different plurality of tags. A first node in the node graph for this first bot is a jump node. A message is received in a first conversation hosted by the first bot that includes a a key identifying a first sub channel b a first application programming interface token identifying and end user and c a communication where the communication is free form input from the end user. The jump node executes a process that evaluates the communication against each tag in each different plurality of tags associated with a node in the plurality of nodes thereby obtaining zero or more tags that match the communication. The first bot is suspended and the first conversation is moved along with the matching tags to a second bot automated human interface module . This second bot is dedicated to servicing conversations transferred from jump nodes of other bots. In some such embodiments the first bot is in a plurality of bots and each respective bot in the plurality of bots includes a corresponding node graph. Further each corresponding node graph comprises a plurality of nodes and a plurality of edges and each node in each plurality of nodes is associated with a different plurality of tags. In such embodiments the evaluating the communication evaluates the communication against each tag in each different plurality of tags associated with a node in each plurality of nodes thereby obtaining zero or more tags that match the communication. For instance referring to the evaluating may evaluate the communication against the tags of the nodes of two or more bots three or more bots or the tags of two or more sub channels .

In some embodiments the behavior of the jump node destination bot can be configured depending on the desire of the particular enterprise data source customer . For instance a particular enterprise data source may want to have the jump node destination bot query the user to confirm that before moving the user to a matching node of a matching bot whether they want to complete their current transaction. In such instance the jump node destination bot may be configured to say Before I move you to a new conversation area we were talking about something else. Do you want to complete that conversation first or would you like me to move me to one of those matching conversation areas right now. Do you want to go to a help menu In this way the jump node destination bot provides the user with whatever actions the particular enterprise data source wants to present the user in that use case and the user can make that choice now. For instance in the above example the user could say Okay. Yes. I actually do want to transition my conversation to one of those other topics of conversation. Or they could say Well okay. You know what I realize that I m now side tracking what I had before. Let me finish that. And so they could go back to the conversation that they were just having with the original bot that detected the non sequitur from the end user and complete that before going on to the next topic.

The jump node is considered to be part of the originating bot. In typical embodiments the jump node has a connection to each node within the bot node graph where unstructured input from the user may arise. As such the overall process for jumping the conversation is actually a two step process. The first step is being able to capture the scenario where the user is typing in a custom message when the bot is not expecting it and being able to handle that properly. The initial jump node looks for matches for topics that it could move the conversation to if the user wants to accept it. But then the jump node destination bot receives the information the matches that it gets from the jump node. The jump node destination bot typically has some logic that can be fully customized for a particular enterprise data source in terms of how the enterprise data source wants to handle the jump. In some instances there will be some basic things that the jump node destination bot typically will do. In some instances if there are no matches the enterprise data source may specify that the jump node destination bot will only allow the user to go back to where they originated. In some instances if there are no matches the enterprise data source may specify that the jump node destination bot will allow the user the choice of going to a live agent. In some instances if there are no matches the enterprise data source may specify that the jump node destination bot will send the user to a specialized help menu bot.

As such the jump node has a limited purpose. The jump node captures end user input that is provided that is not expected. It then looks across the entire spectrum of tags available for the associated enterprise data source for potential matches. It then sends these matches if any and the user to the jump node destination bot. That is all the jump node does is funnel the information regarding what the user entered and the matching nodes or other labels into the jump node destination bot which takes that information and then starts to have a new conversation with the end user around the information. The jump node destination bot has knowledge about the user such as what information they have put in. The jump node destination bot has the information from the jump node about what options are available in terms of matches. In some embodiments while the jump node looks across the entire framework of nodes matches within the current bot itself are assumed by the jump node destination bot to be more closely related and are up weighted relative to node matches that are in other bots. But the jump node handles this form of weighting logic. By separating out the node matching jump node and operations that are performed based on the results of the matching jump node destination bot in separate processes the jump process can be fine tuned and customized with each enterprise data source.

Thus in accordance with the above disclosure some embodiments of the systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a jump node in one or more bots. The jump node receives the user s free form message entry and automatically evaluates the message content against all nodes in the graph of the node and in the graph of other nodes of each different associated with a given sub channel or the nodes of each bot associated with any sub channel associated with a given primary channel. The process collects any node matches and passes this data along with the conversation to a dedicated jump node destination bot.

In some embodiments node proximity prioritization is invoked. In such embodiments the nodes in a graph reflect a structural organization between nodes and clusters of nodes. Nodes in proximity to each other expressed through the quantity and types of edge connections between them are logically and thematically more connected and thus up weighted relative to more distant nodes.

The jump node will first collect all node matches for a given free form user message. It then orders multiple matches in order of proximity to the originating node i.e. current conversational location in the current bot . For example any node matches within the existing bot will thereby be listed as the highest priority. Node match proximity information can be passed from the jump node to the jump destination bot.

The internal node structure and therefore the resulting behavior of the jump node destination bot is fully customized and is configurable per primary communication channel and or by sub channel. The jump node destination bot can provide specific responses based on the i number of node matches ii node title content and or iii node proximity.

Conversational static node jump response the desired bot behavior may be to ignore free form messages. The bot could be set up to respond with a specific notification and provide a few specific options for the user to select from e.g. 

Conversational dynamic node jumps the jump node destination bot is set up to evaluate the node matching data it receives from the jump node. A basic jump destination bot configuration reacts to the number of node matches covering the following sample scenarios.

If the core jump node does not find any node matches for the content the user entered the jump node destination bot would be configured to provide an appropriate response e.g. 

In such a case the Return to chat option would take the user back to the origination node i.e. the node at which the user entered the unexpected free form message instead of selecting an option presented by that node . The node re activates and presents its options to the user again. The message and the of the presented options in the jump node are fully customizable.

When the jump node finds a single node match to the user s free form message entry the jump node destination bot would respond with an appropriate message e.g. 

When the jump node finds multiple node matches to the user s free form message entry the jump node destination bot responds with an appropriate message and associated options e.g. 

Enterprise Data Source can Customize Appearance of Content in Sub Channels Through an Application Programming Interface.

Advantageously in the disclosed systems and methods an enterprise data source can customize the content that appears in sub channels . At any given time each such sub channel is hosting a number of conversations each such conversation with a different remote user device associated with a respective end user. As such messages are sent to the end user in such conversations and messages are received from the end user. As discussed in greater detail with respect to below the content of messages received from an end user may trigger certain events such as the activation of a stock message stock widget e.g. also interchangeably referred to herein as a control or an applet stock object e.g. image sound file PDF etc. in the conversation. Thus when a triggering event arises a message sent to the remote user device in a conversation may be highly customized. This very same conversation may have normal text messages. Thus it is possible for conversations to have any number of regular text messages and customized messages.

Referring to block of for illustration a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel processes at least part of the communication bound for the remote user device associated with the first user e.g. in a conversation by receiving an original message from the corresponding enterprise data source . The message is converted into a set of commands that are interpretable with a command parser e.g. a stock widget within the conversation that is running on the remote user device . The set of commands includes instructions for how to display portions of the message on the remote user device that are not present in the original message. The set of commands is submitted to the remote user device associated with the first user for interpretation by a command parser e.g. the widget running on the remote user device . The command parser may then display on the remote user device within the conversation the one or more affordances in accordance with the original message from the enterprise data source .

Referring to block of in some embodiments the instructions for how to display portions of the message on the remote user device include instructions to display one or more affordances e.g. one or more check boxes one or more radio buttons one or more slide bars one or more input fields one or more radio buttons one or more drop down menus or one or more shopping carts on the remote user device .

Referring to block of in some embodiments the set of commands is for an embedded object and the original message specifies a plurality of parameters for the embedded object. For instance in some embodiments the embedded object is a preformatted menu of options and the plurality of parameters are the menu options. Referring to block of in some such embodiments the plurality of parameters comprises a unique identifier for the embedded object a label to be displayed with the embedded object a unique name for the embedded object and a variable that specifies a type e.g. text box text area a radio button a drop down menu a check box list an image a video HTML an option and a check box of the embedded object. In some embodiments the set of commands is for a plurality of such embedded objects. Referring to block of in one example the plurality of parameters further comprises one or more URL to post data from the embedded object after interaction of the embedded object with the first user within the first sub channel .

In an embodiment the secure mobile communication platform provides an automated electronic file cabinet to each of the users for storing attachments to messages in the respective sub channels based on predetermined criteria. In some embodiments the electronic file cabinet is stored on server as illustrated in . In some embodiments the electronic file cabinet is cloud based system and is accessible from any remote user device for example a personal computer a tablet computing device a mobile phone a smart phone a laptop a personal digital assistant etc.

To support the disclosed electronic file cabinet in some embodiments an enterprise data source organizes its attachments with the following considerations. There is one primary channel per enterprise data source multiple sub channels per primary channel and multiple chatrooms per sub channel . Typically the enterprise data source sets up a root folder for high level content at the primary channel level. In some embodiments this high level content is accessible to all primary channel administrators for distribution to users. In some embodiments this high level content is accessible to some sub channel administrators . Below the root folder the enterprise data source sets up a folder for each sub channel . In some embodiments the content in the folder the enterprise data source maintains for a sub channel can be viewed by all sub channel administrators . In some embodiments the content in the folder the enterprise data source maintains for a sub channel can be edited by some sub channel administrators . For each sub channel folder the enterprise data source maintains a folder for each chatroom in the sub channel . In some embodiments the files in the chatrooms can be viewed by all sub channel administrators that have access to the chatrooms. The files in the chatrooms are the files sent by the end users they are not created by the enterprise data source . The enterprise data source manages content to be sent to end user at the primary channel and sub channel levels. In some embodiments to facilitate such a file system architecture the enterprise data source super administrator and or primary channel administrator connects communications module E with an administrative account on Box Dropbox etc. Communications module E then creates a folder owned by the enterprise data source super administrator and or primary channel administrator . Communication module E then creates subfolders for each sub channel . Within each sub channel communications module E creates subfolders for each chatroom. Then the enterprise data source super administrator and or primary channel administrator has full access to the content of these folders. The sub channel administrators have to the content in the sub channel folders. The end user does not have direct access to this file system set up for the enterprise data source. Rather the end user makes use of the electronic file cabinet described below with reference to .

In some embodiments electronic file cabinet of a user such as that illustrated in contains links to the appropriate files stored by enterprise data sources . For instance for a given sub channel of primary channel supported by the user s electronic file cabinet there are links to the documents for that sub channel to the file system of the enterprise data source described above. For instance when a file is sent in a sub channel from an enterprise data source a link to the file is stored in the electronic file cabinet of the user and this link is to an actual copy of the file stored in the file system of the enterprise data source described above. In other embodiments electronic file cabinet of a user such as that illustrated in contains copies of the appropriate files sent by enterprise data sources . For instance when a file is sent in a sub channel from an enterprise data source a copy of this file is stored in the electronic file cabinet of the user indexed to the appropriate sub channel.

As illustrated in from the end user perspective in some embodiments the electronic file cabinet is indexed by user with each such user having a file cabinet. The user file cabinet is indexed in turn by primary channels of the user and for each such respective primary channel a repository for each of the sub channels of the respective primary channel. In some embodiments respective sub channels are further indexed by chatrooms within the sub channels and the user is only granted access to the files in those chatrooms that the user participates in.

In some embodiments files sent from a single enterprise data source to a user are viewed by the remote user at remote user device collectively together. For instance consider the case in which the enterprise data source has established a primary channel containing two sub channels with a remote user at remote user device . Files have been sent to the user in both sub channels and these files have been stored in the electronic file cabinet in the respective sub channel folders. Subsequently when the remote user requests access to files from the enterprise data source the electronic file cabinet provides a listing of all the files in both sub channel folders collectively. Such embodiments operate with the assumption that a user does not need to see files at the sub channel level. However in some embodiments the user is able to segment their query and view just the files in a sub channel of a given enterprise data source. Users may send files to an enterprise data source within chatrooms. In some embodiments such files only appear in the enterprise data source s folder structure and not in the users file system.

In some embodiments the electronic file cabinet stores the messages to or from the user in a sub channel in the corresponding sub channel repository .

In some embodiments the electronic file cabinet only stores the attachments to messages to or from the user in a sub channel in the corresponding sub channel repository .

In some embodiments the electronic file cabinet only stores the attachments to messages to the user in a sub channel in the corresponding sub channel repository . In such embodiments the electronic file cabinet does not store messages to the user and does not store message from the user or attachments from the user.

The electronic file cabinet is useful for a number of use cases. A sub channel administrator may want to share files with consumers using files relevant to a specific sub channel e.g. images for coupons PDFs for instructions . Thus the sub channel administrator may stream these files to the user and the electronic file cabinet conveniently stores these files. In another example a sub channel administrator may want to accept files from consumers such as signed documents or screenshots. Further an end user may want to share files with an enterprise data source by streaming the sub channel administrator in a chat room in a sub channel for the sub channel administrator to review. In still another user case the end user may want to see content shared with the user by an enterprise data source.

In some embodiments users can use and search the electronic file cabinet of the secure mobile communication platform to search for messages and or attachments. For example a user can search the secure cloud based filing system based on respective enterprise data source e.g. all messages or message attachments sent from the enterprise data source to the user or from the user to the enterprise data source a relevant month e.g. all messages or message attachments associated with the user in the relevant month etc. In some embodiments only message attachments and not messages are stored in the electronic file cabinet .

In some embodiments the automated filing system is a combination of file storage and related metadata storage in a database for example a file system implementation using the MySQL database of MySQL AB Company with the ELASTIC SEARCH search engine of Elasticsearch BV. In some embodiments the established primary channels the generated sub channels the stored messages in those optional embodiments where messages are stored in the electronic file cabinet the stored content e.g. file attachments etc. are searchable through the secure mobile communication platform for providing information on demand in real time.

Referring to block of as well as a first sub channel in a plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel processes at least part of the communication from the corresponding enterprise data source associated with the sub channel that is bound for the remote user device associated with a first user by first receiving an original message from the corresponding enterprise data source . The original message is associated with an attachment e.g. a document or a video . An electronic copy of the attachment is made and the electronic copy of the attachment in is stored in the electronic file cabinet associated with the user . The stored electronic copy is indexed to the first sub channel . The original message and the associated attachment is then communicated within the first sub channel to the remote user device associated with the first user.

Referring to block of in some embodiments the electronic file cabinet is stored in a remote device e.g. remote server virtual machine independent of the corresponding enterprise data source . In such embodiments the remote device is addressable by the server system across a network .

Referring to in some embodiments the disclosed systems and methods offer the feature of automatically storing attachments to messages communicated in a sub channel in an electronic file cabinet . In some embodiments the attachments are indexed by sub channel primary channel and by user. In some embodiments the messages and the attachments are stored in the electronic file cabinet . In some embodiments only the attachments are stored in the electronic file cabinet . An example of an attachment that is stored in the electronic file cabinet are billing statements. Advantageously the disclosed systems and methods provide considerable control to system designers on how to set up privileges to the documents stored in the electronic file cabinet . For instance in some embodiments user privileges to documents are set up on a user basis a primary channel administrator basis a sub channel administrator basis and or a third party basis .

User privileges are the privileges the user associated with a given sub channel has with respect to a given document . In some embodiments these privileges are read privileges write privileges edit privileges deletion privileges and or copy privileges to the document .

Primary channel administrator privileges are the privileges the primary channel administrator of the primary channel of the sub channel that communicated the document has with respect to a given document . In some embodiments these privileges are read privileges write privileges edit privileges deletion privileges and or copy privileges to the document .

Sub channel administrator privileges are the privileges the sub channel administrator of the sub channel that communicated the document has with respect to a given document . In some embodiments these privileges are read privileges write privileges edit privileges deletion privileges and or copy privileges to the document .

Third party privileges are the privileges that a third party other than the enterprise data source and the user has with respect to a given document . In some embodiments these privileges are read privileges write privileges edit privileges deletion privileges and or copy privileges to the document .

Accordingly referring to block of in some embodiments an entity associated with the enterprise data source e.g. primary channel administrator privileges sub channel administrator privileges has a first access privilege to the electronic copy of the attachment in the electronic file cabinet associated with the first user. The first user has a second access privilege to the electronic copy of the attachment in the electronic file cabinet associated with the user. In some embodiments the first access privilege is different than e.g. independent of the second access privilege. For example the first access privilege may comprise an edit privilege a read privilege and a deletion privilege to the electronic copy of the attachment in the electronic file cabinet associated with the user . The second access privilege consists of a read privilege to the electronic copy of the attachment in the electronic file cabinet associated with the first user . Referring to block of as another non limiting example the first access privilege and the second access privilege are each independently one or more of edit privileges read privileges and deletion privileges to the electronic copy of the attachment in the electronic file cabinet associated with the first user .

In some embodiments a link to an attachment is generated when the attachment is stored in the electronic file cabinet . Then rather than sending the full electronic version of the attachment to a user from the enterprise data source a link to the attachment now stored in the file cabinet of the user is sent. Block of illustrates such an embodiment a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel processes at least part of the communication from the corresponding enterprise data source that is bound for a remote user device associated with a first user by receiving an original message from the corresponding enterprise data source . The original message is associated with an attachment. The processing of the message causes the attachment to be stored in an electronic file cabinet associated with the first user .

Advantageously the disclosed systems and methods provide a number of application programming interface components that may be incorporated into conversations in sub channels . These application programming interface components are designed to assist the enterprise data source in rapidly setting up functions such as bill payment menus boxes the display of information and other tasks that may facilitate transactions with users. Referring to in some embodiments the communications module such as the instance of the communications module C running on the secure mobile communication platform provides several different application programming interface functions . Each such function has a number of data elements that serve as input to the function . Moreover each such function is associated with an applet that is invoked when the corresponding function is called. Non limiting examples of such applets are bill payment applets menus box applets and applets designed to display retrieved information. In some embodiments an applet of is a form of control of .

Block of illustrates the use of an application programming interface function in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. A sub channel in a plurality of sub channels associated with a primary communication channel processes at least part of the communication from the corresponding enterprise data source that is bound for a remote user device associated with a first user for instance in a one to one conversation between the enterprise data source and the remote user device by receiving an original message from the corresponding enterprise data source. The original message includes a set of data elements and an application programming interface function call associated with the set of data elements. For example consider the case where the application programming interface function call is a menu box. Here the set of data elements would be the menu options for the menu box. Responsive to receiving the original message the communications module automatically and without human intervention invokes the application programming interface function . This invoking passes the set of data elements in the message to the application programming interface function and generates the corresponding applet that is communicated within the first sub channel to the remote user device associated with the first user. For instance continuing with the menu box example an applet is presented within the conversation in the sub channel to the first user with a set of menu options where each of the menu options is one of the data elements in the original message from the enterprise data source . Thus in this way the enterprise data source is able to take advantage of a mature applet by simply providing the data necessary to customize the applet.

Referring to block in some embodiments the applet is an automated agent that is responsive to user input at the remote user device associated with the first user. For instance in some embodiments the applet is an automated human interface module.

Referring to block in some embodiments an applet is able to receive a query from within a first sub channel e.g. within a conversation in the first sub channel . For instance the applet may provide an inventory search panel within the conversation that accepts user queries. Responsive to such a query a search of a database associated with the corresponding enterprise data source is made outside of the first sub channel. This database is electronically addressable by the enterprise data source . Then matches to the query in the database are communicated to the applet within the first sub channel

Referring to block in some embodiments the applet is a bill payment applet and the method further comprises receiving a payment communication from the applet within a first sub channel e.g. from within a conversation in the first sub channel from the first user e.g. the remote user device associated with the first user for goods or a service provided by the enterprise data source . The payment is verified against a credit source associated with the first user e.g. Paypal etc. . When verified by the credit source a database e.g. an accounting database associated with the enterprise data source is updated to reflect the payment. Further there is a communication to the applet within the first sub channel e.g. a one to one conversation in the first sub channel between the enterprise data source and the first user that the payment has been made. When the credit source is unable to verify payment the method further comprises communicating to the applet within the first sub channel that the payment has not been made.

Referring to block of in some embodiments the applet facilitates a marketing campaign sponsored by the corresponding enterprise data source. IN such marketing campaigns individualized messages offering a product service or incentive are sent to users in one to one conversations between the enterprise data source and users associated with remote user devices . Advantageously applets can display these messages on remote user devices and track in real time the disposition of the messages e.g. whether they were read etc. and communicate such information back to the enterprise data source . The enterprise data source may use such information from a single remote user device or aggregated information from several remote user devices to target new messages to one or more users as well as dynamically determine which variables e.g. demographic variables temporal variable etc. affect the success of the campaign. Consider a scenario in which the target is to maximize the percentage of time the sent messages are viewed by users. Does the age of the users affect this target Does the appearance of the message in the applet affect this target Is there some interdependence between age and the appearance of the message in the applet affects this target The disclosed system advantageously addresses these questions in real time. In fact the information acquired from conversations in real time can be used to dynamically segment the user population and optimize what is sent to each portion of the user population.

Referring to block of in some embodiments the applet interprets markup language commands received within the first sub channel at the remote user device associated with the first user. For example in some embodiments an applet is a sophisticated HTML parser that allows for the implementation of sophisticated HTML graphics and other HTML functions within conversations.

The disclosed systems and methods in which enterprises data sources form conversations with individual end users allows for a unique opportunity to effectuate marketing campaigns. In such marketing campaigns individualized messages offering a product service or incentive are sent to end users in one to one conversations between the enterprise data source and users associated with remote user devices . Advantageously these messages are displayed on remote user devices and the real time disposition of such messages e.g. whether they were read etc. is track and such information is communicated back to the enterprise data source . The enterprise data source may use such information from a single remote user device or aggregated information from several remote user devices to target new messages to one or more users as well as dynamically determine which variables e.g. demographic variables temporal variable etc. affect the success of the campaign. Thus referring to block of J a first sub channel in the plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel processes at least part of the communication from the corresponding enterprise data source that is bound for the remote user device associated with the first user in a conversation by receiving an original message from the corresponding enterprise data source in accordance with a message campaign sponsored by the enterprise data source responsive to receiving the original message. Then automatically and without human intervention an application programming interface function is invoked for the message campaign. This passes information in the original message to the application programming interface function and generates an applet e.g. widget control etc. that is communicated within the conversation in the first sub channel to the remote user device associated with the first user. Then monitoring is set up to monitor through communications received from the remotely installed applet within conversation in the first sub channel responses to the messaging campaign. Referring to block in some embodiments the invoked application programming interface function makes use of a value of a demographic characteristic e.g. age a location a level of participation a customer rewards program a length of time enrolled in a customer rewards program a number of purchases the user has made with the enterprise data source a total of amount of purchases the first user has made with the enterprise data source during a predetermined time frame the last time the first user has made with the enterprise data source a type of item the first user has purchased from the enterprise data source or a sex of the first user in the user profile corresponding to the first user to determine which information in the message to pass to the application programming interface function.

Advantageously the unique architecture disclosed herein in which conversations that are traceable to a specific end user of the system provides for a unique opportunity to ensure the security of such conversations and thus the non repudiation of such conversations. For instance due to the traceability of conversations and their security e.g. with all messages in the conversation encrypted in some embodiments when an end user makes a purchase or other form of transaction within a conversation in a sub channel neither the end user nor the enterprise data source can repudiate the purchase claim the transaction did not take place . Accordingly referring to block of a conversation in a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels is associated with a respective primary communication channel is associated with the unique identifier corresponding to first user. The unique identifier is used as a basis for non repudiation of the conversation. In some embodiments the conversation in the first sub channel is used to conduct a purchase or other form of transaction by the first user from the corresponding enterprise data source associated with the conversation.

In some embodiments widgets e.g. controls applets within conversations are hosted on one or more virtual machines. In other embodiments such widgets are hosted elsewhere such as downloaded onto end user devices .

Referring to block of in some embodiments a conversation in a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel processes at least part of the communication from the corresponding enterprise data source that is bound for a remote user device that is associated with a first user by receiving an original message from the corresponding enterprise data source .

In some embodiments the disclosed systems and methods challenges enterprise data sources in unique way prior to onboarding them into the secure mobile communications platform . In some embodiments this challenge is by way of human approval. For instance in some embodiments prior to onboarding a potential new enterprise data source into system a human representative of the potential new enterprise data source is interviewed by a human representative of the secure mobile communications platform . In some embodiments a characteristic of this interview is the disclosure by the potential new enterprise data source of private information that the human representative of the secure mobile communications platform can verify. This is an improvement over conventional social media platforms that do not provide adequate controls to prevent spoofing of well known enterprises data sources e.g. well known department stores . Such activity is prevented by the disclosed secure mobile communications platform because of the verification process that enterprise data sources must undergo in order to be enrolled by the platform . In some embodiments this onboarding of enterprise data sources is performed on an automated basis using a specialized automated human interface module described below in conjunction with where the module has a specialized node graph that steers a potential enterprise data source through a series of nodes depending on information provided by the potential enterprise data source . In such instances the conversation is between the potential enterprise data source and the secure mobile communications platform . In some embodiments artificial intelligence or machine based learning is imposed in one or more nodes of the node graph to assist in on boarding the potential enterprise data source. In some embodiments nodes in the graph will challenge the potential enterprise data source for information and verify this information e.g. check if the potential enterprise data source s IP address is in a specified geographic domain check a web address associated with the potential enterprise data source ask for a scanned or electronic copy of a business card etc. . In some embodiments a node of the automated human interface module will ask for certain documents and will provide a widget in the conversation to assist the potential enterprise data source in uploading these documents. Thus some embodiments of the secure mobile communications platform provides different ways to verify potential enterprise data sources

Block of illustrates an example embodiment for such verification. An enrollment process for a potential enterprise data source is initiated when the enterprise data source makes an enrollment request. Responsive to the enrollment request the potential enterprise data source is electronically challenged. A response to the electronic challenge is received from the potential enterprise data source. In this way the potential enterprise data source is required to establish a basis to a claim of identity as part of enrollment in the secure mobile communications platform . Referring to block of in some embodiments the response to the electronic challenge is parsed using a trained classifier where the trained classifier e.g. a support vector machine neural network etc. to determine whether the response establishes the identity for the enterprise data source.

Referring to the disclosed user interface of the communications module client side C provides with a single affordance e.g. affordance for TARGET the ability to connect with an enterprise data source and obtain all the functionality that enterprise data source could possibly want to provide in single selection of an affordance e.g. a single tap of the affordance . For instance by tapping on affordance of the user interface of module C on the remote user device is updated to the display illustrated in . In all the functionality that TARGET desires to provide to end users is offered as one or more secure sub channels . If desired any of these sub channels can host a secure bi directional conversation between the exemplary enterprise data source TARGET and the end user associated with the remote user device . Further there is no requirement that each of the sub channels host a bidirectional conversation. In some embodiments some of the sub channels may be used to push data such as advertisements media or other forms of information. Moreover as disclosed herein in instances where sub channels host conversations the enterprise data source can build into the conversations widgets e.g. applets that provide any desired functionality to support transactions and end user experience.

In conventional systems an enterprise data source must publish one or more applications to provide a comparable service to the end user. For instance as of the date of the filing of the present disclosure AMAZON publishes one application Amazon Music with Prime Music for listening to music on remote devices a second application Amazon Video for watching videos on remote devices a third application Amazon Prime Now for shopping on the Amazon network a fourth application Amazon Photos for cloud and drive storage and backup and a fifth application Kindle for reading digital books. Thus it is necessary to download from an application store and install on the remote user device each of these applications in order to obtain all of AMAZON s remote device functionally. Moreover AMAZON updates these applications the end user is forced to download and reinstall each of these updated applications on their remote user device . For end users that are interested in interacting with multiple enterprise data sources this leads to an untenable situation where much of their network bandwidth is devoted to the download of numerous updated applications. Using the disclosed secure mobile communications platform it is possible to encapsulate all of this functionality in a single affordance e.g. in the case of TARGET that expands out into a plurality of sub channels . Thus with reference to AMAZON a first sub channel would replace AMAZON s first application Amazon Music with Prime Music a second sub channel would replace AMAZON s second application Amazon Video for watching videos on remote devices a third sub channel would replace AMAZON s third application Amazon Prime Now for shopping on the Amazon network a fourth sub channel would replace AMAZON s fourth application Amazon Photos for cloud and drive storage and backup and a fifth sub channel would replace AMAZON s fifth application Kindle for reading digital books. Thus rather than downloading and installing five applications the user would click a single button and have all the desired functionality. Moreover as illustrated in with affordances if the user did not wish to have certain of the sub channels they could simply turn such sub channels off. Thus the disclosed systems and methods provide a novel environment in which a user connects to a primary channel associated with an enterprise data source and then switches on and off sub channels rather than downloading over and over again applications from application stores. Thus once again referring to the simple act of hitting the affordance for TARGET or the plus affordance for enterprise data source is equivalent to the conventional act of going to an on line application store find the application download the application providing the application with your user name and password each time. In fact in some embodiments of the present disclosure the user profile stores the credentials of the user so that when the user selects a new enterprise data source the credentials are passed on to the new enterprise data source making the addition of a new primary channel to the user interface of module C a one step process.

Block of illustrates this process in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. There is received from a first user a request to view available enterprise data sources in the plurality of enterprise data sources e.g. by selection of affordance in . Responsive to receiving the request a subset of available enterprises data sources in the plurality of enterprise data sources is selected. Information regarding the subset of the plurality of enterprise data sources is sent to the remote user device associated with the first user for instance as illustrated in . A selection of a first enterprise data source in the plurality of enterprise data sources is received from the remote user device associated with the first user. Responsive to receiving the selection of the first enterprise data source the first enterprise data source is added to the user profile corresponding to the first user. The first user is joined to a primary communication channel associated with the enterprise data source . This primary communication channel facilitates electronic communication between the first corresponding enterprise data source and the first user. The user is further joined to a first plurality of sub channels associated with the primary communication channel automatically without human intervention. This first plurality of sub channels form a corresponding first hierarchical tree in which the first primary communication channel is a root node and the first plurality of sub channels are child nodes. At least one sub channel in the first hierarchy of sub channels enables a conversation comprising bidirectional communication between i the remote user device associated with the first user and ii the first enterprise data source. The conversation is limited to only this first user no other first user may participate in the conversation although the enterprise data source may use the sub channel to host similar private conversations with other end users. In this way one or more secure transmissions and one or more secure receptions of messages is facilitated between the first enterprise data source and the remote user device associated with the first user.

Referring to block of the selection of the first enterprise data source from the remote user device associated with the first user is made when the first user selects an affordance on the display of the remote user device that is associated with the first enterprise data source.

Referring to block of in some embodiments the affordance is a plus sign displayed next to a designation of the first enterprise data source on the display of the remote user device.

Referring to block in some embodiments the adding obtains a user credential for the first user from the profile of the first user and passes this user credential e.g. phone number a login a password a street address a credit card number a name a government issued number for the first user or an E mail address to the first enterprise data source to verify the first user to the first enterprise data source.

Natural language processing of customer queries while viewing catalogs. Referring to block of a catalog or other information is communicated from the enterprise data source to the remote user device associated with a first user within a conversation hosted by a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels. A response from the first user regarding the catalog or other information provided by the enterprise data source is received within the conversation in the first sub channel. The catalog selection or other forms of user selection such as menu choice selection etc. is processed using an automated human interface module e.g. automated human interface module employing a trained classifier thereby generating a reply to the catalog selection or other form of end user selection . A determination is made as to whether the reply is deemed to be satisfactory. For instance consider a situation where a user made a request for paint thinner. All responses to this user query are run through a classifier to determine whether the responses to the request are satisfactory. For instance if the replies pertain to paint thinner because the phrase paint thinner appears in the text of the responsive documents the classifier will deem the documents satisfactory. When the reply is deemed to be satisfactory the reply is communicated to the remote device associated with the first user within the conversation in the first sub channel. When the reply is deemed to not be satisfactory communication on the first sub channel e.g. the conversation between the remote user device associated with the first user and the enterprise data source is switched to a human associate with the corresponding enterprise data source of the first sub channel e.g. the conversation is routed to the sub channel administrator queue of . Referring to block in some embodiments the trained classifier makes the determination as to whether the reply is deemed to be satisfactory. Referring to block in some embodiments the automated human interface module employing the trained classifier is not associated with the enterprise data source .

Advantageously the secure mobile communication platform support permits geographic dependent messages. For instance referring to block of a location of a remote user device associated with a first user within a first sub channel in the corresponding plurality of sub channels associated with a respective primary communication channel in the plurality of primary communication channels is received. A determination is made as to whether the location is within a geographical zone e.g. country region state city town county metro code zip code in a plurality of geographical zones. When the location is within a geographical zone in the geographical plurality of zones information from the enterprise data source is communicated to the remote user device associated with the first user within the first sub channel based at least in part on the location. When the location is not within a geographical zone in the geographical plurality of zones no information from the enterprise data source is communicated to the remote user device associated with the first user within the first sub channel .

To illustrate an enterprise data source e.g. business entity for example MORANDI restaurant of Morandi LLC. offers a special offer for example a temporal offer from Mar. 2 2015 through Mar. 5 2015 to users subscribing to the ZAGATS.NYC.bestItalian. sub channel . In an embodiment the SMCB implements a periodic geolocation mechanism to transmit location sensitive messages to users through the sub channels . As used herein periodic geolocation mechanism refers to a method of determining a geolocation of a user e.g. consumer and delivering different content to the user based on the user s location parameters comprising for example country region state city metro code zip code organization internet protocol IP address an internet service provider ISP etc. The SMCB triggers a push notification if the user due to the periodic geolocation obtained from the remote user device associated with the user heartbeats with a SMCB presence service when proximal to the MORANDI restaurant. For example if the user is within a two mile radius of the MORANDI restaurant then the SMCB sends the user a message about a 25 discount on a billing transaction for a dinner for two provided the billing transaction is greater than 150 through the sub channel . In an embodiment a consumer agent on a server or a cloud computer handles the push notification for example by performing a k cluster nearest neighbor calculation to determine a match with a standard deviation of 1 mile. As used herein k cluster nearest neighbor calculation refers to a pattern recognition calculation performed for statistical classification and regression analysis. The geolocation heartbeat can be expressed on a GOOGLE Map of Google Inc. to show pulse rate and movement of the user in a particular location. In an embodiment the SMCB supports the delivery of a message based on time scheduling with users being deemed active or relevant if they meet demographic criteria and are in a particular geographical location defined for example by a longitudinal and latitudinal address and therefore sends a message and or an offer to those users in real time through their respective sub channels .
