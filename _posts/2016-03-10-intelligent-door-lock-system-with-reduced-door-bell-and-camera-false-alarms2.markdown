The present invention is directed to intelligent door lock systems and more particularly to intelligent door lock systems with a motion detection device that provides for a reduction in false alarms or alerts.

Existing security systems for homes and commercial properties feature multiple video camera connected to a security box. The security box contains electronics to convert analog video and optional audio inputs to digital and performs audio and video compression by a System On Chip SoC processor which then stores the results on a hard disk. The system could be programmed for continuous recording in a loop recording upon a trigger caused by external alarm and scene change threshold or timed scheduled recording. The cameras are connected by cabling and video is transmitted as analog to the main system. Such cabling makes it difficult to install the multiple cameras inside and outside a residence or commercial because of routing of such long cabling between a dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user accessible box and cameras. Such a system provides 240 frames per second capture which is divided by multiple cameras. For an 8 camera system each camera video is captured at 240 8 or 30 fps but capture resolution is usually low at CIF resolution 350 240 . Such a security box can display captured video live from cameras or from hard disk on a monitor or TV and dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user functions are controlled by front panel buttons or an infrared remote control unit RCU . This means such a security box must be located near a TV and be visible for RCU operation. Such a system also provides means for remote viewing over internet and can also send email messages with some snap shots of video when an alarm trigger occurs. However there is much vulnerability in such a system. If internet is not working at the time of intrusion because phone or internet cables are externally cut then no such email could be send. Thief can easily remove or damage the whole security box which removes all security data.

Another existing video security systems use networked security based where multiple camera units are connected to a PC or laptop computer over local area network or wide area network. For example 9 wireless camera units can connect to a PC computer using Ethernet wires or 802.11 wireless communications. Each camera unit contains video camera video compression and network interface in this case. Existing systems use JPEG or MPEG 2 or MPEG 4 systems but in the future this will probably extend to advanced H.264 video compression standard as well in new designs. If there is no local computer it is also possible to connect the cameras to a router connected to a WAN gateway so that multiple security video channels could be streamed to a remote PC or laptop. The remote PC or laptop could perform remote viewing or recording of one or multiple channels on its hard disk storage. One of the disadvantages of such a security system is that if internet access deliberately interrupted at the time of a security event then it is not possible to stream the data for the event to the remote PC for recording. If the PC is located locally then it could easily be removed by the perpetrators. Furthermore such a system requires continuous stream of multiple video streams over local and wide area networks which places a considerably load on such networks thus causing unreliable operations and slowing other network activity.

Existing security systems use a dumb PIR sensor or they just look to see if anything has moved in a video picture. This produces a fair amount of false alarms. There is a need for an improved security system. There is a further need for a security system with fewer false alarms. There is yet another need for an intelligent security system with a reduction of false alarms.

In various embodiments the positioning sensing device is coupled to the drive shaft by a variety of means including but not limited to the adapters . In one embodiment the position sensing device uses a single measurement as defined herein of drive shaft position sensing which is used to determine movement in order the determine the location of the drive shaft and the positioning sensing device . The exact position of the drive shaft can be measured with another measurement without knowledge of any previous state. Single movement which is one determination of position sensing is the knowledge of whether the door is locked unlocked or in between. One advantage of the accelerator is that one can determine position leave if off come back at a later time and the accelerometer will know its current position even if it has been moved since it has been turned off. It will always know its current position.

In one embodiment the positioning sensing device is directly coupled to the drive shaft as illustrated in . Sensing position of the positioning sensing device is tied to the movement of the drive shaft . In one embodiment with an accelerometer the accelerometer can detect X Y and Z movements. Additional information is then obtained from the X Y and Z movements. In the X and Y axis the position of the drive shaft is determined this is true even if the drive shaft is in motion. The Z axis is used to detect a variety of things including but not limited to door knocking picking of the lock break in and unauthorized entry door open and closing motion. If a mobile device is used to open or close the processor determines the lock state.

In one embodiment the same positioning sensing device is able to detect knocks by detecting motion of the door in the Z axis. As a non limiting example position sensing is in the range of counter and clock wise rotation of up to 180 degrees for readings. The maximum rotation limit is limited by the position sensing device and more particularly to the accelerometer cable. In one embodiment the result is sub 1 resolution in position sensing. This provides a higher lifetime because sampling can be done at a slower rate due to knowing the position after the position sensing device has been turned off for a time period of no great 100 milli seconds. With the present invention accuracy can be enhanced taking repeated measurements. With the present invention the positioning sensing device such as the accelerometer does not need to consume additional power beyond what the knock sensing application already uses.

In one embodiment the position sensing device is positioned on the drive shaft or on an element coupled to the drive shaft . In one embodiment a position of the drive shaft and power sensing device and or a torque limited link are known.

The intelligent door lock system can be a new lock system mounted to a door with all or most of the elements listed above or it can be retrofitted over an existing lock device .

To retrofit the intelligent door lock system with an existing lock system the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user makes sure that the existing lock device and bolt lock is installed right side up. The existing thumb turn is then removed. With some lock devices additional mounting plates need to be removed and the intelligent door lock system can include replacement screws that are used. The correct mounting plate is then selected. With the existing screws in the thumb turn the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user sequentially aligns with 1 of 4 mounting plates that are supplied or exist.

A door can be deformed warped and the like. It is desirable to provide a customer or dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user information about the door e.g. if it is deformed out of alignment if too much friction is applied when opening and closing and the like.

As recited above the current sensor monitors the amount of current that goes to the motor and this information is received and processed by the engine processor with memory and is coupled to the circuit . The amount of current going to the motor is used to determine the amount of friction experienced by door and or lock device in opening and or closing as applied by the intelligent door lock system and the positioning sensing device to the drive shaft . The circuit and engine processor can provide for an adjustment of current. The engine processor can provide information regarding the door and friction to the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user of the door .

In one embodiment of the present invention the intelligent door lock system provides an ability to sense friction on the lock device and or door by measuring the torque required to move the bolt lock . The intelligent door lock system increases the applied torque gradually until the bolt lock moves into its desired position and the applied torque is the minimum amount of torque required to move the bolt lock which is directly related to how deformed the door is.

In one embodiment when a bad door is detected a customer can be notified that their door may require some servicing. In one embodiment door deformation can be detected with a torque device is used to determine if the torque applied when the door is rotated is too high. As a non limiting example this can be 2 15 in lbs of torque The intelligent door lock system back end can then perform a comparison between the measured torque with a standard or a norm that is included in the one or more databases .

In one embodiment of the present invention before the door is serviced the intelligent door lock system allows operation by offering a high friction mode. As a non limiting example the high friction mode is when as non limiting examples 2 inch lbs 3 inch lbs. 3.5 inch pounds and the like are required to open the door. In the high friction mode the bolt lock is driven while the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is pushing lifting torquing the door pulling performing visual inspections of rust blockage other conditions that can compromise a door and the like that is applied to the doorknob. The position sensing device is used to determine if the bolt lock was moved to a final position. In the high friction mode motion of the door closing is confirmed. Upon detecting the closing of the door the bolt lock is then driven. When the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user receives an auditory visual or any other type of perceptible confirmation the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user then knows that the door has been locked. In one embodiment the firmware elements of the intelligent door lock system as well as other door lock device elements can also attempt to drive the bolt lock for a second time when the first time fails. However this can result in more power consumption reducing lifetime of the power source particularly when it is battery based.

In one embodiment of the present invention the intelligent door lock system seeks to have the motor operate with reduced energy consumption for energy source lifetime purposes as well as eliminate or reduce undesirable noises operations and dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user experiences that occur when this is a failure in door locking and unlocking particularly due to door deformation door non alignment as well as other problems with the door that can be irritating to the person locking or unlocking the door.

In one embodiment of the present invention the intelligent door lock system back end can track performance of doors and friction levels across time and build a service to encourage dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end users to better maintain their doors. Such service can be a comparison of a door s friction level to other users that have similar geographic locations at similar weather pattern such that the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is encouraged to maintain their doors at a competent level. There can be a comparison to standards that at a certain level the door becomes unsafe. Guidelines are provided as to how to maintain their doors. This can be achieved by asking a door dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user what improves their door including but not limited to pushing lifting torquing the door pulling visual inspections of rust blockage other conditions that can compromise a door and the like.

In one embodiment the back end can anticipate these problems. As non limiting examples these can include but are not limited to due to analysis of doors in similar geographic areas doors under similar conditions doors with similar histories similar environmental conditions as well as the history of a particular door and the like.

The deformed mode provides cooperation with the door dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user to more readily open the door. In one embodiment this is a mechanism for the door to communicate back to the door lock operator. As a non limiting example feedback can be provided to the door operator. Such feedback can include but is not limited to communication via tactile audio visual temperature electronic wirelessly through a computer mobile device and the like. In another embodiment the operator can signify to the door the operator s desire to leave by unlocking and opening the door . This is a door operator and lock communication. The door operator can close the door which is sensed by the intelligent door lock system a timer can then be initiated to provide with door operator with a selected time period in which the door operator can manually alleviate the friction problem. When the time has expired the intelligent door system can then lock the door . Upon detecting a successful door locking event the intelligent door lock system can advise the door operator that there is a successful door locking. If the door locking is not successful the intelligent door lock system can provide a message to the door operator via a variety of means including but not limited to a message or alert to the door lock operator s mobile device . Such a mobile device message provides the door operator with notification that door locking was not successful or achieved and the door lock operator can then take action to lock the door either in person wirelessly and the like.

For entry communication with the lock device may be different. In one embodiment it can be locking coupled with close proximity to a mobile device that is exterior to the door.

In another embodiment of the present invention the intelligent door lock system back end can track performance of doors and friction levels across time and build a simple service to encourage dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end users to maintain their doors better as discussed above.

In one embodiment of the present invention the intelligent door lock system unlocks when a selected temperature is reached when smoke is detected when a fire is detected by processor and the like. As non limiting examples the intelligent door lock system unlocks the bolt lock when a temperature is sensed by the temperature sensor that as non limiting examples is greater than 40 degrees C. any temperature over 45 degrees C. and the like. The temperature sensor sends a signal to the processor which communicates with the motor that will then cause the drive shaft to rotate sufficiently and unlock the bolt lock . An arm can also be activated. It will be appreciated that the processor can be anywhere as long as it is in communication with the temperature sensor and the motor which can be at the intelligent door lock system at the back end anywhere in the building and at any remote location. The processor determines if there is an unsafe condition e.g. based on a rise in temperature and this then results in an unlocking of the bolt lock .

These modular adapters as shown in may be used to match the existing extension rod of the bolt assembly . The smart door lock housing may further include an energy source such as a battery a motor assembly such as a compact high torque high accuracy stepper motor and a circuit board that has at least a processor a first wireless connectivity circuit and a second wireless connectivity circuit as described above. In one embodiment the first wireless connectivity circuit may be a Bluetooth chip that allows the smart door lock to communicate using a Bluetooth protocol with a computing device of a dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user such as a Smartphone tablet computer and the like. The second wireless connectivity circuit may be a WiFi chip that allows the smart door lock to communicate using a WiFi protocol with a back end server system. The circuit board components may be intercoupled to each other and also coupled to the energy source and the motor for power and to control the motor respectively. Each of the components described here may be coupled to the energy source and powered by the energy source.

The intelligent door lock system may be used for various functions. As a non limiting example the intelligent door lock system may enable a method to exchange a security token between mobile or computing device and the intelligent door look system . All or all of the intelligent door look systems may be registered with the intelligent door lock back end with a unique registration ID. The unique ID of the an intelligent door look system may be associated with a unique security token that can only be used to command a specific intelligent door look system to lock or unlock. Through a virtual key provisioning interface of the intelligent door lock system back end a master user who may be an administrator can issue a new security token to a particular mobile or computing device . The intelligent door look system can periodically broadcast an advertisement of its available services over System Networks. When the mobile or computing device is within a predetermined proximity of the intelligent door look system which varies depending on the protocol being used the mobile or computing device can detect the advertisement from the intelligent door lock assembly .

The application on the mobile or computing device detects the intelligent door look system and a communications session can be initiated. The token illustrated as a key in is exchanged and the lock is triggered to unlock automatically. Alternatively if the intelligent door look system is equipped with a second wireless communications circuit then the intelligent door look system can periodically query the intelligent door lock system back end for commands. A dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user can issue commands via a web interface to the intelligent door lock system back end and the intelligent door look system can lock or unlock the door . The intelligent door lock system may also allow the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user to disable auto unlock at which time the application on the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile or computing device can provide a notification which then allows the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user to press a button on the mobile or computing device to lock or unlock the lock.

The intelligent door lock system may also allow for the triggering of multiple events upon connection to an intelligent door look system by a mobile or computing device . As a non limiting example the intelligent door look system can detect and authenticate the mobile or computing device as described herein and initiate a series of actions including but not limiting to unlocking doors turning on lights adjusting temperature turning on stereo etc.

With the present invention analogies of any of the preceding can be detected. When an anomaly is detected the owner can be detected via its mobile device via the cloud or through a system backend and an action be taken. In certain embodiments authorities can be immediately contacted and investigate the situation dwelling user resource owner or end user.

In one embodiment the motivation for anomaly detection is to discover events that are outside of threshold settings. Events could be malicious ones such as a hacker attempting to remotely operate a lock a burglar breaking a window or pushing in a door or non malicious events such as a door that has been left open for longer than normal.

As a non limiting example normal events would be normal smart lock operation and door operations that fall within threshold values such as a commuter who operates the door lock once in the morning and then once in the evening when they return home.

In one embodiment the calculation of an anomaly could be done by collecting signal values from devices and sensors such as a smart door lock camera microphone etc. that capture video audio motion seismic or other event data. Data from each device could have a weighting factor attached to it and a total event value could be calculated by multiplying each signal value by its weighting factor and then summing all signal values. If the total event value is greater than the anomaly threshold then additional alerts or actions could be triggered such as automatically locking the door or sending a notification to the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user. Total Event Value 1 door 2 window . . . 

The commands for these actions may be carried out by the mobile or computing device or the intelligent door lock system back end . In addition through a web interface of the intelligent door lock system back end the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user may define one or more events to be triggered upon proximity detection and authentication of the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile or computing device to the intelligent door look system .

The intelligent door lock system may also allow for the intelligent triggering of events associated with an individual. In particular environmental settings may be defined per individual in the intelligent door lock system back end and then applied intelligently by successive ingress by that person into a building that has an intelligent door look system . For example person A arrives home and its mobile or computing device is authenticated by the intelligent door look system . His identity is shared with the intelligent door lock system back end . The intelligent door lock system back end may send environmental changes to other home controllers such as adjust heat to 68 degrees . Person B arrives at the same building an hour later and her mobile or computing device is also authenticated and shared with the intelligent door lock system back end . The intelligent door lock system back end access her preferred environmental variables such as adjust heat to 71 degrees . The intelligent door lock system back end understands that person B has asked for a temperature increase and issues the respective command to the dwelling user resource owner or end user thermostat. In one example the intelligent door lock back end system has logic that defers to the higher temperature request or can deny it. Therefore if person A entered the home after person B the temperature would not be decreased.

Further utilization of any number of the cloud service providers similar to the cloud services provider is contemplated. According to an illustration disparate cloud services providers can be maintained by differing off premise parties and a participant can employ concurrently at different times and the like all or a subset of the cloud services providers.

By leveraging resources supported by the cloud services provider limitations commonly encountered with respect to hardware associated with clients and servers within proprietary intranets can be mitigated. Off premises parties or Network System administrators of servers within proprietary intranets can maintain troubleshoot replace and update the hardware resources. Further for example lengthy downtimes can be mitigated by the cloud services provider utilizing redundant resources thus if a subset of the resources are being updated or replaced the remainder of the resources can be utilized to service requests from participants. According to this example the resources can be modular in nature and thus resources can be added removed tested modified etc. while the remainder of the resources can support servicing participant requests. Moreover hardware resources supported by the cloud services provider can encounter fewer constraints with respect to storage processing power security bandwidth redundancy graphical display rendering capabilities etc. as compared to conventional hardware associated with clients and servers within proprietary intranets.

The system can include a client device which can be the wearable device and or mobile device that employs resources of the cloud services provider. Although one client device is depicted it is to be appreciated that the system can include any number of client devices similar to the client device and the plurality of client devices can concurrently utilize supported resources. By way of illustration the client device can be a desktop device e.g. personal computer mobile device and the like. Further the client device can be an embedded system that can be physically limited and hence it can be beneficial to leverage resources of the cloud services provider.

Resources can be shared amongst a plurality of client devices subscribing to the cloud services provider. According to an illustration one of the resources can be at least one central processing unit CPU where CPU cycles can be employed to effectuate computational tasks requested by the client device. Pursuant to this illustration the client device can be allocated a subset of an overall total number of CPU cycles while the remainder of the CPU cycles can be allocated to disparate client device s .

Further a number of CPU cycles can be purchased by the participant of the client device. In accordance with another example the resources can include data store s that can be employed by the client device to retain data. The participant employing the client device can have access to a portion of the data store s supported by the cloud services provider while access can be denied to remaining portions of the data store s e.g. the data store s can selectively mask memory based upon participant device identity permissions and the like . It is contemplated that any additional types of resources can likewise be shared.

The cloud services provider can further include an interface component that can receive input s from the client device and or enable transferring a response to such input s to the client device as well as perform similar communications with any disparate client devices .

In one embodiment the cloud services provider includes a dynamic allocation component that apportions resources which as a non limiting example can be hardware resources supported by the cloud services provider to process and respond to the input s e.g. request s data executable program s and the like obtained from the client device.

Although the interface component is depicted as being separate from the dynamic allocation component it is contemplated that the dynamic allocation component can include the interface component or a portion thereof. The interface component can provide various adaptors connectors channels communication paths etc. to enable interaction with the dynamic allocation component.

In one embodiment a system includes the cloud services provider that supports any number of resources e.g. hardware software and firmware that can be employed by the client device and or disparate client device s not shown. The cloud services provider further comprises the interface component that receives resource utilization requests including but not limited to requests to effectuate operations utilizing resources supported by the cloud services provider from the client device and the dynamic allocation component that partitions resources including but not limited to between participants devices computational tasks and the like. Moreover the dynamic allocation component can further include a participant state evaluator an enhancement component and an auction component.

The dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user state evaluator can determine a state associated with a dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user and or the client device employed by the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user where the state can relate to a set of properties. For instance the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user state evaluator can analyze explicit and or implicit information obtained from the client device e.g. via the interface component and or retrieved from memory associated with the cloud services provider e.g. preferences indicated in subscription data . State related data yielded by the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user state evaluator can be utilized by the dynamic allocation component to tailor the apportionment of resources.

In one embodiment the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user state evaluator can consider characteristics of the client device which can be used to apportion resources by the dynamic allocation component. For instance the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user state evaluator can identify that the client device is a mobile device with limited display area. Thus the dynamic allocation component can employ this information to reduce resources utilized to render an image upon the client device since the cellular telephone may be unable to display a rich graphical dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user interface.

Moreover the enhancement component can facilitate increasing an allocation of resources for a particular participant and or client device.

The dynamic allocation component can further comprise a load balancing component that optimizes utilization of resources.

In one embodiment the load balancing component can monitor resources of the cloud services provider to detect failures. If a subset of the resources fails the load balancing component can continue to optimize the remaining resources. Thus if a portion of the total number of processors fails the load balancing component can enable redistributing cycles associated with the non failing processors.

In one embodiment a system archives and or analyzes data utilizing the cloud services provider. The cloud services provider can include the interface component that enables communicating with the client device. Further the cloud services provider comprises the dynamic allocation component that can apportion data retention resources for example. Moreover the cloud services provider can include an archive component and any number of data store s .

The data store s can be centrally located and or positioned at differing geographic locations. Further the archive component can include a management component a versioning component a security component a permission component an aggregation component and or a restoration component.

The data store s can be for example either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory or can include both volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration and not limitation nonvolatile memory can include read only memory ROM programmable ROM PROM electrically programmable ROM EPROM electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory RAM which acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation RAM is available in many forms such as static RAM SRAM dynamic RAM DRAM synchronous DRAM SDRAM double data rate SDRAM DDR SDRAM enhanced SDRAM ESDRAM Synchlink DRAM SLDRAM Rambus direct RAM RDRAM direct Rambus dynamic RAM DRDRAM and Rambus dynamic RAM RDRAM . The data store s of the subject systems and methods is intended to comprise without being limited to these and any other suitable types of memory. In addition it is to be appreciated that the data store s can be a server a database a hard drive and the like.

The management component facilitates administering data retained in the data store s . The management component can enable providing multi tiered storage within the data store s for example. According to this example unused data can be aged out to slower disks and important data used more frequently can be moved to faster disks however the claimed subject matter is not so limited. Further the management component can be utilized e.g. by the client device to organize annotate and otherwise reference content without making it local to the client device. Pursuant to an illustration enormous video files can be tagged via utilizing a cell phone. Moreover the management component enables the client device to bind metadata which can be local to the client device to file streams e.g. retained in the data store s the management component can enforce and maintain these bindings.

Additionally or alternatively the management component can allow for sharing data retained in the data store s with disparate participants and or client devices. For example fine grained sharing can be supported by the management component.

The versioning component can enable retaining and or tracking versions of data. For instance the versioning component can identify a latest version of a document regardless of a saved location within data store s .

The security component limits availability of resources based on participant identity and or authorization level. For instance the security component can encrypt data transferred to the client device and or decrypt data obtained from the client device. Moreover the security component can certify and or authenticate data retained by the archive component.

The permission component can enable a participant to assign arbitrary access permissions to various participants groups of participants and or all participants.

Further the aggregation component assembles and or analyzes collections of data. The aggregation component can seamlessly incorporate third party data into a particular participant s data.

The restoration component rolls back data retained by the archive component. For example the restoration component can continuously record an environment associated with the cloud services provider. Further the restoration component can playback the recording.

The relative signal strength of connections to these two devices during lock operations is recorded as a threshold value. When the proximity to the bridge placed inside the home is closer than before the lock operation we will compute algorithmically that the device is inside the home.

In one embodiment a lock device operation of the intelligent door lock system followed by a rapid change of proximity is an indicator of going from the dwelling user resource owner or end user.

The process of begins by measuring the signal strength of wireless signals between the bridge and the Bluetooth LE devices at step . The signal strength may be measured in any of the ways discussed above including the bridge measuring the power of downstream wireless signals. Step may be initiated in accordance with a predefined schedule or in response to a predetermined event.

At step parameter data of the non interconnect device is determined. The parameter data may include location time and or velocity coordinates associated with the non interconnect device at the time of the signal strength measurement. Step may be performed in any variety of ways including but not limited to the use of GPS information.

The signal strength may be measured in any of the ways discussed above including measuring the power of downstream wireless signals being received from the cloud lock access services relative to bridge and a Bluetooth LE device . Step may be initiated in accordance with a predefined schedule or in response to a predetermined event.

At step it is determined whether the measured signal strength is lower than a predetermined threshold. The predetermined threshold may be defined by network operators and may be based on a desired level of signal power that provides effective signal strength. If it is determined at step that the measured signal strength is not lower than the predetermined threshold the process returns to step at which step another measurement of signal strength is obtained either immediately according to an established schedule or in response to a predetermined trigger event.

On the other hand if it is determined at step that the measured signal strength is lower than the predetermined threshold the process continues at step . In one embodiment at step parameter data of the Bluetooth LE device is determined. As non limiting examples the parameter data may include location time and or velocity coordinates associated with the Bluetooth LE device relative to the bridge . Step may be performed in any of the ways discussed above including using GPS signals to determine GPS coordinate data.

At step it is determined whether the measured signal strength is adequate for transmission of data upstream to the cloud lock access services from the Bluetooth LE device . Step may be performed by comparing the measured signal strength to a predetermined transmission threshold which may be defined by network operators based on a level of signal power that supports reliable upstream data transmissions from the wireless device.

If it is determined at step that the measured signal strength is inadequate for transmission of data the process continues at step . At step the signal strength and parameter data are buffered for subsequent transmission. Step may be performed by storing the data to memory to maintain the data until it can be transmitted. In one embodiment from step the process returns to step to obtain another measurement of signal strength. Multiple instances of data may be buffered until signal strength becomes strong enough for the stored data to be transmitted from the Bluetooth LE device . In other words steps may be repeated with different measurements being gathered and stored for later transmission when the signal strength becomes strong enough to support upstream transmissions.

If it is determined at step that the measured signal strength is adequate for data transmission the process continues to step . At step the signal strength and parameter data are transmitted to the cloud lock access services. Step may be performed in any of the ways discussed above including using upstream control communication or out of band channels of the wireless network .

Triangulation forms sets of circles. Each of the reference points access points or becomes the center of a circle and the distances between the object and the center d d or d becomes the radius of that circle.

Triangulation estimates locations based on various intersection areas formed by these circles. If three formed circles meet at a single spot that spot becomes the location estimate as a result of the triangulation. However as a practical matter the three circles rarely will meet at a single spot. More often if the circles intersect they will intersect in multiple spots. In the three circles have six intersection points P P P P P and P. The triangulation algorithm examines areas formed by the intersection points to obtain a location estimate for the bridge the intelligent door lock system and the Bluetooth LE device. Specifically the triangle formed by P P and P has the smallest area among all possible triangles formed by these intersection points and the centroid X of the triangle P P and P is the best location estimate of the object.

In particular these five triplets are signal strength triplet a b c at position L x y from a b and c signal strength triplet a b c at position L x y from a b and c and signal strength triplet a b c at position L x y from a b and c. L . . . L are determined by using the location information database. The location information database for RF based static scene analysis typically contains entries used to map RF signal metrics to positions i.e. transfer from signal domain to space domain . The positions of these five locations are averaged to yield the location estimate of the object as follows 1 2 3 4 5 5 2 

In one embodiment the conventional static scene analysis maps from the radio signal domain to the space domain. The final estimate is typically within a coordinate system. A main drawback of the static scene analysis is that it cannot effectively cope with the impact of errors in the radio signal domain. Due to interference and noise objects at different locations might be represented similarly in the radio signal domain a phenomenon called aliasing. The conventional methods cannot detect aliasing and may provide these different locations with similar location estimates.

In one embodiment selective fusion location estimation SELFLOC algorithm selectively combines or fuses multiple location information sources to yield a combined estimate in a theoretically optimal manner. The SELFLOC algorithm is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 330 523 filed Dec. 27 2002 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The branch weights and are calibrated during the off line stage using error feedback. A minimum mean square error MMSE algorithm can be used for SELFLOC weight training and calibration. As shown in three location estimates available independently are to be fused and x coordinates of these estimates are X X and X. The weights for these input branches are w w and W respectively. Thus the SELFLOC estimate X could be written as 1 1 2 2 3 3 4

In one embodiment a lock system is coupled to a lock at a dwelling of a dwelling user resource owner or end user collectively the user. An intelligent door lock system is provided with a remotely operable lock at the dwelling accessible by the user as illustrated in . The intelligent door lock system is configured to be in communication with a server . An automatic unlock system is activated when the user communicates with the server using the user s mobile device . The server is configured to transmit a crossing notification message in response to tracking the user s mobile device and enable an automatic unlock feature of the lock using the server and a mobile device App

In one embodiment when the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user enables an automatic unlock of system it can view its current location on a map as a means of visual verification that it is being set up properly. In one embodiment a dwelling user resource owner or end user threshold region can be viewed and or adjusted by the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user. In this embodiment the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user implicitly indicates that when it has left the area then on returning to the area the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user would like its door unlocked as the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user approaches it. A dwelling user resource owner or end user threshold region can be adjusted larger to compensate for poor GPS positioning available in a remote dwelling user resource owner or end user region.

As a non limiting example the following steps can be followed. The dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user exits the dwelling user resource owner or end user. One or both inner and outer geo fences can be exited. In the event that both geo fences are exited after a certain period of time door is then locked. When the inner fence is only exited system does not lock door . The server can enable detailed GPS detection to verify that the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has left the area defined by geo fences and . The dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user can enter outer geo fence and mobile device App wakes up. Dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user mobile device examines a sufficient to determine whether to activate Bluetooth and search for door in order to unlock door . The data can include time spent outside geo fence or geo fence time of day past dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user activity patterns dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user habits motion data recorded including but not limited to driving activity walking or running activity and the like dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user activity data WiFi access point information and the like. The server can enable detailed GPS detection to verify that the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has returned to the dwelling user resource owner or end user. Using this information the server decides if the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is returning to the dwelling user resource owner or end user.

The server synthesizes the configuration data which can include thresholds and probabilities with the activity data on the service and determines if the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is returning to the dwelling user resource owner or end user. In the case where there are multiple geo fences e.g. more than just inner geo fence the server can decide multiple times if this is true in order to determine if the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is returning to the dwelling user resource owner or end user. Bluetooth is activated on the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile phone to search for the dwelling user resource owner or end user lock. When the lock is detected the server connects to it establishes a secure connection unlocks door and can notify the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user via mobile device that door has been unlocked.

System receives notifications when the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has left and entered the area as defined by the one or more geo fences . At least a portion of the Bayesian algorithm or other filtering algorithm filters spurious location events that can be erroneous due to environmental or technical glitches which as a non limiting example can be a power outage. If system sees that the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has entered the dwelling user resource owner or end user area less than 90 seconds after entering then system can discard it.

In one embodiment of the present invention first and second geo fences and are provided also known as inner and outer geo fences and . When first and second geo fences and are exited after a certain time period door is then locked or a notification is sent warning the user door at the user s dwelling has been unlocked. If the first geo fence is only exited system may not lock door . User s mobile device can also enable detailed GPS detection to verify that the user has left the area.

In one embodiment of the present invention an automatic unlock uses a mobile device s location features to tell when the mobile device dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has left a geo fence and or in an area outside of a dwelling user resource owner or end user. As a non limiting example this can be considered the first geo fence second geo fence both or just one. At a later time when the mobile device dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user returns to its neighborhood an app of the mobile device prepares to connect to the intelligent door lock system via the system server and or cloud based server . As the mobile device owner approaches an entrance to the dwelling user resource owner or end user the intelligent lock system can automatically unlocks a door .

In one embodiment the automatic unlock feature is on the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile device app that uses the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile device location features to tell when dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user leaves. At this point the first geo fence is triggered. As a result of dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user leaving the geo fence is triggered and when dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is at the dwelling user resource owner or end user the geo fence is on and the Bluetooth is also on. At entrance to the first geo fence the Bluetooth is turned on and the Bluetooth creates a signal to unlock system . There is no need for dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user to utilize its mobile device .

When dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user enables an automatic unlock of system it may view its current location on a map as a means of visual verification that it is being set up properly. A home threshold region can be viewed adjusted and the like by the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user. In one embodiment dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user implicitly indicates that when it has left the area then upon returning to the area dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user would like their door unlocked as dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user approaches the door . A home threshold region is provided that can be adjusted larger to compensate for poor GPS positioning. As a non limiting example this can be caused when the dwelling user resource owner or end user is in a remote region and the like.

As dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user exits the dwelling user resource owner or end user the first and second geo fences and are exited. When this occurs after a certain time period the door is then locked. If the first geo fence is only exited system may not lock the door . The system server and or cloud based server can enable detailed GPS detection to verify that dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has left the area.

In one embodiment as dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end use renters the second geo fence an app on the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile device wakes up and examines a host of data to determine whether to activate Bluetooth of the mobile device and search for the door to unlock. As non limiting examples the data can include the amount of time spent outside the first or second geo fence respectfully time of day past dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user activity patterns motion data recorded device including driving activity walking or running activity WiFi access point information. The system server and or cloud based server can enable detailed GPS detection to verify that dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has returned home.

Using this information the system server and or cloud based server determines if dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is returning to the dwelling user resource owner or end user. The dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile device synthesizes configuration data which can include thresholds and probabilities with activity data on the system server and or cloud based server and determines if dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is returning to the dwelling user resource owner or end user. Mobile device can employ this logic multiple times over a period of time as input data changes to decide whether mobile device believes that the user is returning home.

The Bluetooth is activated on the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s mobile phone to search for the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user s dwelling user resource owner or end user lock. When the lock is detected the system server and or cloud based server connects to it establishes a secure connection unlocks door and notifies dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user via notification that door has been unlocked.

System receives notifications when dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has left and entered the area. Spurious location events are filtered out that could be erroneous due to environmental or technical glitches. As a non limiting example this can be a power outage. If the system sees that dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user has entered the home area less than a selected period of time a debounce signal from the system server and or cloud based server 90 seconds after entering then the system may discard it.

In one embodiment a debounce is provided by the system and or cloud based server such that dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user leaves and is outside a geo fence a second geo fence as described hereafter and the like for a selected period of time in order for an entrance to trigger a Bluetooth connection to the lock to unlock of door . With the debounce the dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user can leave come back quickly and then is not considered to have left the dwelling user resource owner or end user. The use of the debounce eliminates false unlocking of system when dwelling user resource owner or end user resource owner or end user is at the dwelling user resource owner or end user home and artifacts from cell tower WiFi and other systems that provide assistance providing location data are faulty and incorrectly assert that the user has left the dwelling user resource owner or end user.

In one embodiment intelligent door lock system is configured to have a remotely operable lock at a dwelling accessible by the user. The intelligent door lock system configured to be in communication with a server . The user communicates with the server using the user s mobile device and the server is configured to transmit a crossing notification message in response to tracking the user s mobile device and enable an automatic unlock feature of the lock using the server and a mobile device App.

In one embodiment a second geo fence is provided or the first geo fence is extended for early entrance detection. The second geo fence is larger than the first geo fence and can be of different geometric configurations. The second geo fence increases decreases and a combination of both the first geo fence . In one embodiment the second geo fence is adjustable . The second geo fence increases sensitivity

In another embodiment a map view position and radius adjustment is made. In this embodiment system does not unlock until after the mobile device owner has manually performed an unlock.

In one embodiment mobile device stores data over time as events occur. As non limiting examples this can include motion data geo fence regions exited or entered and the like. Any configuration of parameters from the server can be downloaded at any time as well. Each geo fence is associated with a lock or door . When a geo fence area has been entered the mobile device collects the history of crossing geo fences for that lock and creates a data set along with other live data including but not limited to WiFi access point data accumulated motion data during the time the user was outside a geo fence fence time of day and other information. That information is processed based on the configuration data producing a limited set of parameters types and associated values. These are fed to a decision making engine of mobile device which may be a Bayesian filter and the like that associates different probability value on each of these parameters and combines it to form a single yes no decision on whether the user desires its door is locked or unlocked. In the unlocked case the device enables Bluetooth and begins trying to connect to the dwelling user resource owner or end user lock. When the dwelling user resource owner or end user lock is connected the device unlocks door . In the case of the lock being bridged to the internet via Wireless access point Bluetooth is not used the mobile device connects to the bridge via Network system. The lock is then locked or unlocked remotely by mobile device using the Network System to a cloud service and or system backend that establishes a secure connection to the lock. In this embodiment there is a wall wart doorbell or another device that includes Bluetooth and is within an appropriate distance of door .

In one embodiment security system is an intelligent security system that produces fewer false alarms or alerts. In one embodiment security system uses motion detection device to look for an actual person which can be an outline of a person at or near the door or other entrance to the dwelling. If motion detection device with camera sees a person an outline of a person and the like an alert is sent to the dwelling user resource owner or end user mobile device . The dwelling user resource owner or end user views the video picture and the like taken by camera and has various options including but not limited to determine who is at the dwelling communicate with the person who is at the dwelling notify authorities of an unwanted person at the dwelling unlock or lock the dwelling including but not limited to door a window and the like in order to allow or deny access to the person.

In one embodiment intelligent security system is split into a plurality of parts. As a non limiting example intelligent security system can be split into i an intelligent security system used to wake up the motion detection device and prepare for a video call ii detect motion with or without person detection iii detect people at the dwelling without linger detection and iv detect people at the dwelling and linger.

As a non limiting example intelligent security system triggers motion detection device to wake up and turn on camera when motion is triggered. As a non limiting example one use of this capability is to prepare for a video call in response to a doorbell press. When motion is detected camera takes a still image to be used in a notification and make other preparations for a video call to the dwelling occupant in the event that the doorbell is pressed or the dwelling occupant initiates a video call in response to a motion person notification. As a non limiting example motion detection device does whatever is possible ahead of time to speed up the perceived connection time of notice to the dwelling occupant which can be a video call and the like

When the short range motion detection device is triggered the doorbell wakes up and camera takes a still image. A countdown to a timeout begins.

If the doorbell button is pressed before the timeout a doorbell press notification is sent to dwelling user resource owner or end user and a motion notification is not sent.

As a non limiting example mobile device OS motion notification can include the following text or equivalent Motion detected at at . The in app accept reject UI can be the same as for a button press except with the following differences i it can have the following text Motion detected at at ii it will display the still image taken by camera when it was awakened by the motion it detected iii red X and green check icons can remain the same but the labels below them can be Dismiss and View note the timeout can be a variety of different times. As a non limiting example it can be 5 10 second range although other ranges can be utilized iv a motion event can be put into an activity feed with the image taken in response to the motion and this can happen regardless of whether the dwelling user resource owner or end user responds to the notification.

In one embodiment if the dwelling user resource owner or end user taps View to initiate a video call an on demand video session can be put into the activity feed. In this embodiment there can be two events in the activity feed one for the motion and one for the video call.

In one embodiment toggle settings can be provided in settings to enable disable motion alerts. In one embodiment person notifications are provided. As a non limiting example the person notifications are sent to the dwelling user resource owner or end user.

As a non limiting example person detection can be based on whether there is a person in the frames captured by the camera which can be included with the doorbell as described above. As a non limiting example there is detection of via camera doorbell and the like. In one embodiment there is not checking that the same person is being detected in every frame captured by camera .

When either the long range or short range motion sensor is triggered camera doorbell wakes up takes a still image and initiates intelli vision analytics. Camera doorbell can continue taking still images save them and feed them to the server see .

If the doorbell button is pressed before the timeout a doorbell press notification can be sent and no motion or person notification is sent.

If the doorbell button is not pressed before the timeout either a motion notification or a person notification is sent.

If the analytics engine does not detect a person at any time during the timeout period a motion notification is sent as described above.

If the analytics engine does detect a person at any point during the timeout a person notification is sent.

In one embodiment the mobile device OS notification can have the following text Person detected at at . In one embodiment the in app accept reject UI is the same as for door bell press but may not have the following text Person detected at at . In one embodiment it can display the first image and the server analytics engine tags as containing a person. The red X and green check icons can remain the same but the labels below them can be Dismiss and View .

The timeout period is then selected. As a non limiting example this can be 5 10 seconds. It will be appreciated that other periods of time can be used for the timeout period.

In one embodiment Person events are placed in the Activity Feed the same way described above for motion events. In one embodiment the motion and person events are mutually exclusive. For a given activation of the intelligent security system a person event or motion event can be placed into the Activity Feed not both.

In one embodiment on demand video session events in the Activity Feed work the same as described above. As a non limiting example these events can include addition to motion person events.

In one embodiment there are two toggles in settings one to enable disable motion notifications and the other to enable disable person notifications. The defaults for these settings need to be determined. In one embodiment the person notifications can be on by default and motion notifications can be off by default.

In one embodiment Person Notifications only detects whether a frame contains a person. It does nothing to track a person from frame to frame or to determine if it s the same person in each frame. The result is that on a busy street where people frequently pass by the doorbell and or camera the person notification feature is triggered even though no one person is actually lingering in front of door . This issue can be addressed using the server analytics engine s ability to detect lingering. From a user perspective the feature can operate the same way and can surface the same settings. In one embodiment system only sends person notifications when we detect that the same person is lingering in front of the door window and the like. This provides better accuracy and fewer false person notifications.

In one embodiment camera is coupled to an analytics engine. The analytics engine includes a person detection module which wakes camera from the sleep state earlier.

In one embodiment intelligent security system has reduced latency. In one embodiment the reduced latency is achieved by the analytics engine person detection module. As a person approaches and comes to door or any dwelling available entrance including but not limited to a window and the like camera is activated with or with pressing the doorbell wakes up from a sleep mode and the intelligent security system is ready to go. Motion detection device with or without analytics engine wakes camera up from the sleep mode and when the person is at the entrance of the dwelling the camera is set to take a picture video with one or more frames and the like. This reduces latency and improves speed. As a non limiting example activation of camera integrated or not integrated with the doorbell from the pressing of the doorbell when the doorbell and camera are coupled and or integrated to the sending of a picture or video to a mobile device can be on the order of 30 seconds or less. This results from motion detection device starting recognition of a person or an object at an earlier time. When the person is at the dwelling entrance camera is then is set to start recording.

In one embodiment security system has reduced power consumption. In this embodiment the security system camera is only started up from its sleep state to a wake state when something passes by and or is in a selected distance relative to camera which is detected by. More particularly the person detection module is used along or without motion detection device to determine if something or someone passes by. In response to that determination if a person or something similar to a person passes by camera is awakened and put in an active state. This results in a savings of power because camera is in active step less often.

In one embodiment a server is in communication with the intelligent door lock system . In another embodiment instead of the intelligent door lock system a low power device that communicates with small payloads is used instead of the intelligent door lock system . In one embodiment low power means running off of consumer batteries. In one embodiment a small payload is 12 bytes or less. The server has a handshake key Kh with a key exchange that provides for a communication session between a mobile device and the intelligent door lock system . The mobile device does not have the Kh . A user mobile device is in communication with the server and uses a cipher to provide a secured communication between the mobile device and the intelligent door lock system .

In one embodiment an initialization is done when the intelligent door lock system and or the lock is created. In one embodiment communication is initialized by generating a session nonce Ns on the mobile device . In one embodiment the session nonce is encrypted using a handshake key Kh that is at the server . In one embodiment the Kh is a shared secret known to intelligent door lock system and to an entity encrypting the nonce that includes the server . In one embodiment the intelligent door lock system modifies the nonce and returns a modified value to the mobile device . In one embodiment

An entity with the server has the Kh decrypts a session key and the mobile device uses that to encrypt subsequent communication wherein the intelligent door lock system generates the session key and provides for an unlocking of a lock at the intelligent door lock system .

In one embodiment when the intelligent door lock system is assembled a random number is provisioned on the mobile device .

As a non limiting example the Kh is exchanged for a unit specific unit key Kh . As a non limiting example the Kh is a random number.

In one embodiment the server associates the Kh with a unique identification of a lock of the intelligent door lock system . In one embodiment the cloud service responds to the mobile device with a unit key encrypted using an open block cipher. As a non limiting example the server sends the Kh to the lock and the lock stores it in a non volatile memory with the Ku used as a handshake key. In one embodiment the mobile device generates two random numbers that are communicated with the server to create one half of the Kh . In response the server generates one or more random numbers to create a second half of the Kh . For each of session the server creates a different set of one or more numbers for the second half of the Kh .

In one embodiment in response to the server creating the second half of the Kh the mobile device functions without having the Kh 

In one embodiment the mobile device generates a checksum. In one embodiment the mobile device creates a request for a private communication and in response the server creates a second half of the Kh without the mobile device having the Kh . In response to transmission of the Kh a session is initiated that provides for unlocking of the door . A production of half of the Kh by the mobile device is an initiation of a request for packet for a private communication and thereafter a validation of a source is conducted.

As a non limiting example a third party mobile device never has on its mobile device an encryption for the intelligent door lock system .

Communication is initialized by generating a session nonce Ns on the mobile device . This session nonce is encrypted using a handshake key Kh . The handshake key is a shared secret known to the lock and to the entity encrypting the nonce. The lock then modifies the nonce and returns the modified value to the mobile device . The entity that has the handshake key then decrypts the session key and the mobile device uses that to encrypt subsequent communication.

When the lock is assembled a 16 byte key random number can be provisioned on the device. This key can be common to all locks of a given model and referred to as model key Km . The model key is a shared secret between the August API server and all locks of that model class. It can only be used at setup or factory reset time to exchange a new unit specific unit key Ku .

When the owner of the lock sets it up for the first time or after a factory reset of the lock the mobile application can generate a 16 byte random number and send it to the server . This number can be referred to as the unit key Ku . The API server associates the unit key with the unique ID of the lock. This is a shared secret between the lock and the service.

After associating the unit key with the lock the service responds to the mobile device with the unit key encrypted using AES CBC. The mobile device then sends this key to the lock and the lock stores it in non volatile memory. This unit key can be used as the handshake key Kh in future communications.

When a mobile device has authenticated against the August REST API and has been authorized to communicate with a particular lock it generates two 32 bit random values mRand1 and mRand2 which combined constitute the session nonce Ns .

The mobile device transmits the key to the low power device where data is validated. When the mobile device receives the encrypted key from the server it sends it to the lock. The lock then decrypts the message 

The lock now generates two 32 bit random values lRand1 lRand2 and a 32 bit lKeyCHecksum that is the 2s complement sum of lRand1 lRand2 and the 32 bit constant LX.

Mobile device transmits the encrypted key to service server which validates it. The mobile device sends lKeyExchange to the server which uses the unit ey to decrypt it 

If lKeyCheck is not zero the server returns an error to the mobile device and the mobile device disconnects from the lock. If lKeyCheck is zero the server returns lRand1 and lRand2 to the mobile device .

The mobile device then generates two 32 bit random values iRand2 and iRand2 as well as another 32 bit value iInitChecksum that is the twos complement of the two random values and a 32 bit constant IC 

The low power device validates an initialization command. When the lock receives the candidate session key from mobile device it generates its candidate session key lSK from the generated and shared random values and decrypts the message 

The low power device confirms the validity of the message by summing the four decrypted 32 bit values 

If iInitCheck is non zero or if IC does not match the expected value for IC the lock disconnects from the mobile device . If the message is valid communication is now considered secure buy the lock and future messages can be decrypted using Ks lSK.

The intelligent door lock now generates a 32 bit value rInitChecksum that is the twos compliment sum of the random values iRand1 iRand2 and a 32 bit constant RC.

If all of the conditions below are met communication is considered secure and future messages can be encrypted or decrypted with Ks mSK 

The security level defines the behavior of the service characteristics. When advertising the device is in the Not Connected state. After a connection is established the peripheral is in the Connected Not Secure state. After the handshake process is complete the device enters the Connected Secure state.
