This application is a continuation of pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13 953 459 filed on Jul. 29 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to displaying data on mobile devices in relation to physical locations and objects and more particularly to transmitting and caching data on mobile devices in relation to physical locations and objects likely to be identified and requested for display in mobile augmented reality applications.

Augmented reality AR applications present users with an augmented or enhanced view of a real world environment in which relevant content can be overlaid onto physical objects or points of interest located within the environment. For example a mobile AR application executable at a user s mobile device may overlay static or dynamic AR content related to various physical objects in the real world environment. Each physical object may be identified by the mobile AR application as a predefined target that can be represented digitally within a virtual AR environment displayed for the user via a display of the mobile device. The virtual AR environment and objects represented may be based on for example images of the real world environment captured by a digital camera integrated with the mobile device. Examples of different types of AR content that may be overlaid for an object in the real world e.g. identified as a target in the virtual AR world may include but are not limited to text images graphics or location information e.g. geographic location coordinates from a global positioning system GPS .

However conventional techniques for identifying targets within AR environments provided by mobile AR applications generally require a compromise between speed e.g. with respect to AR target identification and content delivery and efficiency e.g. with respect to memory usage for storing target data . For example speed may be increased by storing static target data for every identifiable target within a local memory of the mobile device. However this would place a significant burden on memory and other system resources particularly if the number of identifiable targets is extremely large e.g. over a million or billion targets .

Alternatively efficiency may be improved by offloading target identification operations to a server and or storing the target data in a remote storage location e.g. a cloud based data store which may be dynamically accessed by the mobile AR application via a communication network. However the speed of target identification at the mobile device may be significantly reduced due to for example data propagation delays or bandwidth issues in the network.

Thus such conventional solutions for target identification based on either static local data or dynamic data located remotely pose significant challenges to providing support for AR environments representing relatively more complex real world environments with large numbers of identifiable targets e.g. millions of targets related to individual consumer product items within a commercial business it becomes even more critical for the mobile AR application to quickly identify a large number targets while also maintaining an acceptable or desired level of responsiveness and overall system performance.

According to certain embodiments methods are disclosed for predicting potential targets to be identified in a mobile augmented reality application based on coincident targets identified previously and for predicting potential future targets for a user of a mobile augmented reality application based on high correlating targets identified during a session of user activity.

Additional objects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the disclosed embodiments. The objects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosed embodiments as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the disclosure examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

The present disclosure relates to streaming or otherwise transmitting target data for targets or future targets predicted to be potentially identified by a mobile AR application executable at a user s mobile device based on coincident requests for related targets previously identified during a session of user activity. The word target s is used herein to describe a virtual representation or identification of a real world i.e. physical object. In one embodiment an AR application server may stream or otherwise transmit the target data to a local AR cache within a memory of the mobile device. The local AR cache may be one or more predefined or dynamically allocated memory blocks of any size which may be reserved for storing target data. The mobile AR application in this example may be configured to identify targets corresponding to physical objects to be represented within an AR environment accessed based on the target data stored within the local AR cache at the mobile device.

For example in some cases a user may be in a particular real world environment and may be encountering one or more real world objects such as a product a printed article of content an electronic display of content a location etc. The user may scan or otherwise request AR data associated with the particular object in the real world environment. According to certain aspects of the present disclosure the user s electronic device may cause an AR server to begin predicting based on the identity and other aspects of the scanned objects what other future objects the user might scan. Accordingly the AR server may preemptively stream or otherwise send to the user s device the AR data associated with the one or more future targets that the AR server predicts the user will likely soon encounter and scan to request associated AR data.

As will be described in further detail below the virtual AR environment and objects represented may correspond to a current view of the real world based on images captured by a digital camera integrated with the mobile device and displayed for the user via a display of the mobile device. A physical object in the real world may correspond to a predefined reference marker or target in the virtual AR world provided for the user by the mobile AR application at the mobile device. AR content associated with a physical object or predefined AR target may include for example and without limitation text images graphics or location information e.g. geographic location coordinates from a global positioning system GPS and or textual image video or audio advertisements s or sponsored content.

As shown in in one embodiment the user environment may include a first zone having a plurality of objects and a second zone having a plurality of objects and each of the objects may be identifiable by a mobile device . According to certain aspects of the present disclosure a user may operate a mobile application executed on mobile device to request and obtain virtual or AR data associated with one or more of objects . As described above the present disclosure is directed to improving both the speed and efficiency at which the user s device may request and obtain such virtual or AR data. For example if a user requests AR data for an object an associated AR server may determine that the user is more likely to subsequently request AR data for another one of objects within zone and therefore preemptively stream data associated with each of objects to the user s device . Likewise if a user requests AR data for an object an associated AR server may determine that the user is more likely to subsequently request AR data for another one of objects within zone and therefore preemptively stream data associated with each of objects to the user s device .

Although depicts zones and as physical zones defined by space it should be appreciated that zones may alternatively be subject matter categories product types stores brands etc. Of course instead of preemptively streaming data associated with an entire zone the associated AR server might preemptively stream data associated with only a subset of the similar objects to the user e.g. for those objects for which a user is statistically more likely to request AR data in the near future . Moreover the associated AR server may preemptively stream any desired amount of data associated with any desired number of predicted future objects i.e. AR targets . For example the associated AR server may preemptively stream to a user s device the AR data associated with the N next objects the user is most likely to scan or otherwise request regardless of which zone such objects may exist within.

As depicted in user devices may include for example a mobile phone a mobile device a tablet and or a laptop computer or server . In one embodiment user devices may be owned and used by one or more people who may be viewers of web pages and or consumers of content over the Internet either through an application mobile browser or web browser stored on respective user devices. User devices may include any type of electronic device configured to send and receive data such as websites multimedia content and electronic advertisements over electronic network . For example each of user devices may include a mobile device smartphone personal digital assistant PDA a navigation device a portable game console personal computer laptop server or any combination of these computing devices or other types of mobile computing devices having at least one processor a local memory a display one or more user input devices and a network communication interface disposed in communication with electronic network .

Each of user devices may have a web browser and or mobile browser installed for receiving and displaying electronic content received from one or more web servers. Each of user devices may have an operating system configured to execute a web or mobile browser and any type of application such as a mobile application. In one embodiment user devices may be configured to download applications and or application content from application servers. In one embodiment user devices may be configured to download one or more augmented reality mobile applications from a mobile application server and execute those one or more augmented reality applications to receive and manipulate electronic augmented reality content received from one or more of web servers and or content distribution servers.

As shown in the environment may include one or more augmented reality and or advertising servers one or more vendor and or third party augmented reality servers and one or more auxiliary augmented reality servers . The one or more server systems may include any type of web server service or any other type of web resource that may be accessed by one or more of user devices and or each other. Specifically the one or more server systems may represent any of various types of servers including but not limited to a web server an application server a proxy server a network server or a server farm. The one or more server systems may be implemented using any general purpose computer capable of serving data to user devices or any other computing devices not shown via network . Such other computing devices may include but are not limited to any device having a processor and memory for executing and storing instructions. Software may include one or more applications and an operating system. Hardware may include but is not limited to a processor e.g. processors a memory device e.g. databases and modules of graphical user interface s GUIs and or application programming interface s APIs . The computing device may also have multiple processors and multiple shared or separate memory components. For example the computing device may be a clustered computing environment or server farm.

While only servers are shown additional servers may be used as desired. Similarly while only user devices are shown network environment may include for any number of users additional user devices that also may be configured to communicate with servers via network . Network can be any network or combination of networks that can carry data communication. Network may include but is not limited to a local area network medium area network and or wide area network such as the Internet. Any or all of the devices and or servers may be disposed in communication with an electronic network such as the Internet. Moreover any pair of the devices and or servers may be configured to exchange data packets over the electronic network according to any suitable predetermined protocol such as hypertext transfer protocol HTTP . Any or all of the devices and or servers may be configured to perform various techniques for exchanging requests for data responses to requests for data and data in manners so as to transmit and cache data on mobile devices in relation to physical locations and objects likely to be identified and targeted for display in mobile augmented reality applications.

As shown in server systems may each include or be provided in communication with one or more databases . Databases may be any type of database or data repository for storing data accessible by server systems . Although only databases are shown additional databases may be used as desired. As will be described in further detail below databases may be used to store for example data related to various targets representing physical real world objects in a mobile AR application e.g. a client application executable at each of user devices . Also as will be described in further detail below server systems in this example may be an application server configured to serve target data for potential targets to be identified for a user of client application at each of user devices . In a further example a client application may provide an interface at each of user devices for acquiring data or executable software instructions from an associated AR application or service hosted at servers via network .

As shown in the embodiment of user device may include a client application and a memory . Client application in this example may be mobile AR application executable at user device . Client application may be implemented as for example a standalone application or it can be executed within a web browser at user device as for example a browser plug in or script that executes within the browser. As shown in client application may be configured to communicate via network with an associated AR application or service hosted at server in order to provide AR functionality to a user of client application at user device .

In the example shown in client application may include a graphical user interface GUI and a target identifier . GUI may be adapted to provide a virtual representation of a real world environment including AR content related to one or more physical objects or points of interest located within the real world environment via a display e.g. a touch screen display of user device . As described above such a virtual AR environment may be based on for example an image or video captured by a digital camera not shown that may be coupled to or integrated with user device . The captured image s may be of a single object or a real world scene including multiple objects. In addition the captured image may be for example and without limitation a barcode such as a Universal Product Code UPC QR Code or other type of machine readable or coded symbol that uniquely identifies a physical object and is generally imprinted on the object itself or a label attached to the object. In some implementations user device may include a barcode scanner for scanning such a coded symbol.

Target identifier in this example may be adapted to identify targets corresponding to the physical object s or point s of interest within a captured image of the real world environment. The targets identified by target identifier may be based on for example target data stored in an AR cache of local memory . As described above the target data stored in AR cache may have been obtained from server via network . In an example target identifier may detect an object within the real world environment and attempt to find matching target data stored within AR cache .

In some implementations target data stored within AR cache may include for example information associated with a corresponding physical object within the real world environment. Such information may include for example a definition of characteristic features or physical parameters associated with the object in the real world which may be used by target identifier to recognize the object detected in the real world environment as a target within an AR environment. This information may also be used to generate a visual representation of the physical object or target within the virtual AR environment. As described above the AR environment and objects represented within the AR environment may be displayed by for example GUI via a display of user device . According to certain aspects of the present disclosure if target identifier in the above example does not find target data within AR cache that matches the detected object target identifier may send a request for the matching target data to server via network .

As shown in in one embodiment the server may include among other modules and devices a content manager a target identifier and or a target classifier . Of course server may include other modules and devices and server may share the functions of content manager target identifier and or target classifier across other servers such as server systems of . The content manager target identifier and or target classifier may be software modules executed by processor of servers or may alternatively be separate or integrated processing devices themselves. The content manager may be configured to receive and aggregate AR content e.g. ads text images etc. from any of the database s database s the vendor third party AR target server s and auxiliary server s . In one embodiment server s may also include a request manager configured to receive over network one or more requests from a user s mobile device for target data related to one or more physical objects within an image of a real world environment captured at the mobile device.

In one embodiment the target identifier may be configured to identify a current target representing the physical object within a virtual environment corresponding to the real world environment based on the one or more requests received at the server s e.g. by the request manager. The target classifier may be configured to identify coincident target requests related to a request received in relation to each current target such as based on a log of prior requests for targets identified during a session of user activity and determine at least one potential future target to be identified at the mobile device based on the identified targets related to the current target. Server s may also include a data manager configured to send to user device over network target data corresponding to each of the current target and the potential future target based on the determination by the target classifier. The user device may be configured to provide a visual representation of the current target within the virtual environment based on the corresponding target data and store the target data for the potential future target in a local memory of the device.

As shown in the embodiment of method may include a user device scanning or photographing an image or barcode of a target step . For example a user may use a mobile device to request target data for a physical object or location. For example a user may approach one or more physical objects and desire to view additional virtual data e.g. photo s textual description s pricing information related URL s audio recording s discount codes coupons nutritional info recipes etc. regarding those objects. In one embodiment the user may request data relating to the object by obtaining a photograph of the object using device . Alternatively the user may execute an application of the device to perform image and or textual recognition of the object and or to read or decode a one or two dimensional barcode or other identifying indicia on the object.

Method may then include checking for data related to the identified target on the user s device e.g. in cache or other local memory step . For example upon the user s device recognizing the object and or identifying a target ID associated with the object or location in proximity of the user s device the device may look up the target ID in the cache or local memory to obtain any stored AR target data associated with the target ID. At any time before after or during transmission of any image barcode or other identifying information from the user device to the AR server the user s device may display any non dynamic target content that is retrieved in relation to the image or barcode data step . That is if at step the user device finds related AR target data while performing a local check for that data the device may display that AR target data to the user. For example the user device may display an electronic reproduction of the physical object e.g. as through a viewfinder of the user s device and overlaid on that electronic reproduction also display one or more virtual data items e.g. photo s textual description s pricing information related URL s advertisements etc. .

As described above at any time before during or after checking for and or displaying locally stored related AR data method may include sending an image barcode data or other identifying information about the object or the target of the object to the AR server step . Thus the AR server e.g. server systems may receive the image barcode or other identifying information from the user device step . Regardless of whether the user s device found locally stored non dynamic target AR data to display to the user upon receiving the image barcode or other identifying information from the user device the AR server may look up and send AR data related to the identified target back to the user device step . For example as shown in the augmented reality and or advertising server systems may maintain a database of AR targets AR target IDs and related target data for any number of physical objects. Of course it should be appreciated that although only depicts six exemplary targets with associated target IDs and related data in operation the databases may store data associated with millions tens of millions or billions of different objects such as different products digital items people consumer devices tourist attractions content items etc. Thus as shown in augmented reality and or advertising server systems may be provided in communication with one or both of the vendor third party AR target server s and the auxiliary AR server s . Thus while looking up AR target IDs and related target data for any given AR target or object the augmented reality and or advertising server systems may additionally issue requests to the vendor third party AR target server s and or the auxiliary AR server s for AR target IDs and related target data. As shown in any of those databases may store for any given target of a physical object or location a target ID e.g. A B etc. and perhaps some textual data e.g. A a photo graphic recording etc. e.g. A and or a URL or other Internet object e.g. A .

Upon retrieving related AR data related to the target the AR server may send the related information back to the user s device e.g. over electronic network and any related cellular Wi Fi or other networks such that the user s device may receive and store the related information on local memory for presentation to the user step . Of course the user s device may present the related AR target data received from the server to the user using any known means such as by presenting textual and or visual imagery data to the user on a display or touchscreen displaying data overlaid on top of a digital representation of the physical object or location displaying the data on a map of the location or target and or playing an audio sound etc.

As the user continues to encounter various physical objects or locations as desired the user may continue to selectively scan decode photograph or otherwise request AR data associated with those targets and therefore continue to repeat steps . That is the user s device may continue to check the local cache or memory for related data step and if necessary request such data from the AR server step . In some cases the user s device may have stored therein some non dynamic AR data related to the identified object whereas in others the AR server may send the user s device dynamic or non dynamic AR data related to the identified object.

According to certain aspects of the present disclosure when the AR server looks up and sends to the user device some information related to the identified object or location the AR server may perform additional steps for performing predictions of objects and locations likely to be requested by the user in the near future. For example in one embodiment the AR server may perform the steps of logging co incident requests from the user device step identifying one or more high scoring targets correlating to the co incident requests step and streaming or otherwise sending to the user device information related to the one or more high scoring targets step . In other words the AR server may determine what one or more targets the user is likely to scan next and preemptively stream AR data relating to those predicted targets to the user s device before the user has scanned such objects.

Specifically in one embodiment each time AR server receives an AR data request step and looks up and sends related AR data to user s device step the AR server may also store in a database e.g. databases information related to the request including e.g. the identity of the user making the request the time of the request the contents of the request e.g. photo barcode etc. and or the data that was retrieved and sent back to the user s device in response to the request step . Accordingly the AR server may generate a log of user requests which may be indexed and searchable by user target ID timestamps categories etc.

The AR server may then at any time during method identify high scoring targets correlating to the co incident requests step . is a process flowchart of an exemplary method for predicting potential targets to be streamed or otherwise transmitted to the mobile AR application of . As shown in method may include filtering the target request log e.g. generated at step for coincident target requests related to the current or last requested target step . Method may further include calculating one or more probabilities that various potential future targets will be requested based on an evaluation of the coincident target requests step using any suitable formula or algorithm such as a machine learning algorithm and or an artificial intelligence algorithm. For example in one embodiment the AR server may determine the N objects the user is most likely to scan or otherwise request next. In one embodiment the AR server may determine based on historical information such as the created log of co incident requests the statistical likelihood that the user will request AR data for any particular AR target. In a database of millions of targets for 99 of the targets the likelihood of a user s subsequent selection of that respective target within some preset time period might be less than 0.01 . However for some small subset of targets there might be a 10 or maybe even 50 chance that the user will request AR data for those targets. As described above with respect to the simplified example of if a user has already requested AR data for three of the four objects in zone the AR server might determine that there is a 50 chance that the user will next request AR data for the fourth and final object in zone .

Method may further include ranking the targets from coincident requests according to the calculated probabilities step . For example the AR server might identify for example the N number of targets e.g. 10 20 50 100 etc. for which there is at least some X threshold likelihood e.g. 20 50 70 that the user will request AR data for that target within a threshold amount of time T e.g. 10 min 1 hour 24 hours etc. . In one embodiment the qualifying targets may be ranked in order and or scored for likelihood of subsequent selection. Method may further include retrieving target data associated with high ranking coincident requests step for sending back to the user device. For example in one embodiment the content manager of server s may retrieve AR target data of the identified AR targets from one or more of database s database s the vendor third party AR target server s and auxiliary server s .

In one embodiment a portion of the local memory at the mobile device may be dedicated as a target data cache for use in target identification by the client application based on real world objects detected at the mobile device during the current session. In one embodiment the identification of targets and high ranking coincident targets may be based on previously identified targets of prior requests received during one or more previous sessions of user activity. For example the previous sessions may correlate to a current geographic location of the mobile device during the current session. The current and potential future targets may be associated with a target category according to one or more predetermined correlation parameters. The predetermined correlation parameters may include location time target type user ID e.g. where a higher score is generated for past target requests by the same user relative to past requests from other users to account for individual patterns or behavioral characteristics of different users . The analysis of coincident requests may include identifying coincident target requests received from same or different users within a predetermined period of time during the current session. The current session may be any predetermined period of activity associated with one or multiple users of the AR application content delivery service.

For example in one embodiment a current session may be a single session of user activity by the same user e.g. where a single session for a user may correspond to a period of time starting from when the user launches the app at the device then performs some activity such that a target request is received by the server and the server logs the request and ending when the user closes the app or discontinues use for a certain period of time e.g. no indication of user activity is received at the server for a predetermined period of time . In one embodiment the server may be configured to log only those user requests received during the current session. As such the number of requests logged for the user or user s device may vary depending on how a current session is defined. For example the current session may be any number of usage sessions over a predetermined period of time by the same user one or more distinct predetermined time period of usage or user activity by the same user e.g. limited to each usage of application where only target requests occurring during a single usage session are logged. Alternatively a user session may include any target request received from the same user s device within the same hour day week etc. In yet another embodiment a user session may take into consideration the AR requests for any user across any device over any past amount of time.

In one embodiment coincident requests or AR targets may be determined based on event logs stored at the device and accessible by server or received in the target request or stored at the server for each user mobile device server may assign a unique user device ID for each registered user device and maintain a target request history or session log for the user device based on user activity interaction with the AR app at the device.

In one embodiment the AR server may perform a statistical analysis of usage data across multiple users for relevant time period to determine usage target scan patterns which may be used to determine predict targets that are likely to be scanned in the future. Such a statistical analysis may be individualized for the current user based on preferences specified by the user through the AR app or account info registered for the user or device at the server. In another embodiment the determination of previous targets correlating to a current target may be performed based on the generated request log with coincident requests being from same user or different users for target requests received during a current session of user activity depending on the definition of current session . In one embodiment the AR application may be configured to send automatic notifications e.g. as a background process to the server based on user interaction with a GUI of the AR app.

Method may further including streaming or otherwise sending from the AR server to the user device any information relating to the identified high scoring targets step . In one embodiment the identified AR data for the identified or predicted AR targets may be retrieved from another location such as from vendor third party AR target server s and or auxiliary AR server s . In any event one or more AR servers may transmit the identified and retrieved AR data for the predicted AR targets to the user device over electronic network including over any related cellular and or Wi Fi network. Thus the user s device may receive and store in cache or local memory the information related to the one or more high scoring targets step . Because the user may or may not request AR data for the targets for which the user device preemptively received related AR data it may be advantageous for the user device to execute an expiration policy to delete undesired or unused information or AR data from the user s device cache or memory step .

As described above the computer system may include any type or combination of computing systems such as handheld devices personal computers servers clustered computing machines and or cloud computing systems. In one embodiment the computer system may be an assembly of hardware including a memory a central processing unit CPU and or optionally a user interface. The memory may include any type of RAM or ROM embodied in a physical storage medium such as magnetic storage including floppy disk hard disk or magnetic tape semiconductor storage such as solid state disk SSD or flash memory optical disc storage or magneto optical disc storage. The CPU may include one or more processors for processing data according to instructions stored in the memory. The functions of the processor may be provided by a single dedicated processor or by a plurality of processors. Moreover the processor may include without limitation digital signal processor DSP hardware or any other hardware capable of executing software.

Program aspects of the technology may be thought of as products or articles of manufacture typically in the form of executable code and or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Storage type media include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers processors or the like or associated modules thereof such as various semiconductor memories tape drives disk drives and the like which may provide non transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications for example may enable loading of the software from one computer or processor into another for example from a management server or host computer of the mobile communication network into the computer platform of a server and or from a server to the mobile device. Thus another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical electrical and electromagnetic waves such as used across physical interfaces between local devices through wired and optical landline networks and over various air links. The physical elements that carry such waves such as wired or wireless links optical links or the like also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein unless restricted to non transitory tangible storage media terms such as computer or machine readable medium refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution.
