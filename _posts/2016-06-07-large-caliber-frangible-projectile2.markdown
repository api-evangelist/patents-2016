The present application is a division of and claims the benefit of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 848 627 filed Sep. 9 2015 which is a divisional of and claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 015 079 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9 212 876. The specification and drawings of each of these applications are specifically incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in their entirety.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to large caliber gun launched projectiles.

Large caliber projectiles are generally 60 mm caliber and larger. Historically the nose portions of large caliber projectiles have been manufactured from high strength 4340 Steel heat treated to 120 ksi yield strength. The hardened high strength steel nose renders the projectile susceptible to ricochet. The high strength steel does not fragment on impact and can travel several kilometers after initial impact.

At munitions testing and training sites berms are used to protect engagement targets and backstops located behind the targets are used to contain the projectiles. In the past testing and training exercises conducted with high strength steel projectiles were not an issue because the projectiles had a relatively low initial velocity and relatively low mass resulting in low impact energy. The use of berms and backstops at the testing and training areas was sufficient to protect targets and contain the fired projectiles.

More recently large caliber projectiles made of high strength steel have higher initial velocity and greater mass. Therefore the impact energy of the projectiles is greater than in the past. The existing berms and backstops may no longer be sufficient to protect targets and contain fired projectiles. One solution is to expand the area of the Surface Danger Zone SDZ at training sites. However the additional real estate needed for an expanded SDZ is not always readily available. Another solution is to frequently rebuild the berms and backstops at a considerable cost.

A solution is needed to prevent stray projectiles at testing and training areas and to minimize damage to berms and backstops.

One aspect of the invention is a frangible training projectile for a large caliber gun. The projectile includes a generally cylindrical base portion and a generally conical portion contiguous with the base portion. The base portion and the conical portion have a common central longitudinal axis and are made of steel having a yield strength of at least 60 ksi. At least three longitudinal slits are formed in the base and conical portions. The slits are equally spaced circumferentially. Each slit extends from a bottom surface of the base portion through the base portion and into the conical portion. Each pair of adjacent slits defines a projectile section therebetween. Upon impact of the projectile the projectile sections break away from a central core. The projectile may be made from a single monolithic piece of material.

The radial extent of each slit in the bottom surface may be at least one half of the radius of the bottom surface. The central core may be substantially a right circular cylinder.

Another aspect of the invention is a frangible training projectile for a large caliber gun wherein the projectile has a generally cylindrical base portion and a generally conical portion adjacent to the base portion. The base portion and the conical portion have a common central longitudinal axis. A rod is centered on the longitudinal axis and extends the entire length of the projectile. The rod has a nose end and a circumferential shoulder formed at the nose end. The base portion includes a bottommost member having an opening for the rod. A plurality of discrete segments are disposed between the bottommost member of the base portion and the circumferential shoulder of the nose end. Upon impact of the projectile the plurality of discrete segments separates from the rod and the bottommost member of the base portion.

The rod may include at least one circumferential notch formed therein. The opening in the bottommost member may include threads that engage threads on the rod. The number of discrete segments is at least three. The rod the bottommost member and the plurality of discrete segments may be made of steel having a yield strength of at least 60 ksi.

In one embodiment each discrete segment may be centered on the common central longitudinal axis and disposed in axial succession from the bottommost member to the nose end of the rod. Each discrete segment may include a central opening through which the rod extends.

In another embodiment each discrete segment is a wedge that extends longitudinally from the circumferential shoulder to the bottommost member and radially from an outer surface of the projectile to the rod. The number of wedges is an odd number.

Each pair of adjacent wedges may form a longitudinal abutment line at the outer surface of the projectile and the projectile may include a weld along at least a portion of each longitudinal abutment line. The wedges and the bottommost member may form a bottom circumferential abutment line at the outer surface of the projectile and the projectile may include a weld along at least a portion of the bottom circumferential abutment line. The wedges and the circumferential shoulder may form a nose circumferential abutment line at the outer surface of the projectile and the projectile may include a weld along at least a portion of the nose circumferential abutment line.

In another aspect the invention encompasses a frangible training projectile for a large caliber gun wherein the projectile has a solid generally cylindrical base and a hollow cap that is fixed to and closed by the base. The hollow cap has a cylindrical portion a conical portion and an interior. The base and the hollow cap have a common central longitudinal axis. A mixture fills the interior of the hollow cap. The mixture includes a plurality of particles dispersed and encapsulated in a rigid potting medium. The particles are made of a material having a density greater than the density of steel. Upon impact of the projectile the hollow cap separates from the base and the mixture forms a plurality of fragments.

The cylindrical portion of the hollow cap may include internal threads that engage external threads on the base. The base and the hollow cap may be made of steel having a yield strength of at least 60 ksi.

An additional aspect of the invention is a frangible training projectile for a large caliber gun wherein the projectile has a generally cylindrical base portion and a generally conical portion adjacent to the base portion. The base portion and the conical portion have a common central longitudinal axis and are made of steel having a yield strength of at least 60 ksi. A central blind bore is centered on the common central longitudinal axis. The bore begins on a bottom surface of the base portion and extends into the conical portion. Upon impact of the projectile the conical and base portions form a plurality of fragments.

The projectile may include at least two lateral blind bores having longitudinal axes parallel to the common central longitudinal axis. The at least two lateral blind bores are equally spaced apart circumferentially and located radially the same distance from the common central longitudinal axis. The at least two lateral blind bores begin on the bottom surface of the base portion and extend into the conical portion.

The projectile may include a steel rod disposed in the central blind bore. Steel rods may also be disposed in two or more of the at least two lateral blind bores.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel large caliber frangible training projectile breaks up into fragments on impact. The frangible projectile must however be strong enough to withstand the large caliber gun environment including set back forces pressure and heat. In general to withstand the gun environment the material used to fabricate the novel frangible projectile has a yield strength of at least 60 ksi.

The properties of the frangible training projectile that are important for training purposes are as close as possible to the properties of the corresponding tactical projectile. These properties include one or more of the tactical projectile s weight center of gravity length and external ballistics.

The mass of the frangible projectile is broken into several fragments upon impact. The fragmentation reduces the projectile velocity increases its surface area and increases its resistance to movement. The fragmentation results in a reduction of projectile energy. The frangible training projectile will limit the SDZ as well as minimize damage to berms and backstops.

To enable fragmentation at impact some embodiments of the frangible projectile are partially or entirely made of a material with a lower yield strength than the material used in the counterpart tactical projectile. Some embodiments of the frangible projectile may include portions that are sectioned welded or provided with stress risers. Some embodiments of the frangible projectile may include high density particles suspended in a weaker medium. These fragmentation methods may be applied to the overall mass of the projectile or to a portion of the projectile such as the portion with the largest mass of the projectile. The portion with the largest mass may be in some cases the nose of the projectile.

At least three longitudinal slits are formed in base and conical portions . In five slits are shown although more than five slits may be present. The number of slits should be an odd number. Slits are equally spaced circumferentially in projectile . Each slit extends from a bottom surface of base portion through base portion and into conical portion . Each pair of adjacent slits defines a projectile section therebetween.

Projectile may be formed from a single monolithic piece of material. Slots may be formed using for example a saw. In some embodiments of projectile the radial extent b of each slit measured from the perimeter of bottom surface inwardly toward the center of bottom surface is at least one half of the radius r of bottom surface . As shown in the radial extent b is at least 75 of the radius r. In some embodiments of projectile the axial extent c of each slit is at least one half the length d of projectile . As shown in the axial extent c is at least 75 of the length d.

Upon impact of projectile rod will break. The discrete segments will separate from each other from rod and from bottommost member . The use of notches will cause rod to more easily break.

In some embodiments rod bottommost member and the plurality of discrete segments are made of steel having a yield strength of at least 60 ksi.

In each discrete segment is centered on common central longitudinal axis E and is disposed in axial succession from bottommost member to nose end of rod . Each discrete segment includes a central opening through which rod extends. Adjacent discrete segments may include interlocking features. For example segment includes slots that mate with projections on bottommost member . Segments and have mating angled contact surfaces. Segment includes slots that mate with projections on segment

In projectile each discrete segment is a wedge that extends longitudinally from circumferential shoulder to bottommost member and radially from the outer surface of projectile inwardly to rod . Upon impact of projectile rod will break. The discrete segments will separate from each other from rod and from bottommost member . The use of notches may enable rod to break more easily.

Each pair of adjacent wedge segments forms a longitudinal abutment line at the outer surface of projectile . The wedge segments and bottommost member form a bottom circumferential abutment line at the outer surface of projectile . The wedge segments and circumferential shoulder form a nose circumferential abutment line at the outer surface of projectile .

In some embodiments of projectile adjacent wedge segments may be welded together along all or a portion of longitudinal abutment lines wedge segments and bottommost member may be welded together along all or a portion of bottom circumferential abutment line and wedge segments and rod may be welded together along all or a portion of nose circumferential line . Upon impact of projectile the welds on the abutment lines will break and segments will separate from each other and from rod and bottommost member .

A mixture fills interior of hollow cap . Mixture includes a plurality of particles dispersed and encapsulated in a rigid potting medium . An example of a potting medium is epoxy. Particles are made of a material having a density greater than the density of steel for example tungsten or lead or other dense materials. One preferred shape for particles is spherical. Upon impact of projectile hollow cap separates from base and mixture forms a plurality of fragments. Mixture will easily fragment on impact because potting medium is a relatively weak material compared to particles .

Central blind bore may extend axially over half the overall length of projectile . Lateral blind bores are preferably all the same diameter and length. The diameter of lateral blind bores is less than the diameter of central blind bore . A rod may be disposed in central blind bore . Rod may be made of for example steel. Rods may be disposed in pairs of radially opposite lateral blind bores . Rods may be made of for example steel.
