The present invention relates to physical exercise machines and more particularly to an exercise apparatus that enables users to perform simulated walking running or other back and forth leg movement exercise that is resisted by a resistance mechanism.

Exercise machines for simulating walking or running are known and used for directing the movement of a user s legs and feet in a variety of repetitive paths of travel. The user typically performs an exercise using such a walking or running machine for an extended period of time such as one to 30 minutes without interruption and without stopping to perform a different exercise using a different machine such as a user might perform in a circuit protocol of exercise. The machines typically include an electrically powered mechanism that the user can activate to adjust some aspect of the machine such as degree of resistance. Running or walking simulation machines commonly referred to as elliptical path machines have been designed to pivot the foot pedals on which the user s feet reside guiding the pedals and the user s feet to travel in an elliptical or arcuate path. The degree of resistance to performance of the exercise in such prior art machines typically varies linearly with the degree of force or speed exerted by the user to a moving mechanical component of the apparatus. The path of travel of the foot pedal in such prior machines is not adjustable other than to change the shape of the ellipse. The foot travels along a different path from back to front than from front to back in such elliptical machines.

As shown in a detector D can be used to detect any one or more movements or properties of the apparatus or the user or a component of the apparatus such as the speed and time of rotation or other movement of the resistance assembly in the case of the embodiments a fan . The speed detector can comprise an optical detector a magnetic field detector a Hall effect sensor a potentiometer one or more limit switches or any other detector that is capable of sensing a relevant measurable movement rotational translational or the like of a mechanical element or component of a relevant mechanical element such as a wheel like fan wheel an axle like crankshaft a belt like belts a pulley like pulleys a foot support like supports a support pivot arm like arms or any other moving element of the apparatus the rate of movement of which can be converted by an algorithm to the output results desired to be displayed on a visual display on the display area of the user interface . The rate of movement or property detected by the detector D is generically designated as FR in for purposes of explanation it being understood that FR can alternatively comprise a value indicative of a movement other than the rotational speed of the fan wheel that can be used in an algorithm to generate a calculation of a result indicative the mechanical power or work input into the resistance assembly a result such as power energy velocity strides per minute distance of movement by foot or by a bicycle of predetermined configuration.

As shown the detector D sends a signal indicative of FR to the processor which processes the signal according to a predetermined algorithm to calculate a value indicative of any desired aspect of the user s performance of exercise or the result of the user s exertion of force or energy in performance of the back and forth movement of the foot pedals of the apparatuses shown in . In the examples of the algorithm included in the processor is designed to use the variable input of FR to calculate for example the number of watts of power exerted by the user the number of meters that the user would have traveled if riding a bicycle having a preselected configuration while generating such power as calculated from FR and the number of strides per minute that the user would have achieved exerting the power or force calculated by the algorithm based on the FR input as a variable to the algorithm. Where the rotational speed of the fan wheel is sensed and used in an algorithm other values or parameters peculiar to the wheel such as the number size and shape of fan blades are included in the algorithm in order to generate a value for the moment of inertia of fan wheel alternatively the value for the moment of inertia may be provided to the algorithm in advance in the form of a static variable the moment of inertia being used to calculate the desired result such as watts power energy work distance traveled number of strides and the like. As can be readily imagined one or more additional or different detectors could alternatively be used to sense a rotational or translational movement and send a signal to processor that is indicative of the speed or velocity of such movement such as of a shaft a belt a pulley a foot support a support pivot arm and a signal indicative of such movements could be used in an appropriate algorithm to generate and display one or more visual results indicative of watts energy or power exerted by the user number of meters that the user would have traveled if riding a bicycle number of strides per minute and the like.

The aforementioned algorithm can include instructions that carry out a mathematical compensation that accounts for the effects of air temperature and pressure dependencies in the determination of the mechanical power expressed by the rotation of fan wheel . While the derivation of a power figure based on a measurement of the angular or rotational velocity of a spinning fan is generally known in the art such calculations assume a constant value for the density of the surrounding air. Pressure and temperature sensors not shown can provide additional inputs to the processor allowing a real time and accurate measurement of air density to be made and used in the algorithm that generates the desired output results for display on the user interface. For a gas such as air the relationship between the pressure P volume V and temperature T exhibits a known and mathematically predictable relationship generally approximated via the Ideal Gas Law. It may be further derived that density is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas and inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore the use of temperature and pressure sensor readings and inputs to processor can enable a calculation of air density for purposes of calculating a more accurate value for the power generated by rotation of fan blade .

Movable connectors and rotatably couple rear linkages and respectively to upper supports or links and . Other connection assemblies that permit similar motion are contemplated by the invention.

As shown in the screw has a crank or wheel handle connected to a proximal end of the screw that is mounted so as to be readily manually accessible and engageable by a user located in the user disposition region of the apparatus . The handle is readily rotatable or turnable by hand by a typical human user so as enable the user to readily effect rotation T of the screw to any desired degree of rotation quickly and immediately upon manual engagement. The screw is screwably engaged at distal position with a screw receiving bracket or nut that is attached to the mounting bracket or arm such that when the screw is rotated either counterclockwise or clockwise the bracket or arm will pivot back and forth FB a selectable distance depending on the degree of rotation T of the screw. In the same manner as described below with reference to the manually drivable piston embodiments of the degree of such pivoting back and forth FB of bracket or arm as determined by the degree and direction of rotation T of screw enables the user to selectively change the identity of the particular arc segment through which the foot pedals will travel when the pedals are driven between a forwardmost upward and rearwardmost downward position. Depending on the particular arc segment chosen by the user the degree of incline of the foot pedals and thus the degree of difficulty of driving the foot pedals back and forth will vary. As shown in the bracket or arm is disposed in a first generally vertical disposition similar to the disposition shown in where the horizontal component of the force F required is FH and vertical component of the force F required to move the foot pedals is FV. As shown in the screw has been turned T such that the bracket or arm is now disposed at an angle A relative to the position of similar to the difference in arm and foot pedal positions between and and the horizontal FH and FV components of force required to drive the foot pedals through the new arc segment associated with the new pivoted position A of the bracket or arm has changed relative to the position of the arm in and thus degree of difficulty of the force F needed to perform an exercise cycle has been selectively changed by the user.

In each of the embodiments described herein the arc segment selection device is manually actuatable by the user to exert a selectable amount of manual force on the selection device that operates to selectively position vary or adjust the resistance assembly in or to any one of a plurality of predetermined fixed mechanical positions that vary according to the selectable amount of manual force exerted by the user on the selection device. Such user force or energy exerted manually driven arc segment selection systems are preferred so that a user can immediately without delay change an arc segment during the course of performing a circuit of different exercises in rapid sequential succession using different machines or otherwise performing different exercises that exercise different muscle groups at different periods of time during the course of the entire circuit of sequential different exercises.

In alternative embodiments the selection device can be controllably driven by a motor or other electrically or electronically powered device rather than via exertion of a user s manual energy or force.

As shown in the resistance assembly can comprise a rotatably drivable R wheel having fan blades having surfaces that engage against ambient air when the wheel is driven R. The degree of resistance to rotation R of the finned wheel increases or varies exponentially or non linearly with the degree of speed of rotation R of the finned wheel . Typically the degree of resistance RES to rotation R of a fan or finned wheel increases or varies by a cube or cubed factor of or with the degree of speed of rotation R. Other resistance mechanisms other than a finned wheel such as an Eddy current controlled brake mechanism can be employed that increase decrease or vary in degree of resistance relative to the force F exerted by the user in a non linear geometric or exponential manner or relationship.

In the embodiment shown in the axis of the resistance wheel is connected directly to the axle of a crankshaft such that the wheel rotates R at the same speed of rotation as the crankshaft. Crank arms and are secured to each end of the crankshaft and are movably coupled to the drive linkages and respectively. As linkages are driven back and forth as a result of back and forth foot driven movement of pedals crank arms are rotatably R driven which in turn via their interconnection to shaft rotatably R drive shaft around its axis.

In alternative embodiments shown in intermediate drive pulleys or wheels and associated belts are typically employed whereby the hub of wheel is not directly connected to and does not rotate in unison with shaft but instead is rotatably driven at a higher rate XR than shaft which is driven at rotation rate R. As shown in the crankshaft is directly connected to the hub of intermediate drive pulley driving pulley at rate R. Drive pulley in turn drives a second intermediate drive pulley or wheel via belt at a higher rotational rate of YR by way of an intermediate hub that has a smaller radius than the radius of both of pulleys . Intermediate drive pulley in turn drives fan wheel via belt at an even higher rotational rate of XR by way of another intermediate hub to wheel that has a smaller radius than radius of both pulleys and . In a typical embodiment the ratio of XR to R is between about 10 1 and 20 1 most typically between about 13 1 and 15 1.

Rotation of the resistance wheel as described herein whether the wheel rotates in unison with the shaft or at a higher rotational rate creates a resistance to the force F exerted by the user such that the degree of force resistance RES created by the wheel varies exponentially or geometrically with the rate of rotation R or the amount of force exerted by the user on account the interaction of the surface of the fan blades that are mounted to the axle of the wheel with air. The faster that wheel rotates the amount of air resistance against surfaces of blades increases exponentially or geometrically. Similarly the rate of rotation generally varies non linearly exponentially or geometrically with the degree of speed velocity force work or power exerted by the user on the foot supports or resistance assembly et al. Typically the degree of resistance to rotation R of a fan wheel increases or varies by a cube or cubed factor of or with the degree of speed of rotation of the wheel.

Top bearings and receiving the axle or crankshaft are secured to a pivotable mounting bracket or arm such that as pivotable bracket or arm is pivoted forwardly and rearwardly shaft and its associated wheel is pivoted forwardly and backwardly together with bracket or arm .

As shown in in order to drive the foot pedals through any selected arc segment the user must exert a force F on foot pedals that has a horizontal or forward rearward component FH FH FH and a vertical or upward downward component FV FV FV. The degree of incline of the arc segment that the foot supports must travel through is determined by and will vary with the precise degree of the forward to rearward pivot position of bracket or arm As shown in the mounting bracket or arm pivots around the axis AA of bottom bearings and so as to be rotatable forwardly and rearwardly FB.

The motion path for the foot supports and can be selectively adjusted by adjusting the pivot position of mounting bracket or arm . As described above the mounting is pivotally mounted to the frame member and pivots fore and aft upon selective manual actuation of a mechanical adjustment mechanism. As is evident by reference to the Figures pivoting the mounting forward moves the components such as wheel secured directly or indirectly thereto forwardly. Likewise pivoting the mounting rearward causes the components secured directly or indirectly thereto to move rearward. This selective positioning FB of bracket or arm causes the arcuate segment or motion path of the foot supports and to move to a different location along an arcuate path around a point of rotation p shown between pivot assemblies and at a distance established by the length of the forward and rear linkages or legs and . Thus the specific location on the master arc or arc segment the motion path is user selectable to increase or decrease stride angle and location from a number of user selectable points or arc segments defined around the point of rotation.

In operation a user approaches the device from the rear region grasps the hand grips and and places a foot on each of the foot supports and . The user s feet and legs begin to move fore and aft in a comfortable stride. The user selects an exercise program or manually adjusts the device by imputing commands via the display control panel . Also in response to command input the mounting is moved fore or aft. As shown when the mounting moves forward the motion path of the foot supports is on a more inclined or vertical defined arc segment. To discontinue use of the device a user simply stops striding thereby causing the movement of the device to stop and dismounts from the foot supports.

As can be readily seen from the foot pedals always travel in the same overall or master arcuate or other configuration of path of travel from front to rear and from rear to front. The master arcuate path of travel J that the pedals may travel in remains the same regardless of what degree of pivot the bracket or arm is positioned in. Pivoting the support bracket or arm to different pivot positions only changes the arc segment e.g. segment AP or segment AP or segment AP through which the pedals may travel from rearwardmost to forwardmost positions but does not change the overall or master path of arcuate travel J. The master arcuate path of travel J is defined by the machine or apparatus itself i.e. by the mounting positioning lengths and widths of the links and . The user may select a segment of the overall machine defined arcuate path of foot pedal travel J depending on the degree of pivoting of bracket or arm that the user selects for any given exercise session. As described below each segment selected will have a different degree of incline e.g. H for segment AP and H for segment AP .

In an alternative embodiment as shown in mounting bracket or arm can be manually pivoted FB via extension or contraction of a mechanical arm that acts as a tilt actuator to pivot the mounting bracket or arm forwardly or backwardly as desired by the user. As can be readily imagined arm is manually actuatable by the user such as by the user s exerting a selectable degree of manual force by manually actuating a mechanical pumping or screwing mechanism that mechanically causes the arm to extend or contract to a desired degree that varies with the degree of mechanical force or energy exerted by the user and in turn mechanically pivots FB the bracket or arm to a desired degree. As shown the resistance mechanism pivots forwardly and backwardly FB about the pivot axis A of bracket or arm which is orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the frame . Both of the pedals and are synchronized together by the motion of crankshaft .

As also shown in the pedals travel along the same selected arcuate segment path AP or AP from front to rear and from rear to front one the pivot position of bracket or arm is selected.

As shown in as the foot pedal assemblies travel along the arcuate path AP from either front to back or from back to front the handles and arms follow the front to back movement of the pedals with a pivoting front to back or back to front movement. That is when the right pedal moves forwardly the right handle and arm pivot or move forwardly when the right pedal moves backwardly the right handle and arm pivot or move rearwardly when the left pedal moves forwardly the handle and arm pivot or move forwardly when the left pedal moves rearwardly the handle and arm pivot or move rearwardly. Such following motion is shown for example with reference to four bar linkage arm in three sequential front to back positions and which correspond respectively to arm positions . The degree of front to back pivoting of the arms can be predetermined at least by selective positioning of the pivot joints selective positioning of cross bar and selection of the lengths of linkage arms 

In the embodiments the user can reduce or transfer the amount of energy or power required by the user s legs and or feet to cause the foot pedals to travel along the arcuate path AP from back to front by pushing forwardly on the upper end of the arms during the back to front pedal movement. And the user can increase the speed of forward movement by such pushing or reduce the speed and increase the power or energy required by the legs to effect forward movement by pulling. Conversely the user can reduce or transfer the amount of power or energy required to cause the pedals to move from front to back by pulling backwardly on the upper end of the arms. And the user can increase the speed of rearward movement by such pulling or reduce the speed by pushing or reduce the speed and increase the power or energy required by the legs to effect rearward movement by pushing.

The four bar linkage foot assemblies and that are pivotably linked via the linkages to the pivotably mounted arms can be configured to enable the foot pedal and the plane in which the sole of the foot is mounted to either not rotate or to rotate pivot to any desired degree during front to back movement by selecting the lengths L and L and widths W and W appropriately to cause the desired degree of rotation pivoting. These four bar linkage assemblies also via the above described linkages to the arms cause the arms to travel along the same path of pivot from front to back and back to front.

In the embodiment shown in the linkages and are interconnected to the wheel via the four bar linkage and the linkages at opposing 180 degree circle positions and from the center of rotation of the crank arms and or shaft i.e. the linkages are connected at maximum forward and maximum rearward drive positions respectively. This 180 degree opposing interconnection causes the right and left and foot pedals to always travel in opposite back and forth translational directions i.e. when the right pedal is traveling forward the left pedal is traveling backwards and vice versa. Similarly the pivotably mounted arms and are interconnected to the bracket or arm and wheel via the four bar linkage the links and the links such that when the right arm is moving forward the left arm is moving backward and vice versa. As shown in the arms travel forwardly or backwardly together with their associated foot pedals and respectively.

In any event the left and right side pedals and input arms are linked to the resistance or drive assembly such that when the left side components i.e. left pedal and associated input arm are traveling forward the right side components i.e. right pedal associated input arm are traveling backward for at least the majority of the travel path and vice versa.

The upper body input arms are interconnected or interlinked to the same pivotable mounting member as described above via the links four bar linkage members and links as shown in . In the same manner as forward or backward pivoting of the mounting member changes the degree of incline and or path of travel of foot pedals as described above with reference to a forward or backward pivoting of the mounting member also changes the degree of back to front pivoting and or the degree of path of travel of arms . Thus in the same manner as the user is able to select the degree of incline of the path of travel of the foot pedals e.g. arc path segment AP versus arc path segment AP as shown in and also described above with regard to mount member enabling the user to select the degree of arc segment stride length and angle incline the user is able to select the degree of back to front front to back pivot stroke or travel path of input arms by adjusting the front to back pivot position FB of the center of rotation of rotation connection interconnection points and

The input arms are linked to the foot pedals in a manner that causes an input arm e.g. to move forwardly as its associated foot pedal moves forwardly and upwardly or conversely that causes an input arm to move backwardly as its associated foot pedal moves backwardly and downwardly along the user selected arc segment.

Although the wheel with fan blades is the preferred resistance assembly other resistance devices that create resistance that varies non linearly with the degree of speed velocity force F work or energy exerted by the user on the foot supports or resistance assembly are known to those skilled in the art and can be interconnected to the foot pedals 

Button labeled CIRCUIT INTERVAL permits the user to quickly and easily select the desired mode of operation accordingly he or she simply depresses the top portion to enter Circuit Training Mode and depresses the lower portion to enter Interval Training Mode. Up and down arrow keys and respectively allow the user to toggle between consecutive numerical values when setting inputs such as desired time or desired number of intervals. Button labeled GO ENTER functions as a confirmation tool allowing the user to begin the workout routine as well as approve input values or any other user system dialogues and interactions. Button labeled STOP REVIEW serves the opposite purpose allowing the user to terminate the workout routine and or enter review mode.

As shown in a user interface is comprised of an LCD visual display that displays the default interface for a Circuit Training Mode characterized by a menu label reading CIRCUIT TRAINING such that the user may easily ascertain the selected mode of operation at any given moment in time. All output values read 0 as the user has not yet begun the workout routine. In this interface the primary visual display area displays the user s instantaneous output power measured in units of Watts. The secondary visual display area displays more detailed information in the form of meters traveled SPM or Strides Per Minute and time elapsed .

After mounting the exercise device the user simply presses the Go button and begins the workout routine. Time counter begins tracking elapsed time updating every second. The SPM display measures the rate at which the user actuates the movable foot supports back and forth with periodic updates on the order of one second. The meters traveled visual display tracks cumulative distance over the course of the entire workout routine updating only when a new integer value of distance is achieved. Of course this figure refers not to a literal distance traveled by the user s body but rather the cumulative distance of the path s executed by the user s feet.

The user is not required to press the Go button to begin a workout routine providing an additional degree of flexibility and ease of use to the hurried or novice user. By simply actuating the movable foot supports into their back and forth motion the interface console is activated the only difference being that a more limited set of information is subsequently presented to the user. Primary display area will provide a reading of instantaneous power output in Watts exactly as described above and SPM will likewise function in an unchanged manner because these instantaneous values are not time dependent in their measurement. However display areas and meters and elapsed time respectively will have no output. They are accumulated time dependent values and as such cannot be accurately displayed in the absence of a discrete user defined starting point.

After completing the workout routine and pressing Stop button the interface of display is replaced with a review interface seen in . Label in the top left corner indicates at all times to the user that the mode of operation is and was set to Circuit Training Mode and furthermore that the interface console is in the review interface. This review interface is only accessible after those workouts which were initiated by pressing the Go button . For those cases in which the button was not pressed the display will return to the default interface depicted in after the user ceases operation of the exercise device.

The review interface is designed to be simple and easy to understand introducing no new measurements or other factors. It presents the user with just four values tabulated into either averaged or accumulated form. Display areas and average SPM and average Power respectively are averages that are measured over the complete duration of the workout routine and provide a convenient form for the user to characterize his or her overall physical performance or output. Display areas and are the accumulated values for meters traveled and time elapsed respectively.

Two changes distinguish . uses an inverted color scheme as compared to and the command prompt has updated to SET REST TIME in order to inform the user that he or she is choosing the amount of resting non exercise time that each interval should consist of. By utilizing an inverted color scheme it becomes far easier for the user to distinguish between the two discrete input steps as he or she would be more likely to fail to recognize the change if only command prompt updated between the two input steps. The amount of time that the rest period shall consist of is set in a manner identical to the one described above. The amount of work time and rest time need not be equal. Once the rest time is suitably adjusted the user presses Enter button and is taken to the final input interface screen seen in .

As between the color scheme inverts once again continuing the process of aiding the user in recognizing requests for new information or inputs. Command prompt has updated to SET TOTAL INTERVALS informing the user that he or she is choosing the number of intervals that the workout routine shall consist of. Note that one interval consists of a single work period followed immediately by a single rest period. As in the previous two input interfaces primary display area displays the adjustable currently selected input value. As before this value is incremented or decremented by arrow keys and . A smaller display area is introduced in this interface and provides the user with a convenient readout of how long the total workout routine will last based on the prior inputs of work time and rest time and the current input of total intervals. This readout is re calculated and adjusted concurrent with any adjustments that the user may make to the total number of intervals. After pressing Go button the user now begins the interval workout routine.

In Interval Training Mode display label has changed to read INTERVAL SETS 5 such that the user may easily ascertain that he or she is currently in Interval Training Mode and such that the user may furthermore keep track of the number of intervals or sets remaining. While the number five is seen in note that this is solely for purposes of example as in reality the number seen on the display updates in real time to indicate the number of intervals remaining in the workout routine. D

Immediately after the workout routine is initiated by the user the first interval begins starting with the work exercise portion. The user s current state or position in the cycle of the interval is indicated in the top left corner of primary display area by a label reading either WORK or REST . In both the work and rest steps a large counter fills primary display area beginning at the predetermined amount of time selected by the user via the process described above. The counter then decrements second by second until it expires at zero.

When the counter expires at zero the next step of work or rest commences and this cycle of intervals continues until the user presses Stop button or the input number of total intervals is completed in full. Once the workout routine is either terminated or expires on its own the user is presented with the review interface of . Label in the top left corner indicates at all times to the user that the mode of operation is and was set to Interval Training Mode and furthermore that the interface console is in the review interface. The review interface is designed to be simple and easy to understand introducing no new measurements or other factors. It presents the user with just four values all tabulated into accumulated form. Display area presents the user with the total number of full sets performed over the duration of the workout routine and similarly presents the user with the total distance in meters executed by his or her foot path s . Display area is shown depicting the average power output of the user in watts while display area presents the total amount of elapsed time spent performing the interval training routine.
