This invention is directed generally to the field of a beacon system for use in a building such as a commercial or a residential application. More specifically the application of on or more mobile Bluetooth transceivers enabled to support Location Based Service LBS applications.

Location Based Services LBS are rapidly expanding. Outdoor location technologies are mainly based on Global Positioning System GPS technologies. The Global Positioning System GPS cannot perform properly indoors and is therefore inadequate. As a result indoor location systems are appearing on the market.

The need for a system arises from various market segments and applications. One example in the market is the Global Positioning System GPS based systems that use integrated positioning and navigation systems based on Global Positioning System GPS receivers as the primary positioning technology. Subsequent to the events of September 11th the Federal government mandated that Global Positioning System GPS capability be built in to all cellular phones. However the fact that uninterrupted satellite reception is not possible in many locations is a major limitation of Global Positioning System GPS based systems. Densely populated areas and radio frequency signal shadowed locations such as urban centers alternatively referred to as urban canyons generally do not allow proper operation of Global Positioning System GPS yet it is in these locations that the need is greatest.

There is a clear need for a cost effective system that maintains performance indoors in urban canyons and in city centers.

Another important consideration is that the Global Positioning System GPS is susceptible to jamming and other man made interference.

The Global Positioning System GPS is a satellite based navigation and time identification system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. The Global Positioning System GPS originally served marine airborne and terrestrial users in the military and has been later adapted to serve civilians as well. Specifically Global Positioning System GPS includes the Standard Positioning Service SPS that provides civilian users with 100 meter accuracy as to the location or position of the user. For military users Global Positioning System GPS provides the Precise Positioning Service that is accurate to within 20 meters. Both of these services are available worldwide with no requirement for any local equipment.

A first limitation of the Global Positioning System GPS is that upon activation the Global Positioning System GPS receiver scans for signals from the constellation of Global Positioning System GPS satellites. A unit must locate and receive signals from at least four 4 satellites in order to be able to determine its location. This process of locating the minimum number of satellites receiving the data and achieving a position fix can take several minutes. This delay is problematic for many Global Positioning System GPS applications.

A second limitation of the Global Positioning System GPS is that the receiver needs a clear view of the sky to successfully receive signals from the constellation of associated satellites. Again under unfriendly signal receiving conditions such as inside buildings in urban canyons in the shadows of high buildings and the like the Global Positioning System GPS suffers from multi path effects and therefore shows poor performance or worse none at all.

A third limitation of the Global Positioning System GPS is limited accuracy. The civilian version of the Global Positioning System GPS signal includes limited accuracy by design. While knowing a position of an individual to within an accuracy of 50 to 200 feet anywhere on the planet is a major technological feat. This accuracy may not be sufficient to provide a location and or navigation to a user in a store a mall to a vacant or available parking space each space measures about 10 feet and the like. The use of the Global Positioning System GPS is further limited in an indoor environment such as most indoor stores and or malls as the Global Positioning System GPS cannot work effectively when the receiver is located in doors or a line of sight to the satellites is blocked by a roof or other object.

Existing navigation systems such as the new mandatory Global Positioning System GPS equipped cellular telephones are based on the Global Positioning System GPS and have the aforementioned limitations.

Another significant factor adding to the limitations of the Global Positioning System GPS based systems is the important role of map production. In an optimal scenario a user would want a map to be as detailed and as up to date as possible. The existing maps used by the Global Positioning System GPS based applications provide limited detail and are not able to reflect changes on a real time basis. More importantly mapping for indoor facilities is essentially not readily available to the general public or integrated into Global Positioning System GPS based applications. The recent introduction of imagery services such as GOOGLE EARTH and its competitors are offered as an enhancement to Global Positioning System GPS . Even with these they are still present outdated information. The consequences of limited and outdated mapping are unsatisfactory results wherein users encounter road changes and area development changes that not shown on the maps and imagery.

In general the subject invention is based on applying machine learning techniques to the task of inferring aspects of the user s status from a stream of input from small RF tags or beacons which are installed in a local area including indoor and or outdoor locations or in places designated as Point Of Interest POI . Examples of areas of deployment of the RF tags or beacons can include a mall a department store adjacent to a product inside a store within a street parking or garage parking area and the like. In a broad sense the RF tags or beacons can be located indoors outdoors in a public location in a commercial location and the like. The RF tags or beacons can employ Radio Frequency IDentification RFID long range type technology Bluetooth with the option to long range Bluetooth technology Wi Fi technology or any other suitable RF technology. The RF tags or beacons are adapted to broadcast a unique identification ID using any suitable wireless broadcasting technology that includes an identification portion in a unidirectional pulsing signal. The identification portion in a unidirectional pulsing signal identifies a location of the RF tag or beacon by including a unique identification ID such as the address or location and type of facility store product and the like. The RF tag or beacon broadcasts location identification and any other desired information in the identification portion in a unidirectional pulsing signal to be picked up by a compatible receiver integrated into the mobile telephone. An association application would decode the received identification portion in a unidirectional pulsing signal and act accordingly.

The application is adapted for indoor guide navigation and Location Based Services LBS or navigation in crowded urban areas where Global Positioning System GPS based systems due to lack of access to satellites or the Global Positioning System GPS limitations detailed previously cannot achieve the required results.

The disclosed applications focus on the task of interactively guiding the user to a desired indoor destination.

The user may wish to locate a vacant or available parking space in his her vicinity wherein the parking spaces can be located outdoors or within a covered parking area such as a parking garage.

The user may wish to locate a specific store within a shopping mall a particular aisle in a department store or even as detailed as a specific item on a shelf.

The user may wish to locate a specific conference room in a convention center a Point Of Interest POI in an amusement park a Point Of Interest POI in a museum and the like.

The user may be looking for a train location in a train station train stops associated with a subway or train stops associated with any other underground train system.

At present however no prior art device utilizes the capabilities to display a real time representation of navigating directly from the sensors without a central system and without using a Global Positioning System GPS based system directly to the user. Most systems are designed for an antiquated query type search where interface to an Internet and or a database to a central system is needed.

The navigation system automatically detects a beacon signal transmitted directly from the RF beacon. The process does not require any bi directional communication such as cellular communication to determine the location of the mobile device. Contrarily other systems require bi directional communication and must have bandwidth available over which to send a request to a central system or to a database and then must wait for a response. This requires an operational bi directional communication infrastructure and additionally takes time.

Even if the other systems have bandwidth available the other systems are still based on the existing search concept where the user submits a query searches and waits for the response. This is impractical. The subject system provides the information automatically without submitting any query and the response is according to the user s location wherein the user s location is determined by proximity to the beacon in the local area.

Again most of the existing prior arts are based either on a Global Positioning System GPS based system or an integrated in car navigation system employing the Global Positioning System GPS . The existing mapping employed by these systems includes the same limitations described previously and is impractical.

The present invention bridges the gap between the Global Positioning System GPS based navigation by providing an improved and complete solution.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 031 875 issued to Ellenby et al. describes a pointing system for addressing objects provide a system and method based on Global Positioning System GPS and Internet and or database communication. Ellenby 875 is not exactly a navigation system but an information based system that requires the Global Positioning System GPS to locate the user location. Therefore any indoor services are likely out of the question and the requirement for communication with the Global Positioning System GPS limits its availability and accuracy.

The system as provided by the present invention determines the location using the beacon signal emitted by the RF tag or beacon the identification portion of the beacon signal emitted by the RF tag or beacon Proximity Detection PD and Received Signal Strength RSSI Time of Arrival TOA and Angle of Arrival AOA .

This method relies upon a dense grid of antennas each having a well known position. When a mobile device is detected by a single antenna it is considered to be co located with the single antenna. When more than one antenna detects the mobile the closest antenna is the one that receives the strongest signal and is therefore determined to the antenna that is co located with the mobile device.

This method is relatively simple to implement. It can be implemented over different types of physical media. In particular Infra Red IR and Radio Frequency IDentification RFID are based on this method.

In case more than one RF tag or beacon signal is detected the process can use triangulation taking Proximity Detection PD a step further. The location of the mobile device is determined by measuring the signal level measurements from each antenna then applying a triangulation algorithm to optimize the location.

Time of arrival TOA is based on triggering the mobile devices to respond and measuring the time it takes for the response to complete a transmission back to the antenna. The elapsed time represents the distance between the two. By using distances from a few antennas a position of the mobile device can be triangulated. Time of arrival TOA is considered to be the most accurate method because multi path effects can be filtered out. Yet Time of arrival TOA is considerably more complex to implement as it requires a modification to the hardware on the mobile device side as well as special modifications on the antenna or beacon side.

Angle of Arrival AOA is based on finding the direction of maximal signal intensity for each antenna beacon mobile device pairing. By finding an intersection of several direction vectors a position of the mobile device can be estimated using the Angle of Arrival AOA . The use of the Angle of Arrival AOA technique is considerably less accurate than using Time of arrival TOA technique due to limited angular resolution and the fact that in an indoor environment much of the signal can be reflected. Also Angle of Arrival AOA antennas are more complex as they require multi section highly directional antennas and multiple RF circuitries.

Bluetooth is a newer wireless local networking standard that operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the range is normally shorter typically 10 15 m although there are tags with a range of over 300 feet . On the other hand Bluetooth is a lighter standard highly ubiquitous integrated into most cellular telephones PDAs Personal Computer PC peripherals etc. and supports in addition to Internet Protocol IP several other networking services. Notably Bluetooth supports serial port emulation voice and various types of object exchanges. Bluetooth RF tag or beacons are small pocketsize transceivers.

Every Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon has a unique identification ID . This identification ID can be used for locating the RF tag or beacon and providing location information of the mobile device in the proximity.

The relevant location scenario of the present invention is that of searching for a certain RF tag or beacon. It is the most accurate and the faster response time and it is this method in indoor navigation and locating when and where each RF tag or beacon identification ID is a known address position waypoint.

Bluetooth uses a Radio Frequency RF in a 2.4 GHz ISM band. In this frequency range radio waves penetrate obstacles such as walls and human bodies albeit with a substantial loss.

The availability of a hi there application as the Bluetooth receiving device would receive some signal from the RF tags or beacons.

RF tags or beacons can be placed relatively far apart typical range is 10 15 meters . This enables a deployment where RF tags or beacons are not necessarily required to include one RF tag or beacon at each way point .

Bluetooth is ubiquitous Bluetooth chipsets are being integrated everywhere nowadays cellular telephones portable electronic accessories computing devices and the like . The RF tags or beacons can be implemented anywhere inside buildings along roadways inside cars or other transportation entities inside buildings for triggering automation or in any kind of business triggering application and or automatically creating a link to an existing system.

The fact that a Bluetooth location system can locate any Bluetooth enabled device makes it more cost effective solution. This means that an increasing fraction of humans and mobile assets around would become locatable in a Bluetooth covered site with no additional hardware cost no RF tags or beacons attached . The only requirement is to pre register these devices.

Bluetooth devices are considered to operate using a low power technology where battery powered Bluetooth enabled tags or beacons need to be recharged approximately once a week or longer depending upon the usage scenario . Non tags for example Bluetooth enabled cellular telephones are naturally recharged on a regular basis so they do not need any special recharging. If the Bluetooth enable portable devices non tags are being used to determine a location of the device the fraction of power consumption added to their usual non Bluetooth operation power consumption is relatively small.

Bluetooth devices are considered to be a low cost technology having expected high production volumes hundreds of millions annually lead to sub five dollar 5 cost per chip. It is noted that several Integrated Circuit IC manufacturers have already met this goal at the time of this disclosure. This would eventually result in a low price for the Bluetooth tags or beacons if and when Bluetooth location systems would become sufficiently ubiquitous. Bluetooth protocol is a multi functional communication standard where location determination is only one of many services that can be supported by a Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon infrastructure. The same RF tag or beacon infrastructure can be used to provide additional network services particularly remote monitoring and control or just trigger a link to an existing system. In addition Bluetooth provides voice and Internet Protocol IP services although for the later WLAN is typically more suitable .

In open spaces relatively free of obstructions and walls for example a large warehouse a public hotspot and the like Bluetooth technology would suffice to provide a 2 meter error range.

The proposed RF tag or beacon technology offers unique advantages one is the ability to locate ubiquitous any tags . Any Bluetooth enabled device including newer mobile telephones can be associated with and use the advantage of the Bluetooth beacons. The other advantage is the multiservice nature of the Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons infrastructure that enables using the Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons for other purposes such as determining a location of the Bluetooth enabled device navigation remote monitoring and control triggering an existence triggering a link to existing systems triggering or initiating software and for a variety of Location Based Services LBS and local push messaging services.

In accordance with the present invention these are the characteristics associated with locating and navigation.

The proposed system provides a method for locating and providing navigation based on the following unique characteristics 

In an indoor or outdoor navigation situation the RF tags or beacons would replace the function of the satellites in a Global Positioning System GPS based system wherein the RF tags or beacons in conjunction with the respective software provide the user with the information and directions needed to reach a desired destination.

The detection and navigator the software adapted to provide a method used to display the data and the information from the area triggered as result of being in a close proximity to at least one RF tag or beacon in the area.

Small RF tags or beacons are installed in each place designated as a Point Of Interest POI . The Point Of Interest POI can be at a mall in department store near a product inside a store along a street within a garage parking in an indoor environment in an outdoor environment in a public area in a commercial area and the like. The RF tags or beacons can be of configured to employ any suitable protocol including Radio Frequency IDentification RFID long range type Bluetooth technology with the option to use long range Bluetooth Wi Fi technology or any other suitable RF transmission protocols. The RF tags or beacons broadcast a unique identification ID using the wireless transmissions. The unique identification ID identifies the location of the RF tag or beacon such as the address of the RF tag or beacon the type of facility the store the product and the like. The RF tag or beacon broadcasts the information which is adapted to be picked up by the mobile telephone and utilized by the navigator application via the cellular or mobile telephone or other Bluetooth enabled device operating in accordance with the application the beacon identification ID trigger application and push information to the Bluetooth device or the Bluetooth enabled cellular or mobile telephone.

The system can serve as an add on to the mall s and or store s current guide or mapping processes to provide extra assistance to user.

The user s mobile device would scan the local area for the identification ID broadcasted by the RF tags or beacons in the vicinity by way of the Bluetooth system integrated into the cellular telephone. It is important to note that the disclosed solution does not require cellular communication an Internet access or a database access to determine the location of the mobile device and that any Bluetooth enabled device can operate the navigation application as a stand alone device. The beacon system can interface with existing in car system and or car navigation system.

The display method is a unique way to bridge existing devices like cellular telephones in car systems in car navigation and other Bluetooth devices. The system provides an overlay display method which places an overlay over an existing navigation system mapping a floor map floor images and the like as a real time floating display or as a waypoint to overcome the limitations of Global Positioning System GPS based systems and the existing mapping systems. The indicator would be placed as an overlay onto the floor plan image. The display may further include providing a visual indication a circle overlaid onto the floor plan image of the path wherein the visual indication the circle indicates an area of the indoor map where the location information identifies a particular location and the circle provides the accuracy radius circle.

Mapping A system and method for mapping an indoor environment is provided. A user s mobile device may receive an indication of a starting point on a floor plan.

The application on the user s mobile device may prompt the user to travel in a particular direction or the direction of travel may be determined by the application on the user s mobile device in response to the user indicating a second location after the user has traveled to the second location.

As the user travels from the starting point in the designated direction the application on the user s mobile device may gather information about the indoor environment. For example the user s mobile device may gather wireless signal strength data from RF beacons Wi Fi or Bluetooth in the proximity of the mobile device while the user travels in the designated direction.

The application on the user s mobile device may associate the gathered information with the path the user traveled from the starting point to the ending point. The operation can be done at the user s mobile device the cellular handheld device . The association may also be performed by a remote server using data provided by the application on the user s mobile device. As the user travels from point to point the client device may indicate the area for which valid location information is available based on the path the user traveled and the information the user collected.

Mapping can be offered as an additional service for the indoor environment based upon an area a building floor plan or image mapping.

The navigation system will enable remote planning based on downloaded local floor plans the floor mapping or floor images. The indoor view images of the local building facility or local navigation when the location s floor plan can be triggered to downloaded at the destination. An example of this would be at the entrance of a shopping mall a department store an amusement park a museum a parking garage a downtown area of a city and the like.

The navigation system is based on a network of RF tags or beacons that can be deployed anywhere. The system is accurate to within 10 feet significantly better than existing navigation systems and Global Positioning System GPS . The system can work inside a building whereas Global Positioning System GPS cannot.

The system provides information about each facility and or store including information about the type of facility the type of store a product and the like.

By providing the ability to locate the user in an area using any suitable Bluetooth enabled device such as a Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone with the navigation application and the RF tag and or beacon method the system overcomes the anxiety of Where am I . The system can also be adapted to facility finding a parked car later via the RTP Return to Parking feature.

The system has the capability to perform all the functions of a search function and can become the Next generation search out of the box .

The navigation system can be attractive for places that already deploy Wi Fi and can be used for the existing Wi Fi devices as a RF tags or beacons.

The system eases and facilitates navigation within indoor locations without requirement of a navigation map or Global Positioning System GPS . Indoor mapping can be provided as part of the navigation system. The system provides local navigation as well as remote detection.

The system saves gas time money and eases global warming by reducing the time spent searching for destination.

The navigation method is unique. The navigation system is based upon RF tags or beacons with interface to Bluetooth enabled devices. This feature allows detection and navigation in locations where Global Positioning System GPS cannot work as well as outside with the ability to guide the user to within 10 feet of the destination significantly better than any other navigation and Global Positioning System GPS based systems on the market.

The Bluetooth RF tags or beacons are based on a long range version of the popular short distance communication. This unique feature affords the user the ability to plan ahead from a remote location by obtaining identification ID about the destination directly from the RF tags or beacons and by accessing the indoor floor plan to be navigated at the destination.

A major problem with In Car navigation and Global Positioning System GPS mapping is that they cannot guide the user closer than 50 to 200 feet and only in open places. The navigation system can provide accurate directions to within 10 feet.

The navigation system will be a challenge to navigation providers and Global Positioning System GPS providers as they cannot provide mapping or navigation inside a mall department store a parking garage or lot and anywhere the Global Positioning System GPS Navigation map cannot accurately help navigate.

Utilizing this innovation the facilities in the vicinity around the user car are displayed on a floating overlay using either a cellular telephone application or a stand alone device or an existing installed navigation system with or without any mapping.

The recent introduction of imagery services such as Google Earth and its competitors that are offered as an enhancement to Global Positioning System GPS at a fee still provide out of date information with the unsatisfactory result that users encounter road changes and area development not shown on the maps and imagery.

Navigation using the mapping or floor plan of a location can be offered as a part of the system. The option of downloading a floor plan can be exercised either remotely or locally.

Each RF tag or beacon broadcasts a beacon signal continuously and any of the navigation devices will detect the beacon signal and display the identification ID and or data on the user s mobile device in an easy to understand format.

Using the applications described herein the user enjoys having the information that they want when they want it where they want it and at an affordable price.

Once the user is in the vicinity of their destination and the user switches on their navigation device by being in proximity to installed RF tags or beacons in the area the user s mobile device will automatically receive facility information along a waking route and in all directions around the user.

No further action is required more specifically there is no need to send a request or to access the Internet or the web or to log on and search a database or central system. Any access to the Internet is to provide a Location Based Service LBS like push information messages offers deals advertising and the like to the mobile user.

Other systems are still based on the existing search concept where the user submits a query the provided server searches and the user waits for a response. The process is impractical particularly in a condition where the user needs the information immediately. The navigation system provides the information automatically without submitting any query and the response takes into account the user s location determined by the proximity to the RF tags or beacons.

The unique approach to detection of the mobile device within the building does not require any Internet bandwidth or cellular communication to complete a desired procedure. Communication links using the Internet or the cellular network can provide Location Based Services LBS and any additional information that can be pushed to the user s device.

As a result the proposed processes don t require any delays or waiting for bi directional communication and access time. The information is provided to the user instantaneous triggered directly between the RF tags or beacons identification ID and the user s mobile device.

Additionally each facility type can be coded to include an identifier ID to identify the type of facility such as a store such as a restaurant a men s wear store a women s wear store and the like.

Each facility identification ID code can trigger or initiate access to information about the respective facility such as providing automatic waypoint information.

The disclosed applications such as the navigator can operate on a cellular or mobile telephone without any need for a cellular connection to determine the current location. The disclosed applications also do not need any information from the Global Positioning System GPS .

Moreover the navigation system can solve a Return to Parking RTP problem where the Return to Parking application can aid a user in a scenario where the user forget where he she parked his her car. The Return to Parking feature has an option to save the location on a cellular telephone parking detector application that will make it easy to locate the user s parked car.

The navigation solution is designed for global use and is not limited to malls stores amusement parks museums sports stadiums and the like. It can be implemented in parking garages metered parking spaces or open non metered parking spaces. The RF tags or beacons can be installed anywhere including in locations adapted to trigger or initiate an existing and location based application adapted to link the mobile device to an existing system and existing software.

It is envisioned that in the future all new construction will have the RF tags or beacons included in the design even place addresses a building addresses can be replaced or used as an add on with the implementation of a RF tags or beacons in the area to be recognized or scanned by any suitable and enabled mobile device.

The system integrates the navigation as part of an application referred to as NAV4 where the system will provide complete solutions for local navigation in an area where the Global Positioning System GPS might not work.

An infrastructure of RF tags or beacons wherein each RF tag or beacon is installed in a known location within a localized area.

The navigation system or application is based on mapping and navigation to and within the location. The aim of the navigation system is to replace or supplement the guide or map of the mall and or store guide map. This is accomplished by installing the RF tags or beacons in each store or adjacent to each Point Of Interest POI .

The mapping As the Global Positioning System GPS and the associated Global Positioning System GPS mapping are not available for indoor applications. The navigation system is based upon a floor plan mapping or floor images that can be made available from each facility or other suitable source. For planning ahead the floor plan or the floor images can be downloaded by the navigation application operating on the user s cellular telephone from a remote source by way of the Internet prior to arriving at the desired destination. Alternatively the information can be automatically provided or triggered when the mobile device arrives at the desired destination.

The navigation application is adapted to be operable on the most commonly used device in the world today any cellular telephone having a Bluetooth interface.

As a difference from other systems and other local based systems this solution offers a unique approach that can be described as the search out of the box as the application does not require a query or a database search the application only needs to know the identification ID of the RF tag or beacon that is located proximate the Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone. The Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone automatically scans and recognizes any local area Bluetooth based RF tags or beacons and determines the user s location using the received and decoded beacon signal and provides instant information to the user and to the business or businesses in the area.

A typical application is to guide and or navigate a pedestrian within an environment such as a mall a department store a specialty store a conference a trade show an amusement park a university a hospital a school a municipal building a museum a subway a train station an airport a down town center a finance facility a cruise ship any type of parking facility or any other place where Global Positioning System GPS is insufficient provides less than required accuracy or is inoperable in the environment of the user. For example the system will be used for navigation by first responders in an emergency or a disaster scenario.

The navigation system can be part of a broad suite of applications that includes a complete solution for employment by the user from the time that he she begins looking for a space to park his her car the time he she parks the time that he she begins walking to the store mall or any other indoor facility to the time that he she wants to return to his her parked car by providing directions to the location of the parking space where his her car is parked.

Nav4 mall and or Nav4store which is a navigation solution for use within an interior of a mall a store and the like.

Return to Parking RTP which is a navigation solution to guide the user to the location of the parking space where his her car is parked.

In an emergency condition the first response team can utilize the system to obtain navigation about an interior of a smoke filled building.

A store owner can use the notification and the knowledge of existence of a user by way of an identifier associated with the user that is provided by the user s mobile device for loyalty and rewards programs.

The RF tag or beacon identification ID can trigger a link to exiting software and aware the local system of the user existence such as 

A system and method to provide a user information which is related to any Points Of Interest POI . The navigation system provides detection and navigation referencing position determination and information related to the object or Point Of Interest POI . This can be accomplished directly and automatically to the user s application enabled cellular telephone or mobile device upon approaching or within a close proximity to the RF tags or beacons installed in the area.

Special operation mode Shopping Shopping provides navigation to a special a sale item and the like within a department store.

Special operating mode Museums Museums provides navigation about the museum s exhibits and interactive information from each of the museum s exhibition to the user s cellular telephone or mobile device by way of a Bluetooth interface.

Special operating mode Parking Parking features are described within two 2 Patents U.S. Pat. No. 7 899 583 and U.S. Pat. No. 8 941 485 both issued to the Inventor and claimed to be parent applications hereto . Parking provides detection and notification of vacant or available parking spaces within a parking area and navigation to the vacant or available parking spaces as well as navigation or guidance to return to a parked car.

Special operating mode Nav store provides navigation inside a store or department store. The navigation feature can guide the user to a specific department a specific aisle or a specific product. The navigation feature can optionally include advertising methods and notifications of special promotions. The navigation feature can also provide the business owner with ability to know in a way of automatic notification when the user s cellular telephone or mobile device is within a proximity to the local area. When the user s cellular telephone or mobile device is within a proximity to the local area the system can be adapted to automatically deliver information related to the store or business. The delivered information can be but is not limited to deals coupons specials and even statistically information about the user s habits.

Every Bluetooth device s RF tag or beacon has a unique identification ID . This identification ID is adapted to be used for locating the RF tag or beacon and providing location information of any mobile device in the proximity thereof.

A relevant location scenario is that of searching for a certain RF tag or beacon. The relevant location scenario is the most accurate and the faster response time and is one solution for indoor navigation and locating when and where each RF tag or beacon identification ID is a known address position such as a waypoint.

Bluetooth technology uses a Radio Frequency RF that is in a 2.4 GHz ISM band. In this frequency range radio waves penetrate obstacles such as walls and human bodies albeit with a substantial loss.

The RF tags or beacons can be placed relatively far apart from one another. The typical range of the RF tag or beacon is 10 15 meters. Therefore it is not necessary to deploy one RF tag or beacon within or proximate to each way point.

Bluetooth technology is ubiquitous. Bluetooth chipsets are being integrated everywhere nowadays mobile telephones accessories computing devices and the like . The RF tags or beacons can be implemented anywhere such as within buildings along roadways inside cars in use with transportation entities inside a home for home automation triggering in any kind of business and the like. The system can be used to trigger an application and or link the device to an existing system.

The fact that a Bluetooth location system can locate any Bluetooth enabled device makes it more cost effective solution. This means that an increasing fraction of humans and mobile assets around would become locatable in a Bluetooth covered site with no additional hardware cost no RF tags or beacons attached . The only need is to pre register these devices. Bluetooth is a low power technology which can be deployed as tags which need recharging of approximately once a week or longer depending upon the usage . Non tags e.g. BT enabled telephones are being recharged anyway on a regular basis so they do not need any special recharging. If the mobile devices are being used for location and or navigation the fraction added to their usual non Bluetooth enabled operating mode power consumption is relatively small.

Bluetooth is a low cost technology anticipating high production volumes hundreds of millions annually leading to sub 5 per chip. Several Integrated Circuit IC manufacturers have already met this goal. This would eventually result in a low price for the Bluetooth tags or beacons if and when Bluetooth location systems would become sufficiently ubiquitous. Bluetooth is a multi functional communication standard whereby a location application is only one of many Location Based Services LBS that can be supported by a Bluetooth infrastructure. The same infrastructure can be used to provide additional network services particularly remote monitoring and control or just trigger a link to an existing system. In addition Bluetooth technology provides voice and IP services although for the later WLAN is typically more suitable .

In open spaces relatively free of obstructions and walls e.g. a large warehouse or a public hotspot Bluetooth alone would suffice to provide a two 2 meter error range.

A waypoint is a fixed location with a known address location preferably using longitude and latitude coordinates. The navigation system is capable of storing a database of waypoints for the following purpose 

Waypoints mark a destination a point along the way to a destination or a point of reference. Normally in navigating a route consists of one or more waypoints. To traverse a route the user navigates to the nearest waypoint then to the next one in turn until the destination is reached. The system has the ability to compute a great circle route towards a waypoint enabling them to find the shortest route even over long distances. The system enables users to locate a destination on a map an indoor floor plan or an indoor image and define the center of the circle as the waypoint. The system is intended for navigation. The system can generate a suggested route between two waypoints based on the cartographic database. The system indicates the user s current location and gives advance notice of an upcoming point.

Because the system knows the waypoint positions and the distance between them it is easy to determine the user s exact location assumed to be the same location as the location of the mobile device .

The navigation solution is further enhanced although it is not essential when the system knows that the person or object being located is traveling along known routes on a map. For example the system can assume that people might only follow certain routes in a mall. This is priority information that can be used to force the estimated position to be on the nearest point on the possible routes. It is noted that this is easier to predict in an indoor environment compared to an outdoor environment.

The constraints of indoor construction similarly can be used to refine estimates of the position of a person or object moving within a building as people and objects do not pass through walls they travel along corridors and through doorways. It is a best solution for a system in case of an emergency for a system for homeland security or a system to locate and inform in a subway environment. One good example is a hotel exit floor map.

In the indoor application instead of using the Global Positioning System GPS the system uses beacon signals from RF tags and beacons having known waypoint positions that are detected and identified as a demonstration of the concept of using another sensing method. The beacon signal s received from one or more RF tags or beacons are used to detect and identify the location of the receiving device and determine the waypoints located proximate thereto. Theoretically it would be possible to convert the waypoint positions into Global Positioning System GPS coordinates and emulate an external Global Positioning System GPS data source.

This system can be useful for providing navigation to first responder personnel where indoors waypoints have been installed in a particular building in the form of RF tags or beacons wherein the identifiers of each RF tag or beacon is associated with the known location of the RF tag or beacon. By using the identifier it may be possible to associate magnetic anomaly information with individual tags as well.

One of the important features of the indoor navigation techniques is that the technique will enhance the ability of a tactical team s first response team to navigate within the building in which the navigation system has been deployed. Bluetooth enabled RF tag or bacon tracking devices are commonly attached to persons or to moveable objects so that the objects can be tracked using fixed readers special purpose radios deployed at different locations. This is the most common indoor navigation that exists today.

The navigation method is the flip side of this practice and is based on the concept that the detection of a Bluetooth enabled RF device or RF tags or beacons in a known fixed location by a moving reader such as a Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone or other Bluetooth enabled device provides a precise location of a person or a moving object by the carrier of the cellular telephone or mobile device who can supply indoor navigation without Global Positioning System GPS .

The navigation method provides a low cost reliable system for firefighters and other first responders enabling navigation within an interior of buildings where a Global Positioning System GPS is not reliable. Under certain conditions the Global Positioning System GPS satellite signals may have been temporarily disabled to prevent exploitation by terrorists. In a more likely condition the satellite signal can t be received inside the building or other structure.

The disclosed navigation system foresees this limitation of Global Positioning System GPS based systems and is intended for an environment that is potentially much less friendly to Radio Frequency RF signals. More specifically the environment inside a building that first responders encounter may contain smoke dust or flames and is intended to leverage advances in Bluetooth or other RF enabled tag or beacon technology. The navigation system will exploit the capability of storing critical building information such as floor maps and emergency escape plans available for retrieval and navigational assistance using any Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone or other mobile device when and where it is needed.

Moreover the navigation system can serve as a navigator for the emergency exit route when and where needed. Each user can load the emergency exit floor plan and escape with the knowledge of the user s exact location along that route.

The system identifies and tracks the user a first response team member and can further include an option to use the cellular telephone as a beacon.

The system provides the user with navigation information and directions for safely exiting the building.

The system provides location information of all team members by way of an ad hoc network of radio terminals that combine RF and Bluetooth and allow communication chat and messaging between the team members without a need for any Internet or cellular communication. Such an option is not limited to the first response team but can be adapted for any user in an emergency and a non emergency condition.

From the outset the navigation system was designed with the capability to utilize existing technology so the system can be deployed as a standalone system or in tandem by a link with one or more existing systems. The navigation system focuses on employing technology that is already in place that simply needs to be expanded.

With the implementation of the navigation system a first response team will be empowered to navigate and find its way in an emergency or a disaster condition. This capability can be a critical life saving power in modern congested urban living conditions a capability that was not available prior to this invention.

It is believed that the implementation of the navigation system will assist counter terrorism activities and more importantly will help the first response teams to save lives of people trapped inside buildings.

The applications of Bluetooth technology described herein offers a number of unique advantages The application provides an ability to scan and determine a location using a small RF tag or beacon installed in an local area which emits a signal including the RF tags or beacons identification ID . The Bluetooth technology provides a low cost and low battery consuming device. The applications of Bluetooth technology can be activated on any Bluetooth enabled device.

The other advantage is the multiservice nature of the Bluetooth infrastructure that adaptation of the RF tags or beacons for other purposes such as for navigating remote monitoring and control a triggering mechanism to activate applications and or systems automatically establish a link to one or more existing systems provide a variety of messaging capabilities provide a push for conveyance of information enable Location Based Services LBS and the like.

Location Based Services LBS are rapidly expanding. Outdoor location technologies are mainly based on Global Positioning System GPS technologies. Global Positioning System GPS are limited or inoperable indoors and is therefore provide an inadequate solution. As a result alternative indoor location systems are appearing on the market.

The need for a system arises from various market segments and applications. One example in the market is the Global Positioning System GPS based systems that use integrated positioning and navigation systems based on Global Positioning System GPS receivers as the primary positioning technology. Subsequent to the events of September 11 the Federal government mandated that Global Positioning System GPS capability be integrated into all cellular telephones.

However the fact that uninterrupted satellite reception is not possible in many locations is a major limitation of Global Positioning System GPS based systems. Densely populated areas and other radio frequency signal shadowed locations such as urban centers alternatively referred to as urban canyons generally do not allow proper operation of Global Positioning System GPS yet it is in these locations where the need is greatest.

There is a clear need for a cost effective system that maintains performance indoors in urban canyons and in city centers.

The disclosed application includes finding a solution to this task by providing a system and method to automatically generate waypoints along the user s route either in an indoor environment or an outdoor environment.

The disclosed application addresses the task of interactively guiding the user to a desired indoor destination and or a desired outdoor destination.

The method for mapping an indoor environment is provided. A user s mobile device may receive an indication of a starting point on a floor plan. The application operating on the user s mobile device may prompt the user to travel in a particular direction or the direction of travel may be determined by the user s mobile device in response to the user indicating a second location after the user has traveled to the second location.

As the user travels from the starting point in the designated direction the user s mobile device may gather information about the indoor environment. For example the user s mobile device may gather wireless signal strength data from Wi Fi or Bluetooth enabled RF beacons located in the proximity of the user s mobile device while the user travels in the designated direction.

The user s mobile device may associate the gathered information with the path the user traveled from the starting point to the ending point. The operation can be done at the user s mobile device such as a cellular handheld device. The association may also be performed by a remote server using data provided by the user s mobile device.

As the user travels from point to point the user s device may indicate the area for which valid location information is available based on the path the user traveled and the information the user collected.

The method may include displaying a floor plan image a floor mapping or a floor indoor view. The floor images correspond to an indoor location receiving a first input to indicate a first location on the floor plan image gathering initial location information at the first location and generating an indoor map using a processor using the initial location information wherein the indoor map includes an association of the initial location information with the first location.

The method may further include repeating the location information gathering process at a new location to associate new location information with the new location in the indoor map.

The method may include gathering additional location information as the user travels from the first location to a second location receiving a second input to indicate the second location on the floor plan image determining a path from the first location to the second location and associating the additional location information with at least one location within the map corresponding to the path.

The method may include prompting the user to walk in a straight line when traveling from the first location to the second location.

The method may include providing instructions to the user to travel in a particular direction. The location information may be included in wireless signal data associated with one or more wireless RF tags or beacons installed in the local area. The first input may include performing a selection operation with an indicator placed on the floor plan image.

The method may also include providing a visual indication on the floor plan image of the path. The visual indication may indicate an area of the indoor map where the location information identifies a particular location. The building floor plan may be received from a remote server by way of the Internet or a cellular communication as part of the mapping and navigation application.

The method may also include a step of determining an approximate location determine by proximity to the RF beacons providing the approximate location to the remote server receiving a list of floor plans associated with indoor environments proximate to the approximate location and selecting the building floor plan from the list. The method may include identifying the user s direction of travel by at least one of a determining a relative orientation using the first location and the second location or b using at least one of a user s mobile device built in sensors accelerometer a gyroscope or a compass.

The method may include a step of determining a degree of precision of the location for the data gathering operation and using the degree of precision of the location to determine a location resolution for the indoor map. The degree of precision of the location may be determined using a number of available RF tags for beacons for which signal strength data and the beacons identification ID are available. The degree of precision of the location may determine at least one of the sizes of an indicator for indicating the current location the size of the accuracy radius circle or the width of a stripe for indicating an area of the indoor map for which the location information has been gathered. The application will display an appropriate overly on the floor map the image map the building map or any other applicable display map image. The method may include determining a coverage level of the indoor map compared to the floor plan images.

The navigation system and method automatically updates waypoints when each Point Of Interest POI will have an RF tag or beacon that will broadcast an RF identification ID signal that will provide an instant detection. The navigation system will execute the specified file or program that will automatically trigger execution of a waypoint generation program.

For some years local governments in cooperation with various FM radio stations and recently a navigation system have been putting together an automated way to get real time traffic data into cars so drivers can avoid traffic related issues. Real time traffic information includes news such as congestion construction traffic accidents recommended alternative routes and the like. Currently available navigation systems depend on fix sensors or cameras and some navigation on manual information provided by the users or drivers.

An RF tag or beacon will be installed at each desired known location or at each Point Of Interest POI . Each RF tag or beacon will broadcast an RF signal containing an identification ID to be received and recognized by the mobile device and such information including the RF beacon ID will automatically transfer by way of the user s mobile device to the provided location detection of the user as well as statistical information about any possible traffic in the area. Such a method can be extremely helpful to manage and control a transportation system.

The user will no longer need to enter his her way points manually and then wait for the provider of maps or Global Positioning System GPS to update their maps with the information. The process of updating the maps can take about a year in some cases. This way the user will receive the information that the user needs when the user needs it and where the user needs it upon entering an area with RF tags or beacons providing an automatic check in for the user and the facility business.

Again no communication is needed to be established between the RF tags or beacon and the user s mobile device to enable detection of the RF tags beacons. In the event that more information is desired or required it may be necessary to connect to a website or other server by way of the Internet.

It is believed that sooner or later it will be a standard procedure to install an RF tag or sensor on every location of interest waypoint or any place along any road in an indoor environment in an outdoor environment or within any business. The RF tag or sensor will provide waypoint information to each user. Most waypoints such as stores or other Points of Interest POI will be willing to pay for a RF tag or beacon or pay a subscription fee to be included on the map on the local area. This can include payment for an annual listing similar to the telephone directory .

The system can interface with existing Global Positioning System GPS outdoor mapping as well as indoor mapping. The system can automatically switch between an outdoor application which is adapted to employ an outdoor map and receive information based on Global Positioning System GPS and an indoor application which is adapted to receive an indoor map and indoor navigation employing the RF tags or beacons.

Presently Global Positioning System GPS providers map providers and search engines provide City navigators and metro guide maps that contain many thousands of attractions.

These include Food and Lodging Attractions Entertainment Shopping Services Transportation Emergency and Government offices. In most areas the maps provided are not updated and sometimes provide misleading information. Some of the waypoints listed appear to be very old and the information associated with them is not update. Listed Attractions include theme parks museums libraries schools parks and such. This feature is very useful when a user is located within an unfamiliar area.

Waypoints will be located automatically in the local area and plotted on the map displayed upon the screen of the mobile device. The waypoints can be stored on the local map at the handheld telephone or mobile device for future access.

The navigation system will revolutionize Global Positioning System GPS based systems and the mapping industry from Global Positioning System GPS mapping companies communication providers car manufacturers to telephone directories and local guides. For the first time the user of a Global Positioning System GPS navigation system will have an easy reliable way to reach a destination inside buildings facilities which can be referred to as the indoor world.

The most common problem with today s Global Positioning System GPS based systems is that navigation and mapping is not existent in an indoor environment. The disclosed navigation system provides the solution for this problem. Using the navigation system the user will know where the user is be able to accurately identify landmarks around the user and receive automatic updates directly from the Points Of Interest POI in the vicinity that get automatic notifications about the user s presence in the respective area.

The navigation system is based on RF tags or beacons each RF tag or beacon is associated with a waypoint and has its own identification ID identifying the waypoint by type address etc. . The RF tag or beacon will broadcast using Radio Frequency RF the identification ID to be scanned and picked up by the Bluetooth enabled mobile device. The identification ID provides a detection method and triggers a location identifier presented as a floating information image on the indoor map wherein the location identifier references the user s location. The floating image or display will provide automatic waypoint updates around the local area and will allow the user to search local providers such as waypoints stores and the like without any connections communication access to the Internet or cellular communication. The signals received from the RF tags or beacons are the only information required to determine the location of the mobile device as well as an accuracy radius circle. Access to the Internet or any other web communication provides more information such as push notification and messaging and Location Based Services LBS such as deals direct advertising and the like all of which can be automatically conveyed to the user s mobile device.

Once the user is in the vicinity of their destination a notification is automatically sent to the Internet a website or a business. The user will automatically receive the facility information along an associated waking route and in all directions around you.

No further action is required. There is no need to send a request or to access and search a database or a central system.

Conversely other systems must send a request to a central system or to a database and then the user must wait for a response. This takes time and a communication link.

The disclosed unique approach provides results without any delay or waiting for communication or authentication and access time as there is no real communication between the RF tags or beacons and the user s mobile device. The result are instantaneous based upon the association directly between the RF tags or beacons and the user s mobile device or other navigation device

The RF tags or beacons broadcast their identification ID to be scanned and pickup by the user s mobile device to identify the location of the user using a proximity to the RF tags or beacons.

Additionally the identification ID identifies the type of facility the store and the like. For example the Identification ID can state whether the facility is a restaurant a men s wear store a women s wear store and the like. The Identification ID can include the location of the user respective to the store such as in the front of the store in the back of the store and the like.

Each facility can provide information about the store. For example the automatic waypoint information of the user s presence can trigger or initiate an automatically notification to the business or other waypoint in the local area.

Due to the limitations of the mapping system currently used by the Global Positioning System GPS navigation system the associated display method provides a unique solution to bridge existing devices like cellular telephones in car navigation and other Bluetooth devices. The disclosed navigation system provides an associated overlay navigation display method as a real time floating display or as a waypoint to overcome the limitations of current Global Positioning System GPS based systems and the existing mapping systems especially indoors where each waypoint will be displayed over indoor maps or floor map images.

The display method is one unique way to bridge existing devices like cellular telephones as a real time floating overlay on a directional circular display to overcome the limitations of Global Positioning System GPS based systems and the existing mapping systems.

The overlay add up device display works like a VOR and provides add up display which automatically shows the user their location in the immediate area in a circle which includes a radius representing an accuracy and proximity distance from the locally detected RF tag or beacon.

The overlay displays over an existing navigation system portable device or cellular telephone without Global Positioning System GPS support providing a circle that shown the location accuracy of the user on the local map.

The fact is no digital maps are entirely accurate. A user needs to know which map makers are used by the product that they are interested in and check the maps for the area that they are concerned about. In addition some map databases are created from vector data while others are just scanned copies of paper maps. In addition to mapping data these same map makers can often provide Points Of Interest POI data. However a software company might use the maps from one company and the Points Of Interest POI data from another company. Points Of Interest POI data normally takes three forms. One is public buildings parks airports and possibly geographic objects. A second is government locations that include specialized points lists like marker buoys and airplane markers. Finally there are commercial establishments that usually include some information about their products and contact information. The location of commercial places is often derived from the street address and is not based on the actual latitude and longitude location information. Moreover there is the sky high cost of digitizing and updating the Points Of Interest POI and the waypoints.

The task is to provide a solution when the user will receive real time Point Of Interest POI or waypoints in the area where the user is automatically associated with a located proximity to RF tags or beacons in the area. The waypoint information can be information that is provided in real time or essentially updates in real time and can be changed according to the waypoints and all according to a proximity detection of the RF tags or beacons identification ID in the area. The information can be used in these example applications 

The user may wish to locate an empty available parking space in the vicinity of the user. Just think of the empty parking spaces as waypoints. The system will determine if each parking space is vacant or occupied using the RF tag or beacon and associated sensor. The RF beacon will broadcast identification ID only when the parking space is available. The user s Bluetooth enabled mobile device will scan the area for the broadcasted signals from the beacons to find the available parking such method describe in more details with U.S. Pat. No. 7 899 583 issued to the Applicant claimed as a copending parent application and incorporated herein by reference .

The user may wish to see and locate real estate property available in the area proximate the user s location. An RF tag or beacon can be installed in each real estate property to trigger a request for more information. The additional information would be forwarded to the user or possible client when the user reaches a proximity to the property.

The user may wish to locate a specific store in a shopping mall. Waypoints can be as broad as a store in a mall a particular aisle in a department store or as narrow as a specific item on a shelf.

The user may wish to locate a specific conference room in a convention center a Point Of Interest POI in an amusement park or a Point Of Interest POI in a museum.

The user may wish to find the emergency exit route during an emergency or the first response team may need navigation within a facility in an emergency situation.

The user may be looking for a train location at a station or a stop along a route of a subway or other underground train system. All of this information would be updated including the waypoints in real time.

It is believed that the automatic updates of waypoints revolutionizes the Global Positioning System GPS and Navigation Industry.

For the first time the user will know the information the user wants and receive the information when the user wants or needs the information all according to the location of the user.

The local business owner can automatically introduce associated content in real time to the users in the area of the business when the user accesses or enters the respective store. The content can include deals coupons and specials and provide more information to user about the business. The business in turn can benefit from statistical information about the clients such as habits a client profile loyalty and rewards.

The Global Positioning System GPS and navigation industry can tap to the huge local advertising market which is estimated to be 134 Billion in the US alone.

Return To Parking RTP can assist the user in returning to the location where the user parked their car.

A store owner can use the notification and the knowledge of existence of the user for loyalty and rewards.

The identification ID of the RF tag or beacon can trigger a link to existing software and notify the local system of the presence of the user such as 

A traveler is checking in into a hotel or resort. The hotel or resort can provide with automatic check in and interface to the hotel or resort guest receiving system.

A traveler is checking in to a flight in the airport. The airline provides the traveler with an automatic check in for the flight when the traveler reaches a close proximity to a localized RF tag or beacon.

A customer is checking in to a restaurant or food service. The business will recognize the customer when the customer is in the proximity of the local RF tag or beacon.

The pedestrian reaches an advertising area or billboard that can be recognized by the user located a close proximity to the advertising area and provides the user with customized and or personalize advertising or offers.

A customer is entering a store a bank or any other a facility wherein the user is recognized accordingly and the facility provides additional information or services.

The RF tags or beacons can serve to track an employee s work times including a check in and checkout times from a designate area.

The RF tags or beacons can serve as part of a payment process where the user s cellular telephone and the local proximity RF tags or beacons can provide additional security for a payment process.

The local RF tags or beacons associated with the user mobile can create a virtual security zone for a child an elderly person or any care monitoring.

The location of the user can be associated with the local beacons which can be interfaced with social networking.

The RF beacons can be integrated into a solution for parking related issues where each parking location can be identified by an RF beacon. The solution would include additional sensor to determine the occupancy status of the parking space referred to by the Inventor as nav4parking . This process can determine whether a parking space is occupied or vacant and provide this and other parking information to the end user. The RF beacon will broadcast a parking space identification only when the parking space is available. The user s Bluetooth device will scan the area for the signal from the broadcasting beacons to aid in locating the available or unoccupied parking space s . This method is described in more details in U.S. Pat. No. 7 899 583 issued to the Inventor and claimed as priority herein.

The RF tag or beacon can be installed into or integrated within a vehicle to provide vehicle related applications such as payments security car broadcasting car tracking car communication and automatic car counting. The proposed system can automatically provide transportation management with statistically information.

A system and method to provide a user with information which is related to the Point Of Interest POI the navigation system provides detection and navigation references position determination and information related to the object or Point Of Interest POI directly and automatically to the user interface such as the mobile device upon arriving to a close proximity to the RF tags or beacons installed in the area.

At present no prior art utilizes the capabilities to display a real time representation of navigating and get an update directly from the waypoints. Also most systems are designed for the old query type search where interface to Internet and or database central system is needed.

The navigation system automatically detects a signal directly transmitted from the RF tags or beacons installed at the waypoints. No communication is required to be established between the mobile device and the RF tag or beacon including cellular communication and no pairing is required. Other systems must have bandwidth available wherein the bandwidth is used to send a request to a central system or to another remote database and then the system must wait for a response. Alternatively other systems require Internet connections. This takes time.

Even if other currently available systems have bandwidth those systems are still based on the existing search concept where the user submits a query searches and waits for the response. This can be impractical. The navigation system provides the information automatically without submitting any query and the response is according to the user s location based on RF tags or beacons installed in the local area.

Again most of the existing prior art is based either upon a Global Positioning System GPS based system or an existing car navigation system which coincidentally also depends on a Global Positioning System GPS .

The existing mapping used by these systems has the same limitations as described previously and is impractical.

The disclosed navigation system bridges the gap between the Global Positioning System GPS based navigation systems and provides a complete solution.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 031 875 to Ellenby et al. describes a pointing system for addressing objects and provides a system and method based on Global Positioning System GPS and Internet or database communication. The system taught by Ellenby et al. is not exactly navigation but an information based system that requires the Global Positioning System GPS to locate the user s location. Because of the reliance upon the Global Positioning System GPS indoor services is likely out of the questions and the need for bi directional communication as well with Global Positioning System GPS limits its availability and accuracy. The system taught by Ellenby et al. does not provide real time updates of the waypoints and needs access to the Internet and or a central database.

One common problem with today s Global Positioning System GPS based systems is that the mapping and the waypoints are not updated on a timely basis. In most areas the maps provided are not updated and sometimes provide misleading information. Some of the waypoints listed appear to be about two 2 years old. The new service like GOOGLE EARTH provides satellite images that are almost two 2 years old and for sure can t provide an on line and real time accurate picture of the existing area and the associated waypoints.

The disclosed technology offers a solution to this task by providing a system and method to automatically generate waypoints along the user s route either in an indoor environment or an outdoor environment. The updates are based on the determined location of the mobile device in proximity to installed RF tags or beacons and the updated information can be triggered by the determined location. Such a method does not exist in today s navigation or mapping especially in an indoor environment.

The disclosed technology offers a solution that interactively guides the user to a desired destination independent of the location being indoors or outdoors.

The disclosed navigation system and method automatically updates waypoints by using an interface to an existing Global Positioning System GPS based system when each Point Of Interest POI will have an RF tag or sensor that will broadcast an RF signal that can be converted to a Global Positioning System GPS waypoint In response to the RF signal from the RF tags or sensors the navigation system will execute the specified file or program that will automatically trigger a waypoint generation program.

For some years local governments in cooperation with various FM radio stations have been putting together an automated method to provide real time traffic data to vehicles so drivers can avoid traffic. Real time traffic information includes traffic conditions such as congestion construction traffic accidents and recommended alternative routes.

A Bluetooth and or Wi Fi enabled RF tag or beacon will be installed at each Point Of Interest POI . Each Point Of Interest POI will have an RF tag or beacon that will broadcast a wireless RF signal with identification ID that will provide an instant detection. The navigation software or other application for Location Based Services system will execute the specified file or program that will automatically trigger waypoint generation program and at the same time provide the business owner a notification of existence of the user in the vicinity of the business to allow the business to provide the user with relevant messages or offers more information or push message to the user cellular telephone just by being in proximity to the RF tag or beacon.

The user will no longer need to enter his waypoints manually and then wait for the providers of maps or Global Positioning System GPS to update their maps with the information this can take about a year in some cases . This way the user will receive the information that the user needs when the user needs it and where the user needs it.

It provides a process that automatically triggers delivery of information according to the RF tag or beacon located in the proximity of the user. The information would be provided directly from the local area business waypoints and to the user s display device. The detection of the user can be accomplished without any bi directional communication. In the event that more information is required and or the business needs to provide more information it may be necessary to connect to the Internet. The connection to the Internet allows an interaction or engagement based upon a proximity to the Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon. This can trigger specific application functionality and provide automatic notification of I am here to the business owner.

It is believed that sooner or later it will be commonplace to install a RF tag or beacon on every location of interest waypoint or within any business will provide waypoint information as a method to provide each user with the information. Most stores Point Of Interest POI or other waypoints will be willing to pay for a RF tag or beacon or pay a subscription fee to be on the Global Positioning System GPS system providers that are able to show their location and information on a map. Alternatively the merchants would pay for an annual listing similar to the telephone directory .

Present Global Positioning System GPS providers map providers and search engine providers such as City Navigator and Metro Guide Maps contain thousands of attractions.

Other waypoints that can be included food and drink locations lodging attractions entertainment shopping service providers transportation emergency facilities and government offices.

In most areas the maps provided are not updated and sometimes provide misleading information. Some of the waypoints listed appear to be about two 2 years old. Listed attractions can include theme parks museums libraries schools parks and the like. This feature is very useful when a user is located in an unfamiliar area. Waypoints will be automatically included in the local area and plotted on the map screen. The waypoints can be stored in the Global Positioning System GPS database for future access or stored on the user s mobile device.

The navigation system will revolutionize Global Positioning System GPS based systems and the mapping industry from Global Positioning System GPS communication providers for the mapping companies car manufacturers to telephone directories and local guides for the first time the user of a Global Positioning System GPS navigation system will have an easy reliable way to reach a destination.

One common problem with today s Global Positioning System GPS based systems is that the mapping and the waypoints are not updated on a timely basis. The disclosed navigation system provides a solution for this problem. Using the disclosed navigation system the user will know where the user is be able to identify landmarks around the user accurately and receive automatic updates directly from the Points Of Interest POI located in the vicinity of the user.

The navigation system is based on RF tags or beacons installed in the local area. Each tag or waypoint has its own identification ID identifying the waypoint by type address etc. . The RF tag or beacon identification ID and proximity to the RF tags or beacons will allow localized detection and interface with existing or indoor application and navigation Global Positioning System GPS based systems as a floating information display on the Global Positioning System GPS map referenced to the user s location. The floating display will provide automatic updates of waypoints and will allow the user to search local providers waypoints and or stores and more information about the store or business. The localized detection allows the local businesses to have an automatic notification when the user approaches or is within the proximity to the business and allow him to provide the user with more information about the store the business any deals and the like.

The task is to provide a solution where the user will receive real time Point Of Interest POI or waypoints in the area automatically to the user s existing navigation system or to the user s cellular telephone. The waypoint information can be a real time information update in real time and can be changed according to the waypoints.

A cellular telephone application which the user will scan the area for exiting Bluetooth or Wi Fi enabled RF tags or beacons will receive data and more information utilizing the cellular telephone s Bluetooth capability.

The system can trigger an application as well as a link to any existing system and software. A notification can be sent to a web email a web based application or even interact with a social network. The navigation system will interface with existing in car media system and in car navigation systems.

It is understood that the waypoint or Point of Interest POI will be represented by the following suggested identification ID examples as part of the beacon identification ID to be recognized by the user Bluetooth mobile device cellular telephone according to the type of the Point Of Interest POI 

The identification ID described above is only are suggested examples. The fact is that part of the beacon identification ID will be to recognize the facility the store type or the location to provide instant detection and determine the user s location by just being in a close proximity to the RF tag or beacon in the localized area.

The navigation system enables remote and local update of the local floor plans and the information about the local area and waypoints business in the area when the location s indoor application can be triggered to download at the destination. One example of this would be at the entrance of a shopping mall a department store an amusement park a museum a parking garage or a downtown area of a city where a sign or a shopping mall information sign would provide direct information which would trigger a download of the local application.

The system can work inside a building whereas the Global Positioning System GPS cannot. Local detection is obtained by way of the Bluetooth interface.

The disclosed system provides information about each facility or store including information about the type of the facility. For example the type of store a product and the like. The identification ID of the RF tag or beacon triggers delivery of information based upon the proximity of the user s mobile device to the RF tag or beacon.

The navigation system can be an attractive addition to existing deployments of Wi Fi and Wi Fi hotspots and a feature for business and cities that deploy Wi Fi.

Utilizing the navigation system the facilities waypoints in the vicinity around the user car are displayed on a floating overlay using either a cellular telephone application a standalone device or an existing installed navigation system with or without any mapping . The information can be pushed to the user s mobile device when the user is in the proximity of the area.

The recent introduction of imagery services such as GOOGLE EARTH or other similar services that are offered as an enhancement to Global Positioning System GPS at a fee still provide out of date information with the unsatisfactory result. For example users can encounter road changes and area development not shown on the maps and imagery.

The option of downloading a floor plan can be exercised either remotely or locally as part of mapping or navigation application.

With the navigation system the user will have the information that the user wants when the user wants it where the user is located and at an affordable price. Once the user is in the vicinity of their destination and the user switches on their navigation device the user will automatically receive facility information along the walking route and in all directions around them.

Additionally each facility type can be identification ID coded apart of the beacon identification ID to identify the type of the store and the like For example the type of waypoint can be a restaurant a men s wear store a women s wear store real estate property a garage sale location a special sale. The information is provided as being up to date real time information information which can t be displayed and located using today s navigation system. The disclosed system can tap into the local business industry providing localized advertising.

Each identification ID code can be included as part of the beacon identification ID which can trigger a process to access and obtain complete information about the store.

The system can be operate on a cellular telephone or any other navigation system and would not be limited to a Global Positioning System GPS navigation system.

Moreover the navigation system can solve the Return to Parking RTP problem where many users might forget where they parked their car. The system has an option to save the location on the cellular telephone which would employ a parking detector application. The parking detector application provides directions to the user to the location of their parked car which will make it easy to locate their parked car.

The navigation system is designed for global use and is not limited to malls stores amusement parks museums sports stadiums etc. It can be implemented in parking garages metered or non metered parking spaces almost anywhere and in any place even in any infrastructure.

It is envisioned that in the future all new construction or infrastructure will have the RF tags or beacons included in the design or built in the structure.

One feature of the proposed invention integrates the navigation as part of the NAV4 concepts where the system will provide complete solutions for local navigation in an area where the Global Positioning System GPS and Global Positioning System GPS mapping just can t provide accurate and updated information that is so essential to the user.

A typical application is navigating a pedestrian in an environment like a mall a department store a specialty store a conference a trade show an amusement park a university a hospital a school a municipal building a museum a subway a train station an airport a down town center any type of parking facility or any place when and where the Global Positioning System GPS cannot be provided or is not accurate or precise enough. The system can be used for navigation by first responders during an emergency or a disaster.

The navigation system is part of a broad suite of applications that include a complete solution to the user including when the user begins looking for a space to park the user s car when the user parks their car when the user walks towards a store or a mall and or when the user wants to return to his parked car looking for the place that the user s car is parked in.

It is understood that the present invention can provide a new tool and service which would benefit of the amusement parks and the user alike.

Special operating mode roadway support referred to as NAVSIGN The roadway support function can provide the user with automatically generated waypoints associated with road signs wherein the waypoints would be displayed on the user s navigation device the user s cellular telephone and or the car navigation system as a way for secure driving. The information can communicate with the car computer to provide automated support. For example the system can automatically slow down the car when the car enters a school zone.

Special operating mode emergency referred to as NAV EMERGENCY One of the important features of the disclosed indoor navigation applications is to provide enhanced navigation to the first response team within the buildings in which the team has been deployed.

The navigation system provides a low cost reliable solution for firefighters and other first responders to navigate inside buildings where the Global Positioning System GPS is not reliable as the Global Positioning System GPS signal can t be received within the interior of the building or the Global Positioning System GPS satellite network may have been disabled temporarily to prevent exploitation by terrorists.

The disclosed navigation system anticipated these limitations of the Global Positioning System GPS based systems and is intended for an environment that is potentially much less friendly such as the environment first responders encounter inside a building may contain smoke dust and or flames and is intended to leverage advances in ubiquitous Bluetooth or other RF tag or beacon technology.

The navigation system will exploit the capability of storing critical building information such as the floor maps and emergency escape plans for retrieval and navigational assistance by way of a Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone when and where the information is needed. Moreover the navigation system can serve as a navigator describing the emergency exit route when and where it is needed. Each user can download the emergency exit floor plan and escape from the building with the knowledge of the user s exact location along the emergency exit route.

Provides location information of all team members using an ad hoc network of radio terminals that combine RF and Bluetooth technology and allows communication chat and messaging between team members without any need for Internet access or cellular communications. This application is not limit to the first response team and can be employed by any user in an emergency and a non emergency condition.

From the outset the navigation system was been designed with the capability to utilize existing technology so the navigation system can be deployed as a stand alone system or in tandem with existing systems.

With the implementation of the navigation system a first response team can be empowered to navigate and find its way in a case of emergency or a disaster. This capability can be a critical life saving power in modern congested urban living conditions that was not available before now.

It is believed that implementation of the navigation system will assist counter terrorism activities and more importantly can help first response teams to save lives of people trapped inside buildings.

Provides direct communication between the area waypoints and the user the beacon navigation application and or the Global Positioning System GPS 

Use in an indoor environment and or an outdoor environment excluding a requirement for use of the Global Positioning System GPS 

A business model where the business store or store owner can subscribe to a service for including a listing in the navigation Global Positioning System GPS mapping application.

Exclusive of any requirement for Internet access or cellular communication in order to detect and determine a user s location for use in conjunction with additional Location Based Services LBS information.

Capability to interface with the existing system and create and support a link to an existing software and hardware system.

The option of searching is completed locally on the user s mobile device without a requirement of a central database or an Internet search.

Any Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone is capable of running the Navigation or other Location Based Services LBS application.

Provides indoor navigation using an indoor facility map and or floor images for guidance and navigation.

All Global Positioning System GPS navigation systems lack of real time displays of the waypoints around the driver s or user s route. Therefore it is inherently probable that the information provided by the Global Positioning System GPS maps are old or outdated and are therefore inaccurate.

The navigation system provides a system and method for automatically generating and updating navigation waypoints along a route in real time. The process can be based upon a proximity of the user based upon the detection of localized RF tags or beacons installed in the area. The recognition of the user within an area can automatically trigger delivery of real time waypoint information along the user s route. The information would be transmitted directly to the user s navigation device and or cellular telephone.

The navigation system can present a circular omni directional display on the map or floor images as a floating overlay shown on an existing navigation map floor map or indoor floor images.

The waypoint data trigger is generated directly from the waypoint beacon s identification ID . Again the process can be accomplished without the need for Internet access or cellular communication to determine the location of the user s navigation device.

The navigation system will bridge the existing navigation system and Global Positioning System GPS mapping to new real time information according to the user s location.

The navigation system will allow for the first time the navigation and Global Positioning System GPS industry to tap into the local advertising market estimated to be 134 Billion in the US alone. The proposed mapping processes are at the forefront of local strategy. Due to the lack of availability of the Global Positioning System GPS in an indoor environment the limitation of the accuracy of the Global Positioning System GPS in an outdoor environment and the non updated mapping that is currently provided by the mapping and Global Positioning System GPS industry there is no real tapping to this huge market.

It is believed that the navigation system can bring a new life to the navigation and mapping industry as well to the cellular providers by providing a unique innovation that combine the Global Positioning System GPS and the existing navigation to the real time information directly from the waypoints which can be referred to as a COOLSPOT.

The disclosed invention is directed generally to the field of navigation and more particularly to a method for providing navigation to a user wherein the navigation is adapted for use in an indoor environment or an outdoor environment. Examples of locations include within a mall a store a building a department store. Additionally the disclosed invention provides Location Based Services directly to the user s navigation device or cellular telephone.

The proposed applications have identified and resolved a great deficiency in the technology available for local businesses. Location Based Services LBS represent a huge advertising and mapping market estimated at over 150 billion a year. Location Based Services LBS represent a big opportunity in the navigation market that has not been explored yet.

Local mapping today is mostly paper. Mall maps store maps mapping of department stores commercial buildings hospitals schools campuses municipalities shopping centers downtown districts indoor facilities building maps parking areas parking garages amusements parks subway systems transit maps museum maps area attractions maps hotel and resort maps and even more importantly the emergency maps and procedures posted in buildings.

A high degree of accuracy is needed in order to provide usable maps for navigation indoors. The desired accuracy would be less than 10 meters. This accuracy is to adequately support navigation to a store a parking space and the like.

The Global Positioning System GPS cannot provide acceptable accurate mapping as it is only accurate to within 100 to 200 feet. This is the reason why the Global Positioning System GPS industry does not provide this type of mapping. The same is true for cellular network providers as the accuracy is also within 100 to 300 feet and that is only when the cellular network is available or accessible. Cellular network signal availability is often a problem in an indoor environment and also problematic when it is most needed during an emergency condition. In most emergency conditions the cellular networks fail due to power outages communication issues and high bandwidth demands. Again this is the reason that there is no local mapping available for cellular users. Local mapping equates to accuracy in finding a store a room or a parking level within 5 m. 

At this time there is no indoor navigation solution. The most recent technology provides access to a user s location through a combination of group social networking and a buddy list.

Most technology available today attempts to locate a moving user within an area. The present invention reverses that idea and lets the user navigate the local area on local maps using indoor navigation compared to outdoor navigation. Pedestrian navigation is more than locating and navigating. Most likely the user is at or near their destination already. There are two possibilities either the user is unfamiliar with the surroundings and their task will be to explore the surroundings or the user is looking for a specific product. The user s defined goal can be as simple as buying a new pair of shoes getting a book or just going to shop around exploring a new location new deals specials sales or simply sightseeing.

The theory is based on the belief that you are what you do meaning services specials sales coupons discounts and the like are one key element.

One main task of indoor navigation is to show the user where specials sales and coupons are and directly navigate the user to them. At the same time the indoor navigation program provides the business owner or operator with a marketing tool that currently is non existent. The integration of multimodal journey planning and guidance to dynamic waypoints sales specials and complex public interchange facilities and the like are not adequately addressed by existing systems.

In some aspects indoor navigation looks simpler than outdoor navigation. For instance the geographical area covered is much smaller and the expected speed of travel is much lower as the user would be walking. However other aspects make indoor navigation much more challenging. Initially among these is the unsuitability of Global Positioning System GPS and related technologies within an indoor environment. Additionally in a complex indoor environment the requirements are more stringent. For example vertical positioning of the topology and the need for accuracy less than 10 meters to the store the product to the aisle containing a desired product or the parking space cannot be achieved with today s existing systems.

Navigation within the indoor market represents much greater potential than the outdoor market as on average people spend more than 90 of the time indoors.

The Objectives and Goals behind This Concept The technology behind the navigation system is quite simple. The technology employs a direct communication between the user s mobile device cellular telephone or a Bluetooth enabled device in conjunction with Bluetooth enabled tags sensors or beacons installed in a known locations within an area a building a store or a facility without relying on the Global Positioning System GPS centralized servers Internet access or bandwidth or cellular communication. It is noted that although these functions are not required they can be supportive when available.

The main concept is to use existing off the shelf technology such as Bluetooth technology or Wi Fi technology with small modifications and devices with a minimal cost of deployment and to provide a simple indoor technology which can deliver accuracy with an integrated suite of applications. The concept is especially designed for the user or shopper in an indoor environment. The system is based upon RF tags or beacons such as Bluetooth or Wi Fi enabled RF tags or beacons installed in the local area. The RF tags or beacons would be scan by the user s mobile device or cellular telephone and use the proximity of the scanned beacon identification ID and signal strength to provide an instant detection of a user within the area and would automatically notify the business owner of the presence of the user. The system can also trigger delivery of updated location based information to the user all without exchanging any paired communication with the RF tags or beacons in the vicinity of the user.

Local mapping or local floor images The indoor view of the facility is a feature of the application. The facility can offer a download from participating merchants. The download would provide a local map from a proximity information sign a store information center a mall information center a building information center or a respective server. The downloading can be triggered by the application according to the user s location as determined by the proximity to the RF tag or beacon or preloaded as part of navigation feature or mapping application before the user reaches the area.

An ability to include special navigation software either as an add on to existing navigation on the user s cellular telephone or the existing navigation system car mobile device using the Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons to determine the exact location and trigger applications.

An ability to deploy Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons in the local area where each RF tag or beacon will broadcast the identification ID wherein the identification ID includes the known location waypoint and triggers additional information and or Location Based Applications LBS . The Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons provide the infrastructure needed to guide or navigate each user in the area. This solution provides a very low cost and fast deployment RF tag or beacon system.

The ability to use a log of the user s Bluetooth identification ID or the Bluetooth identification ID as a key not the cellular telephone number associated with the user for future marketing purposes or for emergency use. This aggregation of data in conjunction with an association to a proximity of a Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon identification ID will be invaluable to retailers businesses and the like. Bluetooth enabled cellular telephones can be also be used as Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons.

The RF tags or beacons portion of the navigation system are Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons installed in known locations within the area or facility. The Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons represent waypoints where the beacon identification ID can identify a facility type a store a special sale a place a location in the facility location and the like.

The scanner detection part of the application employs a Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone or mobile device. When the Bluetooth feature and the application are active the application will periodically scan the area for any Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon that is located in the proximity. The scanner obtains the beacon signal and determines the identification ID of the RF tags or beacons as well with signal strength. The application will use the identification ID of the RF tags or beacons as well with signal strength to determine the location of the user. The location of the user would be displayed on the area map or facility map and will automatically trigger a notification an automatic check in to the business owner or operator and or establish a link to an existing system to provide the user and the business owner additional information. All of this would automatically be accomplished when the user is located in the proximity of the Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon.

In regards to the sale sense or other marketing tools the system works by passively observing the initial part of the scanning of movement. The proposed system does not monitor or listen to conversations or text messages. Nor do the proposed applications transmit or intercept any information or interfere with the mobile network operators in any way. The navigation system is a scanning detector not a receiver or transmitter which can observe the unique Bluetooth identification ID or key set of the mobile device. This is not a telephone number or name of the device. The unique Bluetooth identification ID or key set of the mobile device in association to the identification ID of the Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon in a proximity of can provide aggregate resultant data to a server to collect and maintain information for habits and or preferences for triggering content delivery.

Sales sense represents a method to use dynamic user input profiling with proximity beacon identification ID installed in the known location in an indoor environment and or an outdoor environment for empowered presence and triggering content delivery for a real life interaction. All of the functions would be under the user s complete control without compromising the user s privacy. The paradigm of proximity based discovery and communication enabled by Bluetooth technology can be very relevant in ambient intelligence as an enabler for a situated interaction.

The navigation system explores the use of predefined user input user profile or preferences as a key driver for situated interaction and triggering of content delivery according to the user profile or preferences. The approach is to use of Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons installed in known locations within a local area to trigger action which associate the identification ID and or profile preferences provided by the user s cellular telephone or mobile device beyond self exposure and introduces a method that can trigger actions.

The approach to the use of Bluetooth identification ID of the Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons beyond self exposure introduces a technique in which the system can recognize the Bluetooth identification ID as explicit instructions to trigger actions and or processes.

Initially because the disclosed system has an extremely low entry barrier as Bluetooth devices are based upon a widely available technology. More importantly all newer cellular telephones or other mobile devices include Bluetooth technology and setting Bluetooth identification ID of a Bluetooth enabled device is normally a relatively simple task that can be accomplished with the base functionality of any mobile telephone. The easy availability is of huge importance in enabling social practices around the technology and represents a major difference to other sensing and interaction approaches that albeit more sophisticated may require specific hardware or software in personal devices. Secondly the use of Bluetooth presence for situated interaction combines very well implicit and explicit forms of interaction in fact blurring the distinction between them. Simply by scanning for Bluetooth devices within the proximity of the mobile device people are already part of the situation and implicitly engaging with the system.

This continuous flow of presence information can be fundamental in the aggregation of situated content and may act as an important catalyst for more explicit forms of interaction. This is what differentiates interactions based on Bluetooth presence from other interactions.

The chosen methodology combines a user defined profile encoded into the Bluetooth enabled device by setting up a user such as a Vehicle Identification Number VIN . With a focus or priority on user privacy the profile is encoded into the user s Bluetooth enabled mobile device with an algorithm sequence protecting the user s privacy.

The disclosed system provides an important and practical implementation of the technique and on its usability within the complex set of social phenomena that characterizes situated interactions in public places without compromising the user s privacy. The effectiveness and simplicity of the disclosed system makes it easily adoptable for applications like localized social networking interactions near field communication like secure transactions payment methods secure recognized methods and triggers secure processes and delivery of direct content according to the user profile or preferences. All of these functions are accomplished without compromising the user s privacy and provides the user with complete control all the time. The method can be integrated and provide privacy and secure transaction to empower applications that may otherwise exploit the user s identification ID the user s profile and the user s privacy such as a method to provide secure payments transactions.

Every day millions of people access the Internet and enter their profile personal information or answer questions about their preferences in order to access a service and or a site to obtain incentives coupons specials and the like. The sites use the information for marketing and in some cases share or sell the acquired information. Recent research has found that most people are willing to give information for incentives.

Using the profile and records collection of Internet surfing habits of the user is one way that search engine companies make money on the Internet. At the same time search engine companies try to direct content to the user according to their profile and or habits.

But what about real life People spend more and more time indoors. According to recent research people spend more than 90 of their time indoors.

A scenario of searching for stores items special sales and coupons according to our desire is repeated again and again. The question is how can the system transfer the success of the Internet marketing tool and the easy search for real life 

That is the main idea behind the navigation system. What if a system can take a profile user statistics and or user input with them anywhere and provide one or more intelligence marketing tools. Moreover the user is in complete control over their privacy as the user can simply turn off or shut down the application.

In the disclosed navigation system the user establishes their profile and or sales preferences which are encoded into the user s cellular telephone to be associated with the proximity beacon identification ID installed in the local area. There are 3 key configurations A. A set key segment where segment keys are not unique and help to setup a user segment only. In this case the key is not unique. B. A unique key wherein a unique key would be a unique identifier which can be analogous to an Internet Protocol IP address. C. A dynamic key and multiple profiles according to a location and or user preferences.

The profile can include gender age and sales preferences interest and does not include any personal profile. It may be the same as seeing the user and recognizing their gender age and other preferences just by looking at the user. The user is not revealing any kind of information that most sites ask for in a registration process. More specifically the profile excludes any personal information like name address or telephone number.

As part of the suite of Location Based Services LBS applications the user s cellular telephone or mobile device will scan the area for the RF tags or beacons. For example by being proximity close to the directory stand in a mall the system will receive and a decode the user s key in order to utilize the user preference segments to trigger delivery of ads specials and incentives to the user in accordance with the user s profile. The disclosed system also provides the business owner or operator with the best marketing tool knowing their customers the customers profiles and habits. This is accomplished using a very low cost Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons installed in the area and an association between the Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons with the user s Bluetooth enabled device such as the user s cellular telephone or mobile device.

The disclosed system provides a solution to Your customer is telling you what they want are you listening 

The main idea behind the disclosed system is to provide the user with pinpoint content according to their desired preferences at the location determined by the identification ID of the RF tag or beacon in the proximity of the user and provide directions or navigation to the desired location to the user for such items as the store sales specials coupons or any other information that the user may be looking for. The disclosed system enables providers to receive meaningful data around shopper habits and store layouts statistics as well as to help them partner up to offer better loyalty incentives to their customers through programs that extend beyond single storefronts. The disclosed system provides sensing of second by second updates of a shoppers interest about specific product place and can provide the business owner or operator with a complete set of marketing tools which were previously unavailable and at the same time provides the user with offers directly from the business according to the user s habits and or preferences profile.

The sales sense is a user preference module which can be an add on to the sales sense marketing where the sales sense joins the user behaviors module to create a very unique Location Based Services LBS business and marketing model. Imagine a potential customer standing in a crowded store aisle feeling overwhelmed by all the choices. What if a business associate could just reach out and give the user something to help with the decision such as a coupon product information discounts and the like in real time Content marketers will soon have the ability to do this and a whole lot more just by implementing the disclosed system.

Sales sense or shopping behavior How consumers decide what to buy and when is going to drastically change. Winning marketing needs to provide and will require getting exactly the right content in the right place at the right time with even more precision. Shoppers will have the ability to collect real time information comparison pricing discounts and other helpful highly tailored data as the shoppers walk through a store or browse near particular items. It will be imperative to produce well timed compelling content that is useful in those crucial moments before a choice is made. Sales sense can become a next generation marketing tools from coupons and giveaways in stores to tours of museums to airports that provide real time flight information. The possibilities are endless.

Consumers will start engaging with content in a whole host of new ways. Rather than just providing information suitable for a web browser or even a mobile user marketers will need to think about ways to provide content that will be of value to users as they live their lives. From businesses to city parks the disclosed system provides a user with tools to access helpful real time data like never before. As recently published research showed that on average people spend 90 of our time indoors. The proposed invention allows an effective integration of on line and off line shopping.

Moreover according to research indoor navigation may be more important than outdoor navigation and may represent a huge new market.

The disclosed technology allows shopping centers malls department stores buildings airports train stations exhibition centers museums and amusement parks to understand the way that customers or passengers flow through the premises. At the same time the disclosed technology provides the user or shopper with a unique indoor navigation capability without compromising user privacy.

The disclosed technology will allow for the first time the navigation and the Global Positioning System GPS industry to tap into the local advertising market estimated to be 134 Billion in the US alone.

The disclosed technology provides a reliable method for identifying the path habits and the behavior that people take through an area. There are a number of advantages to The disclosed technology including 

For retail areas malls in particular the advantages of understanding shopper behavior are significant. Such information can assist the mall to 

The disclosed technology would be the only system on the market that can continuously and accurately gather information on a shopper paths based on locally installed RF tags or beacons without any need to establish any communication relationship between the user s cellular telephone or other mobile device and the RF tag or beacon. This is accomplished without any paring or any other bi directional communication to determine the location and all without compromising the shopper s identification ID or their privacy.

The various methods disclosed can also provide a way of surveying the behavior and preferences of the user s shopper habits simply by observing the signals encoding a Bluetooth naming key transmitted by the user s mobile telephone and associate the Bluetooth naming key with the identification ID of an RF tag or beacon located proximate the user and at the same time provides the shopper with a unique special application for indoor navigation which can trigger Location Based Services LBS applications.

The present invention provides a next generation approach to the Location Based Services LBS market especially respective to indoor applications and to areas where a Global Positioning System GPS cannot provide accurate navigation.

The data collected using the disclosed technology can be used to provide trend reports showing which shops are most visited and at what times whether there are sufficient public facilities to serve the visiting shoppers or whether more security staff are needed to name only a few of the potential benefits. Ultimately the collected data can provide assistance to shopping centers to become more in tune with their customers so that the shopping centers can create better more pleasant places to visit.

The proposed analytics can turn shopping centers department stores or other stores into finely tuned sites enabling operators of the mall or store to direct the flow of traffic efficiently around the information coming from the user to the benefit of the user and the business owner or operator to provide services such as VIP personalize services and the like.

In contrast to alternative techniques there is no device that tracks the user s cellular telephone or other mobile device. In the disclosed methods the user s mobile device or cellular telephone is the one that scans and tracks RF tags or beacons along the route. Each scan includes the beacon s identification ID and the user s mobile device or cellular telephone identification ID and while these keys help track the movement of the signal and the user the disclosed technology doesn t reveal the identity of the user. This is a more precise method than what GOOGLE MAPS uses to detect a general location on a mobile device or cellular telephone by cell towers which are accurate between 300 1000 meters compared to the disclosed technology wherein accuracy which is below 10 meters. The disclosed technology allows the business owner or operator to be notified about the existence of a user in the vicinity of the store and allows sending the user offers deals or more information and at the same time collects information that could be very important to the business owner such as habits profile or preference of the user. This enables an ability to provide precise content directly to the user s cellular telephone or other mobile device.

A user in a mall can use a local guide which could suggest that the user download the navigation application at the mall the building or the facility. Alternatively the navigation application can already include a mapping application.

As part of the application the Bluetooth feature on the user s mobile device will scan for signals from known locations or Bluetooth enabled tags or beacons and will determine the user s location on the local mall map the same way as a Global Positioning System GPS with accuracy of less than 5 meters. More beacons with less signal range equals more accuracy.

For example the Bluetooth enabled tag or beacon can broadcast an RF or beacon signal that includes the position coordinates for example latitude and longitude coordinates of the RF tag or beacon which can be detected by a mobile device. The position coordinates can provide a third location accuracy for the current location of the mobile device by virtue of the mobile device adopting the position coordinates of the beacon as its own position coordinates.

The known locations of a number of RF tags or beacons in a geographic region referred to as a beacon infrastructure can define a geofence that encompasses the geographic region.

In some implementations the beacon can also advertise Location Based Services LBS provided by the beacon infrastructure. Upon determining that the mobile device crossed the geofence defined by the beacon infrastructure. The application can monitor for RF tag or beacon signals and continuously update the location of the mobile device to be the location of the RF tag or beacon currently in proximity with the mobile device.

When the mobile device looses contact with the RF tag or beacon for a defined period of time for example 5 to 10 minutes or when the mobile device exits the geofence boundary defined by the beacon infrastructure the application can transfer the monitoring back to the application subsystem so that the location of the mobile device can be determined using Wi Fi and or Cellular identification ID .

In some implementations the disclosed application can distinguish between RF tags or beacons within the beacon infrastructure and mobile tags or beacons that may be detected during a scanning step such as other Bluetooth enabled mobile telephones operating within the beacon infrastructure.

For example each beacon in the beacon infrastructure can provide data in its broadcast signal that indicates that the beacon is part of a beacon infrastructure.

Alternatively or in addition when a mobile device makes first contact with an RF tag or beacon within the beacon infrastructure that RF tag or beacon can transmit to the mobile device a list of unique identifiers such as an identification ID of the RF tag or beacon of other identifiers ID of other RF tags or beacons within the beacon infrastructure and other information about the beacon infrastructure such as a name geofence data and or one or more websites associated with the beacon infrastructure.

The beacon infrastructure can be located in any geographic region including within businesses such as shopping malls retail stores restaurants landmarks such as museums airports parks entertainment venues and any other environment where Location Based Services LBS are desired.

The disclosed concept offers a complete suite of applications including finding available parking spaces providing navigation of indoor malls or stores and a capacity to navigate to emergency exits all using a low cost solution and with a business model that can be used to attract customers.

The applications represent a big opportunity in the navigation market and will open up new avenues for companies from telephone operators to malls stores department stores merchants owners to navigation and mapping companies.

The disclosed technology presents a low cost and easily deployed infrastructure for location based navigation in both an indoor environment and an outdoor environment without the need for use of the Global Positioning System GPS or access to a cellular network. Moreover the concept is especially suitable for local area services both indoors and outdoors when and where the Global Positioning System GPS and the cellular network can t provide a suitable solution or the degree of accuracy needed to provide such navigation 10 meters or less .

The disclosed technology provides a system based upon existing Bluetooth protocols wherein the Bluetooth technology is proven to be stable simple inexpensive and mature in the market. Moreover it is a common communication tool and is available on more than 85 of all new mobile telephones at the time of the original disclosure.

The infrastructure consists of Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons installed in known locations in a local area. The Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons will respond to Bluetooth device scanning inquiries made by a user s Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone or other Bluetooth enabled device using the special associated application.

Each of the RF tags or beacons encodes information into the naming portion of the beacon signal wherein the encoded information includes the identification ID representing the Location as well as the facility or product type. A mobile device as well as any other Bluetooth enabled device such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a portable computing tablet cars and the like can also become an RF tag or beacon providing a new echo system where an infrastructure can include static and dynamic deployments of RF tags or beacons which interact with one another.

The local area map such as a mall map a store map a building map an area map and the like will be available to be downloaded as part of a mapping system that can automatically trigger a request to download the associate map when a user approaches or passes an entrance of the building the mall any other designated area or the associated directory to provide the mapping for the navigation application or as part of a mapping and navigation application.

A user s Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone will scan the local area for the location of RF tags or beacons located proximate thereto. When a user is within 5 to 10 meters the location beacons respond providing room level navigation accuracy. The beacon identification ID in conjunction with an associated signal strength will provide instant determination of the location of the receiving mobile device. With multiple RF tags or beacons installed and possibly receiving more than one beacon signal a simple triangulation calculation and options for signal strength will determine the exact location of the user on the downloaded map of the local area. It is noted that the process can be completed without establishing any communication or pairing between the beacons and the mobile device. The process does not require any connectivity to the Internet. It is recognized that access to the Internet enables access to additional information when additional information is desired.

When including a list of associated RF tags or beacons other signals not on the list will be ignored. There is a mixed use of RF tags or beacons and delivery option depending on the application. For example in a mall application the stores can have a Wireless Application Protocol WAP or use the Internet to automatically deliver more content by way of a push to a user s mobile device where the RF tags or beacons serve as navigation antennae as well as triggering mechanism to provide application exploit waypoints and content to help the user navigate in the respective area. The applications can include a Sales Sense providing next generation marketing tools a Behavioral Module Nav4Parking Nav4Realty Nav4Mall Nav4Sale Nav4Museurn Nav4Show Nav4Train Nav4Sign Nav4Emergency Return2Parking Nav4Store Nav4Conference Nav4Disney Nav4Events and the like.

Moreover according to research indoor navigation may be more important than outdoor navigation and may represent a huge new market.

At the same time the disclosed technology provides the user or shopper with a unique indoor navigation capability without compromising user privacy.

The technology disclosed herein provides a reliable method for identifying the travel paths habits and the behavior that people take through an area.

For retail areas malls in particular the advantages of understanding behavior of shoppers is significant. Such information can assist the mall in a number of areas.

The disclosed applications enable evaluation and improvement of the retail tenancy mix by identifying which stores shoppers consider to be complementary. The mobile device or cellular telephone scans and tracks RF tags or beacons along the route. Each scan includes the cellular telephone s unique Bluetooth identification ID . While these identifications ID s help track the movement of the signal and its owner they don t reveal the identity of the user. This is a more precise method than what GOOGLE MAPS uses to detect a general location on a mobile telephone using cellular infrastructure towers which is accurate between 300 1000 meters compared to accuracy of the disclosed technology which is below 10 meters.

Some reports about shoppers show how valuable behavioral information actually is and the profit opportunities that come along with this 

The disclosed technology is the only system known today that can continuously and accurately gather information on travel paths of shopper using Bluetooth and or Wi Fi enabled RF tag or beacon technology and all without compromising the shopper s identity ID or his her privacy.

The data collected using the disclosed technology can be used to provide trend reports showing which stores are most visited what times the locations are visited whether there are sufficient public facilities to serve the visiting shoppers or whether more security staff is needed to name only a few of the potential benefits. Ultimately the data made available by the disclosed invention helps shopping centers become more in tune with their customers so the shopping centers can create a better more pleasant place to visit by providing a loyalty and reward program.

Analytics provided by the disclosed applications can turn shopping centers department stores or other stores into finely tuned locations enabling the mall the store or the store owners or operators to direct the flow of traffic efficiently.

In contrast to alternative techniques there is no device that tracks the user s cellular telephone. In the disclosed method the user is willing to give information for incentives.

Using the profile and records the surfing habits of the user such as by tracing activities of the associated Internet Protocol IP address is the way that the search engine companies make money on the Internet. At the same time they try to direct content to the user according to the user s profile or habits. But what about real life People spend more and more time indoors according to recent research people spend more than 90 of their time indoors .

As part of the suite of Location Based Services LBS applications the user s cellular telephone or mobile device will scan the area for RF tags or beacons in the proximity thereof. For example by being in a close proximity to the directory stand in a mall a decoding of the user s key will be processed in order to acquire the user s identity ID and or preference profile. The server will then provide the user with ads specials and incentives according to the user s profile essentially responding to the question Your customer is telling you what they want are you listening 

The main idea behind this is to provide the user with pinpoint content according to the user s desired preferences at the location and also direct or navigate the user to the desired location where the user can find the store sales special coupons or other information that they are looking for. At the same time there is also a benefit to the mall or store owner or operator by getting the next generation s sales tools getting costumers habits and their sale s profile resulting in an ability to better serve better and meet the customer s needs.

The sales sense user preference module is an add on to the sales sense marketing where the sales sense joins the user behaviors module to create a very unique Location Based Services LBS business and marketing model. The analysis of this spatiotemporal data can supply high level human behavior information valuable to urban planners local businesses and the Location Based Services LBS marketing.

The indoor applications and navigation takes a further step to give the user or the shopper next generation shopping tools by providing them with the following indoor applications that could be included in the NAV4MALL or NAV4STORE.

Map and indoor navigation brings the local mall mapping or store mapping to the digital age. This function allows the user to navigate from waypoint to waypoint on the map directory. The function brings the store directory or mall directory to the cellular telephone.

Search and Find provides a capability to locate a store a place an item or a product that would be on the directory represented by waypoints represented by RF tags or beacons on the loading maps.

Sales or specials provides a process for informing the user of discounts sales and coupons. This feature can be an add on or a replacement for the mall or store printed flyers that provide the information to the shoppers at points in the mall or store. The feature can even direct the user or the shopper to the aisle containing the products to coupons and to other items that the shopper is looking for.

Parking and Return2Parking provides a process which assists the user in finding parking spaces and the location of their parked car. It is noted that this function does not directly use the same beacons as the parking the infrastructure employs long range beacons where in a store or a mall the beacons can be a shorter range version.

Info or information is a function where the system provides information about events restrooms ATM locations a seating area a kid s playground a fountain public telephones and the like.

Emergency is a very important component of the disclosed innovation. The emergency function provides a unique alarm and notification to the user without depending on other communication links such as cellular telephones that are prone to failure in an emergency condition. The present invention provides the user with an associated emergency procedure within the building the mall the store or any other place during an emergency condition where the information will help navigate the user to safety.

Panic portion of NAV4emergency allows the user to transmit a signal requesting to be located in an emergency. The signal would include information pertaining to the user s location.

Regarding privacy the system does not collect personal information such as user s name or telephone number. It does however record the cellular telephone s Bluetooth identification number or other identifier to build a profile of the user or the use of the cellular telephone in the area. It is analogous to surfing the web where a user s Internet Protocol IP address is recorded for future marketing statistics and surfing habits with permission from the user . Also as part of the encoding key into the Bluetooth device such as the user s profile as described above can be included to enhance privacy and security to the level where viewing the key broadcasted by the Bluetooth device doesn t reveal any user identification unless the user requests to be registered to receive incentives specials sales and the like. Even then the users name or other personal information is secure and only the Bluetooth device key or identification ID is recorded.

By directly targeting the consumer standing adjacent to or within a business an event or approaching a kiosk or restaurant merchants can maximize their marketing budget while incorporating this new inexpensive and effective form of advertising.

The user is in complete control. The user can disable their Bluetooth application at any time or just reject content. The system avoids spam and the user is attracted by incentives rather than generic promotions. In a mall like environment an incentive to a user to use the disclosed technology can be further enhanced with the use of the associated key advantages and packages.

Isn t this all a bit like big brother Not at all and it isn t even little brother The system simply logs the movement of a cellular telephone around an area and aggregates this to provide trend data for businesses. The process is much less intrusive or invasive than existing methods that are already in widespread use. For instance Closed circuit television CCTV cameras and number plate monitoring collect personal information such as your image or car number plate. The disclosed technology represents the next generation shopping experience in shopping centers malls or stores and fits very well with today s business model. Such a service can be offered for free to the users and would be backed by advertising and the use of the data by the stores.

Who benefits from the disclosed technology Everyone benefits from the trend data collected. The process enables a way to collect instant feedback from shoppers without having to bother them for information. In the old days centers would have used researchers to survey consumers but this information takes time to collate and response rates are very low these days as shoppers have increasingly become reluctant to stop and share their feedback. Hence the disclosed innovation provides a very effective method in the same way that television TV networks know how many people watched particular programs and use that information to discern what programs to produce and how to calculate the costs advertisers must pay to promote their products during different timeslots. The system provides the equivalent for shopping center operators and their resident retailers. It is believed that introducing the proposed system and marketing tools described above can help users and merchants upgrade the real shopping experience of today with the advantage of the web like tools.

The disclosed innovation represents the next generation shopping experience in shopping centers and malls and fits very well within today s business model. Such a service can be offered for free to the users and backed by advertising and the use of the data by the stores. Such service applications and the ability to include the emergency functions will also ease the fear of locating a user or any privacy issue.

For the first time the shopper will experience Internet type marketing in the traditional sales and advertising venue.

It is believed that shopping should be an enjoyable pastime. Who wants to go to shopping center that are congested poorly laid out have dirty toilets are badly positioned for transport links and which pose a security threat to visitors All together this makes for a much better shopping experience.

How do shopping center owners and retailers benefit The benefits for shopping center owners of using the disclosed technology are huge as there are many possible uses for the information gathered. The disclosed applications can help shopping center owners or operators get a better understanding of how people use their center such as the order of stores the shoppers visit and the time the shoppers spend in different areas of the shopping center.

These days visits to shopping malls are falling with increased competition from supermarkets retail parks and the Internet. With a decrease in visit frequency it is critical that the shopper s experience at the mall is exceptional and that is where the disclosed applications come in. The information can assists malls at all levels from the very mundane to the more strategic questions that they face such as whether or not the shopping mall has the right mix of retailers.

Similarly the disclosed technology could help museums identify their most popular exhibits and help exhibition companies plan their venues more carefully around visitor traffic flows.

The disclosed technology is able to provide a solution with quantitative feedback on whether the changes management makes in the mall are successful. One of the ways to do this is by simply looking at how long shoppers tend to stay within a mall.

Don t retailers already measure shopper numbers Yes they have infrared cameras and counting machines which monitor and count the numbers of visitors to their stores. This measure is known as footfall and has been used by retailers for many years. The disclosed system provides another level of data by looking at the aggregate paths that mobile telephone carrying visitors take and the length of time they spend in each location which is commonly known as dwell time.

In the past malls have focused solely on looking at the numbers of shoppers that they are drawing through the doors footfall but when combined with dwell time they can get a much more accurate predictor of their performance.

The system has no idea who the user is an individual. The system only looks at the path the user s cellular telephone or other mobile device takes. Essentially it s like looking at a dot moving around a screen. In isolation this information isn t too interesting until you look at the wider patterns and trends and see lots of dots taking the same route or visiting the same areas of the mall.

What is the Bluetooth identification ID number A Bluetooth identification ID is like the Internet Protocol IP number in a computer network or the Internet which does not contain or reveal the user s telephone number that the cellular network operator uses to identify your telephone. The disclosed system utilized the identification ID information as one key to find and detect the user.

The linkage between this identifier and your personal information is very critical to the business owner as it can provides a user s habits preferences and when available a user s profile. The disclosed system provides a new breed of tools to the business owner or operator just by getting to know where the user is and at the same time the system provides the user with the best VIP like personalize shopping services.

The disclosed applications do not detect or acquire any personal information and have absolutely no idea who the user is as an individual. Although the applications include an option for users to register as mall or store customers to provide more details about the user still no real ID the process would be analogous to a membership card that will provide the user with incentives coupons or special discounts if the user participates. Moreover recent emergency events prove the need for emergency and notification to the right people at the right time by keeping the key identification ID of the Bluetooth devices that are in the area or facility. For example the disclosed NAV4emergency feature can provide instant alarming and notification and navigation to the exit route and to safety. Again all of this can be accomplished without revealing the user s identity ID or breaching privacy of the users.

The business model referred to as Next Generation Marketing is analogous to web advertising and the main focus of search engine success which is based on technology that tracks the web user s habits and provides the user with ads related to the user s interests.

Using the disclosed infrastructure of Bluetooth enabled RF tags or beacons wherein the beacons are deployed about in a mall a store or a shopping center environment. The disclosed invention represents a very unique ability to bring a web like shopping experience by its ability to acquire and store the user s surfing or shopping habits in the shopping center the mall or the store. The disclosed invention will provide a better shopping experience coupons specials sales according to the user s shopping habits and service to the shopper.

It is believed that introducing the disclosed system and the associated marketing tools above can help the users and the sellers to enhance the current shopping experience by introducing an advantage of the web like tools.

The disclosed innovation provides valuable solutions that enhance the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. The ability to optimize performance in real time has a positive effect on advertiser s satisfaction. The fact that this service is well integrated into the disclosed system is a tremendous advantage.

The disclosed innovation is a performance enhancing technology providing great data and allowing improved customer service.

The disclosed innovation can provide an extremely effective way to optimize the performance of offline or online advertising campaigns in the mall or store environment. For excellence in client services the idea is a clear win win for everyone.

Helping to understand where users are going in the mall or store in real life and the shoppers buying behavior patterns will allow the merchants to continually adjust offers placements and creative content to improve buying through and maximize sales.

The disclosed technology will evolve mobile content into a bonfire revenue center that will benefit the shopping mall operator and merchants alike.

The user is in complete control. The user can disable their Bluetooth application at any time or just reject content. There is no spam and the user is attracted by incentives rather than generic promotions. Probably the best technical analogy would be to compare the disclosed technology with existing web based systems that measure viewers of web sites for example GOOGLE ANALYTICS.

For example the Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon can broadcast an RF signal that includes its position coordinates such as latitude longitude which can be detected by a Bluetooth enabled mobile device. The position coordinates can provide a third location accuracy for the current location of the mobile device by virtue of the mobile device adopting the position coordinates of the beacon as its own position coordinates.

The system use and costs should scale well with its ability for multi use in an emergency and in a non emergency to provide local navigation on malls stores campuses buildings hospitals hotels and the like using the Bluetooth enabled RF tag or beacon for navigation. Some of the key applications are 

NAV4Mall NAV4Store NAV4Sale or just University or Building Navigator explore the indoor environment. These features navigate the user to the right place the store or the department the user is looking for. These features provide navigation using the mall map or store mapping to find the user s way around. This is accomplished by using the user s cellular telephone or other navigation system without assistance from the Global Positioning System GPS . A new kind of service and new marketing way for the malls or store business owners an add on to local advertising.

With an indoor navigation based on the local map or mall layout that will provide the user with navigation to the user s desired location in the mall or store and receives content according to the user s preferences or habits. The user can be directed to a store the product the isle inside the store containing the desired product and the like.

The disclosed system provides a new way of subway or bus mapping including indoor and or outdoor environments directly to the user s navigation device or cellular telephone. Every day millions of people are using the mass transportation system trains subways buses and the like. Each of the passengers depends on the transportation map for the route information schedules and additional services provided by the transportation system. Most of today s passengers carry a cellular telephone with them.

The disclosed methods can be used by the management of the transportation system train buses taxi and road management where the RF tags or beacons can be installed in any transportation facility or entity. The disclosed method can provide traffic and on demand transportation requests. The disclosed method can provide online real time traffic and transportation head count of the mobile devices existing in the local area according to an association with a proximity to the RF tags or beacons installed in the transportation entity in association with transportation infrastructure. The disclosed method can provide information pertaining to parking traffic conditions signs schedules and time to station. The disclosed method can determine how many people are at the station the bus stop or at any other congregating area to create an on demand service for taxi and or public services.

Aside from such data gathering and the importance of such statistically information to manage the flow of transportation in a local area the RF tags or beacons serve as sensors to detect the traffic in a specific area. The status can be monitored by collecting how many mobile devices are in the specific area. In event of emergency the disclosed system can provide emergency notification and alarming the local mobile devices.

The disclosed method can be used to manage transportation and provide automatic awareness to transportation management and or operators as well as the user on the road. The user can automatically get information about traffic in their area generated from other associates. The user s cellular telephone identification ID and or the car using the VIN broadcasting method can be employed as an RF tag or beacon. RF tags or beacons can be installed along a roadway automatically generating traffic information by tracking the existence of users in the area and proximity to the RF tags or beacons installed along the road within a transportation facility at an intersection and the like. Infrastructure of wireless RF tags or beacons benefit transportation industry managements by providing automatic crowd sourcing data from users along the road by acquiring the user s identification ID and determining their proximity to fixed RF tags or beacons. This collected data can be presented as a statistically view as data guttering for events like traffic on the road automatically. Adding such technology and infrastructure into the roads may take time so the use of the driver and passenger or the pedestrian cellular telephone as a beacon and as automatic traffic notification can provide instant infrastructure providing an immediate dynamic deployment for the benefit of the transportation network and the drivers. Mobile devices of the driver the passenger and or the car can be utilized as a RF tag or beacon and become a part of the automatic transportation system to alert for traffic and road safety conditions. The process can provide automatic car to car notification of traffic conditions and road information.

In an emergency the NAV4emergency would also be available.

The disclosed idea of implementing RF tags or beacons along the roads and within transportation facilities is designed to reduce the growing congestion on the roads. By providing tools to create an intelligent transportation system the implementation of beacons can be part of a car installed in red lights along the road or within the transportation facility such a system can be installed along a bus route in a bus station in a subway or in any other transportation entity wherein the system provides real time online reports including a status if the transportation systems are empty or filled with travelers. The system can provide an automatic response from the user s or car s mobile device associated with the RF tags or beacons installed in the bus station or train station. The information will allow transportation control that can replace what is currently being used which requires installation and support of high cost camera and or sensors. In an alternative solution used today traffic monitoring relies upon manually collect information from users which employ the Global Positioning System GPS to acquire their locations and movements. It is noted that the Global Positioning System GPS is not available for indoor environments or provides accurate information. In a simple explanation the user mobile telephone automatically transmits their beacon identification ID . More of the same beacon identification ID reported in the same area is understood to be a traffic condition or slow moving head count of cars travelers or the like in the transportation facility or the entity area. In a way the disclosed method provides an automatic waze system. Such a system can replace exiting sensors and provides the user and or the transportation management with the ability to know exactly where the bus the train the subway are at any point in time. The data can used for the schedule or on demand public transportation like sending a bus or taxi to an area according to the demand in the area. Such a method can provide the user traffic and transportation information where the user plays a big part of the process and the process is not dependent upon a manual transfer of information which has been proven to be not accurate enough.

One application creates an echo system where the drivers of cars and the transportation entity are all integrated for an intelligent transportation system of tomorrow and all based on the same concept of infrastructure on RF tags or beacons used to collect information to generate statics. Alternatively or in addition to the infrastructure the system can employ dynamic beacons where the user s mobile device or cellular telephone as well as the navigation components within the car are integrated part of such system. It is understood that a mobile device or any other Bluetooth enabled device such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a portable computing tablet cars and the like can become a beacon providing a new echo system where an infrastructure can include both static fixed and dynamic moving deployments of beacons which interact with each other. Again deploying such technology and fixed infrastructure into the roads may take time so the use of the driver the passenger or the pedestrian cellular telephones or mobile devices as an RF tag or beacon and as automatic traffic notification can provide instant infrastructure. This would provide an immediate dynamic deployment for the benefit of the transportation as well as the drivers.

The disclosed system provides the next cellular telephone or mobile device killer application. Emerging technology markets are always on the lookout for that elusive killer application the precious irrefutable application that makes adopters stand up take notice and open their wallets. Once it s found and as soon as adopters realize firsthand the value to be achieved that killer application eventually expands into other more advanced areas of adoption and innovation.

Hotel resort and cruise ship A good example of use can be referred to as Nav4Hotel Nav4Resort or Nav4Cruise ship. The proposed system and infrastructure can include a series of installed RF tags or beacons in such places as cruise ships hotels resorts and other hospitality facilities to benefit the hospitality business and the guest.

The subject invention creates infrastructure of RF tags or beacons in the facility the hotel the resort and the cruise ship areas. The infrastructure of RF tags or beacons would be integrated with an existing hospitality system and provide a trigger mechanism when the existence of the traveler or guest is detected.

The association between the guest s mobile device or cellular telephone or the hospitality employee mobile device or cellular telephone and the RF tags or beacons will allow the example option below. As such there are two parts for the system to work a the infrastructure of the RF tags or beacons installed in the hotel the resort or the cruise ship and b the guest s or employee s Bluetooth and or Wi Fi enabled mobile device or cellular telephone in conjunction with the associated application. Again it is noted that the system can work without Internet access and or cellular communication and can utilize an existing Wi Fi based system in conjunction with local servers.

It is believed that the disclosed invention will meet the desire of hospitality service providers to increase their average revenue per user.

The main object of the present invention is to provide the indoor guide navigation and a special application for indoor use without the need for any Global Positioning System GPS communication.

It another object of the present invention to provide a method of providing special indoor application using Bluetooth and or Wi Fi enabled RF tags or beacons in conjunction with Bluetooth enabled devices especially the cellular telephone.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a method using a special application for local business malls departments stores regular stores buildings downtown centers or any other facility area especially but not limited to indoor environments. The application triggers activities based upon the identification ID of detected RF tags or beacons located in the area.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a marketing method especially but not limited for the Location Based Services LBS market.

The foregoing and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing an infrastructure of Bluetooth enabled tags or beacons installed in known locations within the area or facility. Each RF tag or beacon is assigned its own unique identification ID to identify the location in the area. The RF tags or beacons broadcast the identification ID to be pickup by the Bluetooth enabled cellular telephone or mobile device.

An indoor mapping or mapping images of the area or facility will be part of the application and can be downloaded before arriving to the area or facility or triggered to be automatically download when the user approaches or is within the area.

The application on the cellular telephone or other Bluetooth enabled device will scan the area or facility for the beacon signal emitted from the RF tags or beacons wherein the beacon signal includes the identification ID or name. When a Bluetooth enabled tag or beacon identification ID matches one on a list the user s mobile device responds to the proximity detection and determines a signal strength that may be used to calculate a distance. When more than one beacon signal is received the application can complete a simple triangulation algorithm to determine the current location of the mobile device. Other Bluetooth devices that are not on the list would be filtered out.

One the location of the mobile device is established the location can be displayed on the map. And because the location of the other RF tags or beacons are known navigation between the current location and a desired RF tag or beacon that represents a waypoint is easy to achieve. In reality no communication is established between the RF tags or beacons and the cellular telephone or other mobile device.

The disclosed innovation reverses the current idea of locating the user by letting the user navigate according to the beacon signals transmitted by the Bluetooth enabled tags or beacons wherein the beacon signals are sent by way points directly to the user s mobile device. This will enable Location Based Services LBS navigation even indoors without use of the Global Positioning System GPS or the cellular communication network. The disclosed invention can also be adapted to enable triggering of applications and or create a link to an existing system and software.

The RF tags or beacons can reach from long distance depending on the application and the antenna used by the RF tag or beacon. To get more accuracy less range and more beacons may needed to achieve an accuracy of 10 meter or less which provides a more than sufficient accuracy for navigation within a building a room or any other indoor environment. Getting more range to the box is as simple as attaching a bigger antenna or including a power buster to increase the signal.

The user can choose to be registered which would provide membership privileges identify the registrant as a student in a university a school or an employee in a business. This provides advantages especially for receiving direct incentives specials coupons and the like. Additionally the registration would provide benefits associated with a full NAV4emergency protection.

The disclosed applications lets the user choose to participate and receive incentives specials sales coupons and local content tailored towards the user s preferences all for free. Alternatively the user can choose not to participate and pay a small fee for the service and the software. In any case the user s privacy remains protected to the highest level compared to any normal daily use of the Internet.

There is also a great benefit to the user participating as the user can have full emergency notification directly to the user s telephone. In an emergency the user can be directed within the area building mall or store and provide navigation to the user along an exit route in accordance with the emergency procedure. This feature will be available to the user even if the cellular network fails due to power outages or the high volume of network traffic which commonly occurs during an emergency situation.

In the disclosed method there is no detector or tracking for the user the user themselves engages the scanning and detecting method to find the RF tags or beacons in the area using the user s mobile device with the proximity scan of local RF tags or beacons providing the triggering mechanism.

In summary the proposed solutions provide a full suite of applications for the benefit of the user from parking to sales specials indoor navigation general informed and notification in an emergency condition and directed to the exit route to safety.

The disclosed method can be attractive not only for shopping malls department stores or downtown strips but also to high rise buildings commercial buildings universities schools museums amusements parks trains subways and hotels. It can also be attractive to search engines advertising companies cellular telephone operators manufactures Global Positioning System GPS companies mapping local businesses local advertising Location Based Services LBS and the like. The disclosed method can give the Location Based Services LBS a new meaning a business model that s made easy.

A facet of behavioral targeting has been around for a while but mostly online but it s been gaining traction among advertising agencies retargeting program which is now a key planning consideration for advertisers.

Why The primary reason is because retargeting is a powerful means to bring lift to advertising campaign results generating higher conversion rates and lowering acquisition costs. You can t be much more effective advertising than advertising that targets a person who has shown an interest in a product but didn t buy with a related advertising that then gets him to buy right It generally fails to tap the unique opportunities of local advertising market estimates to be over 150 Billion in US alone although people are spending more than 90 of their time indoors there is no clear technology to provide indoor navigation and not a clear business model. Advertisers and the business are disillusioned with the promise of Location Based Services LBS but are still longing for a solution that properly addresses the significant audience represented by the explosion of cellular telephones use and the availability of content.

It is understood that the disclosed innovation technology and business model can provide the next generation method for the Location Based Services LBS market to tap into the huge market opportunities.

The disclosed methods represent a very unique way of locating the exact location of the user through the mobile device . In the disclosed method the user scans the area for a known list of RF tags or beacons. The user controls the scanning of the area for the known identification ID types of RF tags or beacons. In reality bi directional communication or pairing does not need to be established between the user and the RF tags or beacons. The user s mobile device scans the area for a known RF tags or beacons and the process of determining the location of the mobile device is accomplished using the identification ID of the RF tag or beacon and signal strength thereof to determine a the proximity to the RF tag or beacon. This process provides an accuracy of less than 5 meter.

Added to the navigation feature is a special indoor application designed especially for indoor environments stores mall shoppers including features such as finding where the user parked their car finding or search of directory or receiving an emergency alarming and notification.

Moreover this innovation is not dependant upon cellular communications or the Internet for the method of detecting the RF tags or beacons and there is no need for a central system or expensive infrastructure. In fact the user s mobile device or cellular telephone as well as deployed RF tags or beacons creating the infrastructure each has at least one battery built in and can work even if the electricity in the area is out which is very important in emergency situations.

Moreover the sale sense marketing method comprises a unique way of delivering local content advertising coupons special sales etc. pin point according to the user s identity ID and or profile preference that can be a record of behavioral activity and will provide simple and secure method for targeting user for Location Based Services LBS and other services replacing like near field communication for marketing and even payments transactions.

The disclosed innovation provides a full line of indoor navigation application especially to places or areas that are either indoors or outdoors.

An indoor navigation system may include a navigation computer and an arrival detection system. The navigation computer may be configured to receive a destination to which a user of the mobile navigation system wishes to travel and to provide guidance to the user about how to navigate to the destination. The arrival detection system may be configured to automatically detect when the mobile navigation system has arrived at the destination by being in a proximity to an RF tag or beacon identification ID in the local area. The detection system is based on a sense or scan of the existence of RF tags or beacons installed in the local area and would be configured to wirelessly automatically transmit an arrival notice indicating when the user detects the existence of an RF tag or beacon in the proximity thereof thus determining that the user has arrived at the destination in response to a detection of the user in the area by the detection system based upon the arrival of the mobile navigation system at the destination.

The mobile navigation system may be part of a cellular telephone or any navigation device using a Bluetooth function. Part of the detection application is a notification system configured to wirelessly transmit the RF tag or beacon identification ID of the RF tag or beacon in the vicinity and to associate the mobile device s identification ID of the user to determine the exact location of the user. This enables any of a variety of functions.

In one example the check in process provides an arrival notice to a representative of an airline. The arrival notice may be configured to automatically check the user into a flight of the airline.

In a second example the system may be configured to wirelessly transmit the arrival notice to a representative of a hotel. The arrival notice may be configured to automatically check the user into the hotel.

In another example the system may be configured to wirelessly transmit the arrival notice to a representative of a food service.

In yet another example the arrival notice may be configured to trigger payment for merchandise or a service.

In yet another example the arrival notice may be configured to trigger the delivery of merchandise or a service to a vehicle in which the user is traveling. The arrival notice may include information about the location of the vehicle.

In yet another example the arrival notice may be configured to trigger delivery of promotional items to the user wherein the promotional items can be relating to an establishment at or near the destination.

In yet another example the system may be configured to wirelessly transmit the arrival notice to a representative of a conference that has been scheduled to take place at the destination.

In yet another example the system may be configured to wirelessly transmit the arrival notice to multiple recipients. The multiple recipients may include attendees of a conference that has been scheduled to take place at the destination.

In yet another example the system may be configured to wirelessly transmit the arrival notice to a localized social networking site in a fashion that causes notice of the arrival of the user to be published by the localized social networking site.

To ensure privacy the system may be configured to ask the user for permission to transmit the arrival notice.

In yet another example the system may be configured to automatically transmit the arrival notice upon detection by the arrival detection system of the arrival of the mobile navigation system at the destination.

At the time the navigation computer receives the destination to which the user wishes to travel the system may be configured to ask the user whether the user wants the arrival notice to be transmitted in response to detection by the arrival detection system of the arrival of the mobile navigation system at the destination.

The system may include a global user setting which a user may set to automatically transmit or not transmit arrival notices in response to detection by the arrival detection system of the arrival of the mobile navigation system at destinations.

The system may be configured to ask the user to where it should transmit the arrival notice to receive information indicative of this requested location from the user and to transmit the arrival notice to this location.

The system can create and utilize a network which is referred to as dynamic deployment. The system will use the built in Bluetooth protocol stack module that is able to simultaneously interconnect with other local devices such as portable cellular telephones in a piconet over the local area. The simultaneous connectivity limit of eight 8 devices at a time is overturned by the ability of creating a plurality of piconets which operate in a close proximity. It is understood that the Bluetooth enabled devices such as portable cellular telephones can rapidly move from one piconet to another. In fact the Bluetooth devices only need to remain a member of one piconet for the period of time required to complete one communication transaction. So the Bluetooth enabled devices can join and leave a local piconet frequently effectively overcoming the eight 8 device limit. It is noted even without the option to use a long range Bluetooth antenna the configuration can effectively reach an unlimited distance.

The proposed invention provides an ability to form a wireless ad hoc Bluetooth network or networks based on a collection of Bluetooth enabled mobile devices that dynamically form a temporary network as long as these device are within a sufficient range of one another such as inside a room inside a building along a road inside a store or inside mall. The flexibility of the ad hoc network is what makes it a suitable choice for emergency deployment scenarios where multiple devices would be deployed in a proximity area that is designated as an emergency. The ad hoc network provides a new way of distributing emergency and alert information directly to those in the needed area.

Moreover based upon normal human behavior there is no need to inform everyone in a full room or requiring all of the proximity devices participating in the network to be informed for example in emergency . If only a few people within the occupied room are informed or receive the emergency information on their portable cell telephone they will convey the information to others located in the area.

The same method and idea is mimicked by the concept of dynamic deployment. The concept can be paralleled as a new way to deliver critical emergency alarming and notification without infrastructure in the localized area.

Moreover the limitation of Bluetooth coverage can be overcome by utilizing the capabilities of the Bluetooth protocol in the methods described above. For example in a very large conference location the localized Bluetooth network piconet can join each other and form a larger network that covers the entire facility which is much larger than the limited coverage of a single Bluetooth device. Portable cellular telephones located at one end of the facility can communicate with a second Bluetooth enabled device located at the opposite end where the communication traffic is relayed by one or more intermediary bridging devices. Any Bluetooth enabled device such as the exemplary Bluetooth enabled cellular telephones can become the bridging device s . The cellular telephone user does not need to know whether their device is acting as a bridging device as the process is established and functions automatically as part of the Bluetooth protocol stack routine. In effect the process does not change any internal behavior of the Bluetooth.

And again there is no need to reach all the people with an emergency or other message. If the message were conveyed to only a few in a room at least a portion of those would inform the remaining people of the emergency message.

Moreover the present innovation will allow the user to use a local instant emergency messaging system. The dynamic deployment configuration provides the ability for people to communicate with one another in the same local proximity using Bluetooth enabled devices where the people can chat and exchange important messaging for free. This would be accomplished exclusive of a need for a cellular network. Just think what can be done in an emergency or in an army deployment as other communication method.

From the old days in history humans used messengers to deliver news and information. The disclosed invention uses applies these older concepts to a device that will make it easy to distribute and broadcast the information around using the messengers as the mobile emergency notification as referred to as dynamic deployment.

These as well as other components steps features objects benefits and advantages will now become clear from a review of the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments the accompanying drawings and the claims.

In all the figures of the drawings subfeatures and integral parts that correspond to one another bear the same reference symbol.
