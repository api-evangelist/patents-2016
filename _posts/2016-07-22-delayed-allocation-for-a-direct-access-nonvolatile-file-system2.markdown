The present disclosure is generally related to data storage management and is more specifically related to optimizing the creation and storage of file objects.

Many computer systems manage data storage using an operating system and one or more file systems. The computer system may create modify and remove files from a file system that is stored on a secondary storage e.g. hard disk . To enhance performance of the file system an operating system may use a portion of memory as a page cache to buffer reads and writes to the file system. The page cache may enable the operating system to delay operations e.g. reads and writes so that multiple operations can be executed together. Traditional operating systems typically store the page cache in volatile memory e.g. main memory and the file system in secondary storage e.g. hard disk .

Described herein are methods and systems for data storage management technology that optimize the creation and storage of file objects. Many operating systems support the creation of files using a delayed disk allocation technique. The delayed disk allocation technique which may also be known as allocate on flush is a disk optimization that initially creates a file in a page cache residing in volatile memory and delays committing the file to disk until all the file data has been received. The delay enables the operating system to determine the size of the file and find locations on disk that can accommodate the file and therefore reduce storage fragmentation. Waiting for the file data may be time consuming and the collective file data from many new files may occupy a large portion of page cache. Some modern operating systems have begun incorporating support for direct access non volatile memory that allows an entire file system to be stored in memory and may eliminate the need to have page cache which may prevent an operating system from using the traditional delayed disk allocation technique and may eventually contribute to more storage fragmentation.

Aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by providing an enhanced delayed allocation technique. In one example a computing device may include a first data storage and a second data storage. The first data storage may be volatile memory e.g. main memory and the second data storage may be non volatile memory. The computing device may receive a request to create a file object and receive multiple portions of the file object. The file object may be a data structure for organizing and storing data and may be a file a directory or other object of a data storage system e.g. file system . The computing device may store a first portion of the file object in a buffer in a first data storage and may predict a size of the file object based on the first portion. The computing device may identify a location in the second data storage based on the predicted size and may migrate the first portion from the buffer to the location in the second data storage. During the migration the computing device may update the buffer to indicate the new location of the first portion in the second data storage. Subsequent portions of the file object may be directly stored in the second data storage without storing it in the buffer in the first data storage. This may be advantageous because the first data storage may be main memory and this technology may reduce the quantity and duration that the main memory is occupied during the creation of files and may also reduce storage fragmentation of the newly created file objects. This may enable computer systems to use their computing and storage resources more efficiently e.g. reduce resource waste and may provide faster access times e.g. read or write for file objects since they may be stored in a more continuous manner.

Various aspects of the above referenced methods and systems are described in details herein below by way of examples rather than by way of limitation. The examples provided below discuss a virtualized environment but other examples may include a standard operating system running on an individual computing device without virtualization e.g. without a hypervisor .

Virtualization manager may be hosted by a computing device and include one or more computer programs executed by the computing device for centralized management of the distributed system . In one implementation the virtualization manager may comprise various interfaces including administrative interface reporting interface and or application programming interface API to communicate with computing device as well as to user portals databases directory servers and various other components which are omitted from for clarity.

Computing device may comprise one or more processors communicatively coupled to memory devices and input output I O devices as described in more details herein below with references to . Computing device may run a hypervisor that provides computing resources to one or more virtual machines . Hypervisor may be any program or combination of programs and may run on a host operating system or may run directly on the hardware e.g. bare metal hypervisor . Hypervisor may manage and monitor various aspects of the operation of computing device including the storage memory and network interfaces. Hypervisor may abstract the physical layer features such as processors memory and I O devices and present this abstraction as virtual devices to a virtual machine running an Operating system and user space programs .

Operating system and user space programs may be any program or combination of programs that are capable of using the virtual devices provided by hypervisor to perform computing tasks. Operating system may include a kernel comprising one or more kernel space programs e.g. memory driver network driver file system driver for interacting with virtual hardware devices or actual hardware devices e.g. para virtualization . User space programs may include programs that are capable of being executed by operating system and in one example may be an application program for interacting with a user. Both the operating system and user space programs may be capable of initiating the creation of file objects and may support direct access memory operations A and B for accessing one or more data storage devices.

Direct access memory operations A and B may enable a program to modify a data storage device without interacting with an underlying operating system e.g. underlying kernel . In one example direct access memory operations A and B may enable user space program to access a data storage device without interacting with guest operating system . In another example direct access memory operations A and B may enable guest operating system to access a data storage device without interacting with hypervisor . In yet another example direct access memory operations A and B may enable user space program to access a data storage device without interacting with a guest operating system or hypervisor .

Direct access memory operations A and B may be contrasted to non direct access memory which may use multiple calls across multiple computing layers to modify a data storage device. For example user space program may utilize a non direct access by making a first memory call e.g. system call to underlying guest operating system and the guest operating system may make a second memory call e.g. hypercall to hypervisor . Hypervisor may then make a third memory call e.g. hardware specific load instruction to modify the data storage device. In contract direct memory access operations A and B may enable a program to modify the data storage devices such as first data storage and second data storage without using intermediate memory calls e.g. second and third memory calls .

Support for direct access memory operations A and B may be provided by a direct access module which may include features functions libraries or other instructions that are a part of accessible to or executed by a user space program e.g. application operating system e.g. kernel hypervisor e.g. hypervisor including underlying host operating system or a combination thereof. In one example a direct access memory operation may be initiated by making a memory call e.g. function call that bypasses the operating system and or hypervisor and initiates a firmware or hardware based memory instruction of the data storage device e.g. load or store instruction . Direct access memory operations A and B may be processed by the same central processing unit CPU executing the operating system or hypervisor and may therefore be different then direct memory access DMA . Direct memory access and direct access memory may be different because direct memory access DMA is a hardware feature that enables a hardware subsystem e.g. graphics card network card to modify main memory without interacting with any central processing unit CPU whereas direct access memory may use a CPU but bypass any or all of the computing processes associated with an underlying or supporting program e.g. operating system hypervisor .

First data storage and second data storage may be any data storage device that is capable of storing data for a file object. In one example first data storage and second data storage may be separate data storage devices and first data storage may be volatile data storage and the second data storage may be non volatile data storage. In another example first data storage and second data storage may be different portions of the same storage device which may be either volatile data storage or non volatile data storage. Volatile data storage may include main memory and the non volatile data storage may include non volatile memory NVM . Non volatile memory may be computing memory that can provide stored information after being power cycled e.g. turned off and back on . The non volatile memory may be direct access memory which may be also known as DAX memory e.g. Direct Access eXcited memory .

Direct access memory DAX may include non volatile or volatile memory that supports direct access memory operations and therefore exposes load and store instructions that can be accessed by user or kernel space programs without making a system call or hypercall to an underlying kernel. Direct access memory that uses volatile memory may use the volatile memory in a manner that emulates non volatile memory. Computing device may emulate non volatile memory by persisting the data in the volatile memory to a data structure e.g. file on persistent data storage e.g. secondary storage . This may enable data storage to appear to a program as non volatile memory because it may provide access speeds similar to non volatile memory and provide access to the data after a power cycle. It may be advantageous to use direct access memory for second data storage when creating a file object. This is because the calling process may be able to initiate the creation of a file object using an underlying kernel and main memory but after the first portion of the file object is migrated the calling process can directly write the remaining portions of the file object without involving the underlying kernel or main memory.

As shown in first data storage may include a buffer and second data storage may include file system . Buffer may include one or more data structures that store file object data before during or after it is committed to file system . Buffer may be a transparent or intermediate cache that stores data of file system . In one example buffer may be the same or similar to a page cache or disk cache that stores data from secondary storage so that future requests for that data can be served more quickly from the page cache as opposed to contacting secondary storage to fulfill each request.

File system may be stored in second data storage secondary storage or a combination of both. In one example the file system may be entirely stored in non volatile direct access memory of second data storage and may be considered a non volatile file system. A non volatile file system may be a file system that operates without an intermediate page cache.

In one example buffer may be a shared buffer e.g. shared page cache . The shared buffer may be managed by hypervisor and may include data that is shared across one or more virtual machines . In one example the shared buffer may include data that is common to multiple virtual machines such as common data structures e.g. files common libraries e.g. shared objects SO dynamic link libraries DLLs common configurations e.g. settings other information or a combination thereof. The common data may be provided as read only or may be modifiable by one or more of the virtual machines . When the data in first data storage or second data storage is modified the computing device may synchronize the modified data e.g. modified disk image A with the corresponding data in secondary storage .

Secondary storage may include any physical storage device that is capable of storing data and providing shared access to data storage space by one or more computing devices. Secondary storage may include block based storage devices file based storage devices or a combination thereof. Block based storage devices may include one or more data storage devices e.g. Storage Area Network SAN devices and provide access to consolidated block based e.g. block level data storage. Block based storage devices may be accessible over a network and may appear to an operating system of a computing device as locally attached storage. File based storage devices may include one or more data storage devices e.g. Network Attached Storage NAS devices and provide access to consolidated file based e.g. file level data storage that may be accessible over a network.

As shown in secondary storage may include disk images A N storage metadata and storage lease . In one example secondary storage may employ block based storage and disk images A N storage metadata and storage lease may be provided by respective logical volumes. In another example secondary storage may employ file based storage and disk images A N storage metadata and storage lease may be provided by one or more respective files.

Disk images A N also referred to as a virtual disk image may comprise one or more volumes for storing disk image data. Each disk image may represent a chain of volumes comprising one or more copy on write COW volumes which may also be referred to as layers . From the perspective of virtual machine the volumes may appear as a single disk image as hypervisor presents the virtual disk to a virtual machine and implements the associated disk read write operations. Initially a disk image may comprise one raw or COW volume which may be made read only before the first boot of the virtual machine. An attempt to write to a disk by a virtual machine may modify the disk image or may trigger adding a new COW volume layer to the volume chain. The newly created volume may store disk blocks or files that have been modified or newly created by the virtual machine after the previous volume layer has been made read only. One or more volumes may be added to the volume chain during the lifetime of the virtual machine. In some implementations making the previous volume read only e.g. responsive to receiving a command via an administrative interface triggers adding of a new COW volume. The virtual disk device implemented by the hypervisor locates the data by accessing transparently to the virtual machine each volume of the chain of volumes starting from the most recently added volume.

Each of the disk images A N may store and organize information that may be loaded onto a machine e.g. virtual machine or physical machine and may be executed by the machine to provide a computing service. In one example a disk image may be generated by creating a sector by sector copy of a source medium e.g. hard drive of example machine . In another example a disk image may be generated based on an existing disk image and may be manipulated before during or after being loaded and executed. The format of the disk images A N may be based on any open standard such as the ISO image format for optical disc images or based on a proprietary format. Each disk image A N may be associated with one or more computer programs e.g. operating systems applications and configuration information e.g. configuration files registry keys state information . The configuration information may include state information that indicates the state of one or more running programs at a point in time or over a duration of time. Each state may be the same or similar to a snapshot of the machine at a particular point in time or over a duration of time. In one example the snapshot may store the state of a machine in a manner that enables it to be portable to other computing devices so that when the other computing devices loads the snapshot it may function as if it were running on the original device.

Storage metadata of secondary storage may be employed for storing references to associated volumes e.g. to parent or child volumes in a copy on write chain and or other information that may be utilized for volume identification management creation modification removal and or for performing data modification operations e.g. file operations with respect to the data stored on the volumes in the secondary storage .

Storage lease of the secondary storages may be employed for storing the information that may be utilized for managing access to the volumes in the secondary storage . In certain implementations secondary storages may provide a centralized locking facility e.g. lease manager to prevent conflicting access by multiple computing devices. By obtaining a lease from the lease manager with respect to the secondary storage a computing device may receive exclusive access to a portion of secondary storage that would prevent other hosts from accessing the portion while the lease is active. A lease may have a certain expiration period and may be extended by the requestor. Failure to timely extend a lease may lead to the expiration of the lease. The state of the current lease with respect to a given secondary storage may be stored in the lease area of the secondary storage.

In one example computing device may synchronize portions of first data storage or second data storage with secondary storage . The synchronization may involve copying saving storing replicating mirroring moving migrating or other action to update secondary storage to reflect modifications to data in data storages and or . In one example the synchronization of data storage and may involve identifying portions of memory that have been modified but have not yet been saved to secondary storage. These portions of memory may be considered dirty memory portions e.g. dirty pages dirty blocks . The dirty memory portions may be synchronized with the secondary storage by saving the data in the dirty memory portions to the secondary storage. In one example the synchronization may be a procedure that is the same or similar to a flush procedure or an update procedure that commits a portion of page cache to secondary storage.

Creation request module may receive a request to create a file object. The request may be received from a user space program an operating system a hypervisor another program or combination thereof. The request may include one or more portions of the file object. The portions of the file object may include metadata or content of the file object. The metadata may include data about the file object such as a file name ownership permissions header format encoding parent directory file system path creation time other information or a combination thereof. The content of the file object may be the data that is stored by the file object such as textual content audio content image content binary content other content or a combination thereof. The one or more portions of the file object may be received before during or after the request to create the file object. In one example the one or more portions of file object may be received as a stream of data.

Buffering module may receive the one or more portions of the file object and may temporarily store the portions e.g. first portion in a buffer in first data storage . The first data storage may be any volatile memory and may be functioning as the main memory for computing device . The buffer may be the same or similar to buffer discussed above and may be a page cache and store the one or more portions of the file object prior to being copied e.g. migrated to another storage location such second data storage e.g. non volatile memory or secondary storage e.g. hard disk .

After buffering the one or more portions computing device may analyze the buffered portions to determine information about the file object. Determining information about the file object may involve identifying information from first portion and using the identified information to predict e.g. extrapolate estimate hypothesize other information about the file object . The identified information may include information gathered directly from first portion such as information within the metadata content or a combination thereof such as the file extension size of first portion rate the first portion is being received and other information. The identified information may also include information gathered indirectly from the first portion such as information based on historical data predictive models or other techniques. In one example indirect information may be based on other files objects that have the same or similar ownership e.g. user account initiating process file extension file name format encoding or other commonality. Some or all of this information may be used to determine size information for the file object. The size information may be an actual size or a predicted size and may be a single size or a size range. The determined information e.g. size information may be used by location determination module .

Location determination module may use information about file object such as the size information e.g. predicted size to determine one or more locations in second data storage to store file object . Location determination module may select the one or more locations to reduce or eliminate storage fragmentation. Storage fragmentation e.g. file system fragmentation disk fragmentation file scattering may exist when a file object is stored in a non contiguous manner and is often due to storage space availability. For example second data storage may be partially in use and there may be multiple separate blocks of storage space and no one block may be large enough to store the entire file object. In this situation file object may be stored in a non continuous manner across multiple separate storage blocks. Location determination module may select the one or more locations to reduce fragmentation and optimize write time access time modification time other optimization or a combination thereof.

Migration module may perform a migration of the first portion from first data storage to the one or more locations in second data storage . Migrating the first portion of file object may involve locking moving copying saving storing replicating mirroring synchronizing or other action to update second data storage to reflect the data of first portion . In one example the migration of the first portion may involve preventing changes during the migration and changes to first portion that arrive during the migration may be denied e.g. produce errors and may be resubmitted after the migration completes. In another example the migration of first portion may be a live migration that does not prevent changes during the migration and may queue the changes during the migration and replay the changes after the migration completes. Completing the migration may involve copying the first portion to second data storage and removing e.g. dereferencing first portion from first data storage .

Migration may also involve removing a reference in the first data storage that points to a location in the buffer where file object was stored. The reference may be included within a data structure of the buffer e.g. page cache data structure . In one example removing the reference that points to a location in the buffer may involve updating the reference within the volatile storage to point to the determined location in the non volatile storage. In another example removing the reference may involve deleting the reference from a data structure of the buffer. Computing device may then analyze the file system and repopulate the data structure after the migration completes with a reference that points to the determined location. In either example computing device may access the reference before during or after receiving a subsequent portion e.g. second portion of file object . Computing device may then store one or more of the subsequent portions in second data storage without allowing them to be stored in first data storage . In one example the first portion may be one or more pages in a page cache and the migration may be implemented as a page migration or sequence of page migrations performed by a kernel of either the hypervisor or the operating system e.g. guest or host operating system .

For simplicity of explanation the methods of this disclosure are depicted and described as a series of acts. However acts in accordance with this disclosure can occur in various orders and or concurrently and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore not all illustrated acts may be needed to implement the methods in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In addition those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the methods could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events. Additionally it should be appreciated that the methods disclosed in this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to computing devices. The term article of manufacture as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device or storage media. In one implementation methods and may be performed by computing device or system as shown in respectively.

Referring to method may be performed by processing devices of a computing device and may begin at block . At block a processing device may receive a request to create a file object. The request may be received by a file system module e.g. driver or subsystem from a user space program an operating system a hypervisor another program or combination thereof. The request may include one or more portions of the file object. The portions of the file object may include metadata or content of the file object and may be received before during or after the request to create the file object.

At block the processing device may store a first portion of the file object in a buffer in a first data storage. The first data storage may be any type of volatile memory and may be functioning as the main memory for the processing device. In one example the buffer comprises a page cache and the page cache may be managed by a kernel of the operating system or hypervisor.

At block the processing device may determine a location in a second data storage in view of a predicted size of the file object. The predicted size of the file object may be determined in view of the first portion of the file object before receiving the second portion of the file object. Determining the location comprises searching for one or more locations in the second data storage that reduce storage fragmentation of the file object. In one example the processing device may allocate storage space for the file object at the location in the second data storage after determining the predicted size of the file object.

At block the processing device may migrate the first portion of the file object from the buffer to the location in the second data storage. Migrating the first portion of the file object may involve performing a page migration procedure. In one example migrating the first portion of the file object from the buffer to the second data storage involves copying the first portion of the file object in the volatile storage to the location in the non volatile storage. The migration may also involve updating a reference within the buffer that points to a location in the volatile storage to point to the determined location in the non volatile storage and removing the first portion of the file object from the page cache in volatile storage.

At block the processing device may in response to receiving a second portion of the file object directly store the second portion in the second data storage. Directly storing the second portion in the second data storage may involve bypassing the buffer and storing the second portion directly in the second data storage without storing the second portion in the buffer in the first data storage. In one example the processing device may access the buffer to identify a location in the second data structure but may avoid storing the second portion in the first data storage. In another example the processing device may avoid accessing the first data storage for information related to the file object e.g. reference after the migration begins or has completed.

The first data storage may be volatile storage comprising main memory and the second data storage may be non volatile storage comprising non volatile memory. In one example the second data storage comprises direct access non volatile memory that enables a user space process running on an operating system to bypass a kernel of the operating system and execute a load instruction for the non volatile memory. In another example the second data storage emulates direct access non volatile memory by storing data in volatile memory and synchronizing the data to a file on a secondary storage comprising a hard disk drive. Responsive to completing the operations described herein above with references to block the method may terminate.

The migration may also involve updating a reference within the buffer that points to a location in the volatile storage to point to the determined location in the non volatile storage and removing the first portion of the file object from the page cache in volatile storage.

At block the processing device may store the second portion in the second data storage directly. Directly storing the second portion in the second data storage may involve bypassing the buffer and storing the second portion directly in the second data storage without storing the second portion in the buffer in the first data storage.

In another example the processing device may avoid accessing the first data storage for information related to the file object e.g. reference after the migration begins or has completed.

The second data storage may be non volatile storage comprising non volatile memory.
